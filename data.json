{"title": "Perplexity Is a Bullshit Machine", "text": "Considering Perplexity\u2019s bold ambition and the investment it\u2019s taken from Jeff Bezos\u2019 family fund, Nvidia, and famed investor Balaji Srinivasan, among others, it\u2019s surprisingly unclear what the AI search startup actually is.\n\nEarlier this year, speaking to WIRED, Aravind Srinivas, Perplexity\u2019s CEO, described his product\u2014a chatbot that gives natural-language answers to prompts and can, the company says, access the internet in real time\u2014as an \u201canswer engine.\u201d A few weeks later, shortly before a funding round valuing the company at a billion dollars was announced, he told Forbes, \u201cIt\u2019s almost like Wikipedia and ChatGPT had a kid.\u201d More recently, after Forbes accused Perplexity of plagiarizing its content, Srinivas told the AP it was a mere \u201caggregator of information.\u201d\n\nThe Perplexity chatbot itself is more specific. Prompted to describe what Perplexity is, it provides text that reads, \u201cPerplexity AI is an AI-powered search engine that combines features of traditional search engines and chatbots. It provides concise, real-time answers to user queries by pulling information from recent articles and indexing the web daily.\u201d\n\nA WIRED analysis and one carried out by developer Robb Knight suggest that Perplexity is able to achieve this partly through apparently ignoring a widely accepted web standard known as the Robots Exclusion Protocol to surreptitiously scrape areas of websites that operators do not want accessed by bots, despite claiming that it won\u2019t. WIRED observed a machine tied to Perplexity\u2014more specifically, one on an Amazon server and almost certainly operated by Perplexity\u2014doing this on WIRED.com and across other Cond\u00e9 Nast publications.\n\nThe WIRED analysis also demonstrates that, despite claims that Perplexity\u2019s tools provide \u201cinstant, reliable answers to any question with complete sources and citations included,\u201d doing away with the need to \u201cclick on different links,\u201d its chatbot, which is capable of accurately summarizing journalistic work with appropriate credit, is also prone to bullshitting, in the technical sense of the word.\n\nWIRED provided the Perplexity chatbot with the headlines of dozens of articles published on our website this year, as well as prompts about the subjects of WIRED reporting. The results showed the chatbot at times closely paraphrasing WIRED stories, and at times summarizing stories inaccurately and with minimal attribution. In one case, the text it generated falsely claimed that WIRED had reported that a specific police officer in California had committed a crime. (The AP similarly identified an instance of the chatbot attributing fake quotes to real people.) Despite its apparent access to original WIRED reporting and its site hosting original WIRED art, though, none of the IP addresses publicly listed by the company left any identifiable trace in our server logs, raising the question of how exactly Perplexity\u2019s system works.\n\nUntil earlier this week, Perplexity published in its documentation a link to a list of the IP addresses its crawlers use\u2014an apparent effort to be transparent. However, in some cases, as both WIRED and Knight were able to demonstrate, it appears to be accessing and scraping websites from which coders have attempted to block its crawler, called Perplexity Bot, using at least one unpublicized IP address. The company has since removed references to its public IP pool from its documentation.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast', 'Dhruv Mehrotra', 'Tim Marchman', 'Matt Burgess', 'Matthew Gault', 'Dell Cameron', 'William Turton', 'Jordan Pearson', 'Justin Pot']", "top_image": "https://media.wired.com/photos/6670da166e536acf9ad7948a/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/business_perplexity_ai_plagiarism.jpg", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "Perplexity Plagiarized Our Story About How Perplexity Is a Bullshit Machine", "text": "Earlier this week, WIRED published a story about the AI-powered search startup Perplexity, which Forbes has accused of plagiarism. In it, my colleague Dhruv Mehrotra and I reported that the company was surreptitiously scraping, using crawlers to visit and download parts of websites from which developers had tried to block it, in violation of its own publicly stated policy of honoring the Robots Exclusion Protocol.\n\nOur findings, as well as those of the developer Robb Knight, identified a specific IP address almost certainly linked to Perplexity and not listed in its public IP range, which we observed scraping test sites in apparent response to prompts given to the company\u2019s public-facing chatbot. According to server logs, that same IP visited properties belonging to Cond\u00e9 Nast, the media company that owns WIRED, at least 822 times in the past three months\u2014likely a significant undercount, because the company retains only a small portion of its records.\n\nWe also reported that the chatbot was bullshitting, in the technical sense. In one experiment, it generated text about a girl following a trail of mushrooms when asked to summarize the content of a website that its agent did not, according to server logs, attempt to access.\n\nPerplexity and its CEO, Aravind Srinivas, did not substantively dispute the specifics of WIRED\u2019s reporting. \u201cThe questions from WIRED reflect a deep and fundamental misunderstanding of how Perplexity and the Internet work,\u201d Srinivas said in a statement. Backed by Jeff Bezos\u2019 family office and by Nvidia, among others, Perplexity has said it is worth a billion dollars based on its most recent fundraising round, and The Information reported last month that it was in talks for a new round that would value it at $3 billion. (Bezos did not reply to an email; Nvidia declined to comment.)\n\nAfter we published the story, I prompted three leading chatbots to tell me about the story. OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Anthropic\u2019s Claude generated text offering hypotheses about the story\u2019s subject but noted that they had no access to the article. The Perplexity chatbot produced a six-paragraph, 287-word text closely summarizing the conclusions of the story and the evidence used to reach them. (According to WIRED's server logs, the same bot observed in our and Knight\u2019s findings, which is almost certainly linked to Perplexity but is not in its publicly listed IP range, attempted to access the article the day it was published, but was met with a 404 response. The company doesn't retain all its traffic logs, so this is not necessarily a complete picture of the bot's activity, or that of other Perplexity agents.) The original story is linked at the top of the generated text, and a small gray circle links out to the original following each of the last five paragraphs. The last third of the fifth paragraph exactly reproduces a sentence from the original: \u201cInstead, it invented a story about a young girl named Amelia who follows a trail of glowing mushrooms in a magical forest called Whisper Woods.\u201d\n\nThis struck me and my colleagues as plagiarism. It certainly appears to satisfy the criteria set out by Poynter Institute\u2014including, perhaps most stringently, the seven-to-10 word test, which proposes that it\u2019s \u201chard to incidentally replicate seven consecutive words that appear in another author\u2019s work.\u201d (Kelly McBride, a Poynter SVP who has described this test as being useful in identifying plagiarism, did not reply to an email.)", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast', 'Tim Marchman', 'Dmitri Alperovitch', 'Kim Zetter', 'Joseph Cox', 'Matt Burgess']", "top_image": "https://media.wired.com/photos/6674be51bceccd49894c90bc/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/security_perplexity_plagiarize_story.jpg", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

On LinkedIn, however, the startup community gave a less-than-enthusiastic response. Those commenters pointed out that Wang\u2019s post made it seem as if \u201cmeritocracy\u201d was the definitive benchmark to find qualified hiring candidates \u2014 without taking into consideration that the idea of meritocracy is itself subjective. In the days that have followed the post, more and more people have shared their thoughts and what Wang\u2019s comments reveal about the current state of DEI in tech.\n\n\u201cThe post is misguided because people who support the meritocracy argument are ignoring the structural reasons some groups are more likely to outperform others,\u201d Mutale Nkonde, a founder working in AI policy, told TechCrunch. \u201dWe all want the best people for the job, and there is data to prove that diverse teams are more effective.\u201d\n\nEmily Witko, an HR professional at AI startup Hugging Face, told TechCrunch that the post was a \u201cdangerous oversimplification,\u201d but that it received so much attention on X because it \u201copenly expressed sentiments that are not always expressed publicly and the audience there is hungry to attack DEI.\u201d Wang\u2019s MEI thought \u201cmakes it so easy to refute or criticize any conversations regarding the importance of acknowledging underrepresentation in tech,\u201d she continued.\n\nBut Wang is far from the only Silicon Valley insider to attack DEI in recent months. He joins a chorus of those who feel that DEI programs implemented at businesses over the past several years, peaking with the Black Lives Matter movement, caused a backslide in corporate profitability \u2014 and that a return to \u201cmeritocratic principles\u201d is overdue. Indeed, much of the tech industry has worked to dismantle recruitment programs that considered candidates who, under previous hiring regimes, were often overlooked in the hiring process.\n\nSeeking to make a change, in 2020, many organizations and power players came together to promise more of a focus on DEI, which, contrary to the mainstream discussion, is not simply about hiring someone based on the color of their skin but is about ensuring qualified people from all walks of life \u2014 regardless of skin, gender, or ethnic background \u2014 are better represented and included in recruitment funnels. It\u2019s also about taking a look at disparities and pipeline issues, analyzing the reasoning behind why certain candidates are constantly overlooked in a hiring process.\n\nIn 2023, the U.S. data industry saw new women recruit levels drop by two-thirds, from 36% in 2022 to just 12%, according to a report from HR staffing firm Harnham. Meanwhile, the percentage of Black, Indigenous, and professionals of color in VP or above data roles stood at just 38% in 2022.\n\nAlexandr Wang (pictured above) caused a stir on social media when he posted about meritocracy in tech on X. Image Credits: Drew Angerer / Staff / Getty Images\n\nDEI-related job listings have also fallen out of favor, declining 44% in 2023, according to data from the job site Indeed. In the AI industry, a recent Deloitte survey of women found that over half said they ended up leaving at least one employer because of how men and women were treated differently, while 73% considered leaving the tech industry altogether due to unequal pay and an inability to advance in their careers.\n\nYet, for an industry that prides itself on being data-driven, Silicon Valley cannot let the idea of a meritocracy go \u2014 despite all the data and research showing how such thinking is just a belief system and one that can lead to biased outcomes. The idea of going out and hiring \u201cthe best person for the job\u201d without taking into account any human sociology is how pattern-matching occurs \u2014 teams and companies of people who are alike, when the research has long shown that more diverse teams perform better. Moreover, it has only raised suspicions about who the Valley considers excellent and why.\n\nExperts we spoke to said this subjectiveness revealed other issues with Wang\u2019s missive \u2014 mostly that he presents MEI as a revolutionary idea and not one that Silicon Valley and most of corporate America have long embraced. The acronym \u201cMEI\u201d appears to be a scornful nod to DEI, intended to drive home the notion that a company must choose between hiring diverse candidates or candidates that meet certain \u201cobjective\u201d qualifications.\n\nNatalie Sue Johnson, co-founder of the DEI consulting firm Paradigm, told TechCrunch that research has shown meritocracy to be a paradox and that organizations that focus too much on it actually see an increase in bias. \u201cIt frees people up from thinking that they have to try hard to be fair in their decision-making,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey think that meritocracy is inherent, not something that needs to be achieved.\u201d\n\nAs Nkonde mentioned, Johnson noted that Wang\u2019s approach doesn\u2019t acknowledge that underrepresented groups face systemic barriers society is still struggling to address. Ironically, the most meritorious person could be the one who has achieved a skill set for a job despite such barriers that may have influenced their educational background or prevented them from filling their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with the kind of college internships that impresses Silicon Valley.\n\nTreating a person as a faceless, nameless candidate, without understanding their unique experiences, and therefore their employability, is a mistake, Johnson said. \u201cThere is nuance.\u201d\n\nWitko added to that: \u201cA meritocratic system is built on criteria that reflect the status quo, and therefore, it will perpetuate existing inequalities by continuously favoring those who already have advantages.\u201d\n\nTo be somewhat charitable to Wang, given how acidic the term DEI has become, developing a new term that still represents the value of fairness to all candidates, isn\u2019t a terrible idea \u2014 even if \u201cmeritocracy\u201d is misguided. And his post suggests that Scale AI\u2019s values could align with the spirit of diversity, equity, and inclusion even if he might not realize it, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cCasting a wide net for talent and making objective hiring decisions that do not disadvantage candidates based on identity is exactly what diversity, equity, and inclusion work seeks to do,\u201d she explained.\n\nBut again, where Wang undermines this is endorsing the mistaken belief that meritocracy will produce outcomes based on one\u2019s abilities and merits alone.\n\nPerhaps it is all a paradox. If one looks at Scale AI\u2019s treatment of its data annotators \u2014 many of whom live in third-world countries and scrape by on little pay \u2014 it suggests the company has scant real interest in disrupting the status quo.\n\nScale AI\u2019s annotators work on tasks for multiple eight-hour workdays \u2014 no breaks \u2014 for pay ranging as low as $10 (per the Verge and NY Mag). It\u2019s on the backs of these annotators that Scale AI has built a business worth over $13 billion and with more than $1.6 billion in cash in the bank.\n\nWhen asked for comment on the allegations made in the Verge and NY Mag piece, a spokesperson pointed to this blog post, in which it described its human annotator jobs as \u201cgig work.\u201d The spokesperson didn\u2019t address TechCrunch\u2019s request for clarification on Scale AI\u2019s MEI policy.\n\nJohnson said Wang\u2019s post is a great example of the box many leaders and companies find themselves trapped in.\n\nShe pondered, can they trust that having meritocratic ideals is enough to lead to truly meritocratic outcomes, and promote diversity?\n\n\u201cOr, do they acknowledge that ideals are not enough, and to truly build more diverse workforces where everyone has the same access to opportunities and can do their best work requires intention?\u201d", "authors": "['Dominic-Madori Davis', 'Kyle Wiggers']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DEI-big-bad-wolf.jpg?resize=1200,645", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

It\u2019s also about taking a look at disparities and pipeline issues, analyzing the reasoning behind why certain candidates are constantly overlooked in a hiring process.\n\nIn 2023, the U.S. data industry saw new women recruit levels drop by two-thirds, from 36% in 2022 to just 12%, according to a report from HR staffing firm Harnham. Meanwhile, the percentage of Black, Indigenous, and professionals of color in VP or above data roles stood at just 38% in 2022.\n\nAlexandr Wang (pictured above) caused a stir on social media when he posted about meritocracy in tech on X. Image Credits: Drew Angerer / Staff / Getty Images\n\nDEI-related job listings have also fallen out of favor, declining 44% in 2023, according to data from the job site Indeed. In the AI industry, a recent Deloitte survey of women found that over half said they ended up leaving at least one employer because of how men and women were treated differently, while 73% considered leaving the tech industry altogether due to unequal pay and an inability to advance in their careers.\n\nYet, for an industry that prides itself on being data-driven, Silicon Valley cannot let the idea of a meritocracy go \u2014 despite all the data and research showing how such thinking is just a belief system and one that can lead to biased outcomes. The idea of going out and hiring \u201cthe best person for the job\u201d without taking into account any human sociology is how pattern-matching occurs \u2014 teams and companies of people who are alike, when the research has long shown that more diverse teams perform better. Moreover, it has only raised suspicions about who the Valley considers excellent and why.\n\nExperts we spoke to said this subjectiveness revealed other issues with Wang\u2019s missive \u2014 mostly that he presents MEI as a revolutionary idea and not one that Silicon Valley and most of corporate America have long embraced. The acronym \u201cMEI\u201d appears to be a scornful nod to DEI, intended to drive home the notion that a company must choose between hiring diverse candidates or candidates that meet certain \u201cobjective\u201d qualifications.\n\nNatalie Sue Johnson, co-founder of the DEI consulting firm Paradigm, told TechCrunch that research has shown meritocracy to be a paradox and that organizations that focus too much on it actually see an increase in bias. \u201cIt frees people up from thinking that they have to try hard to be fair in their decision-making,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey think that meritocracy is inherent, not something that needs to be achieved.\u201d\n\nAs Nkonde mentioned, Johnson noted that Wang\u2019s approach doesn\u2019t acknowledge that underrepresented groups face systemic barriers society is still struggling to address. Ironically, the most meritorious person could be the one who has achieved a skill set for a job despite such barriers that may have influenced their educational background or prevented them from filling their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with the kind of college internships that impresses Silicon Valley.\n\nTreating a person as a faceless, nameless candidate, without understanding their unique experiences, and therefore their employability, is a mistake, Johnson said. \u201cThere is nuance.\u201d\n\nWitko added to that: \u201cA meritocratic system is built on criteria that reflect the status quo, and therefore, it will perpetuate existing inequalities by continuously favoring those who already have advantages.\u201d\n\nTo be somewhat charitable to Wang, given how acidic the term DEI has become, developing a new term that still represents the value of fairness to all candidates, isn\u2019t a terrible idea \u2014 even if \u201cmeritocracy\u201d is misguided. And his post suggests that Scale AI\u2019s values could align with the spirit of diversity, equity, and inclusion even if he might not realize it, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cCasting a wide net for talent and making objective hiring decisions that do not disadvantage candidates based on identity is exactly what diversity, equity, and inclusion work seeks to do,\u201d she explained.\n\nBut again, where Wang undermines this is endorsing the mistaken belief that meritocracy will produce outcomes based on one\u2019s abilities and merits alone.\n\nPerhaps it is all a paradox. If one looks at Scale AI\u2019s treatment of its data annotators \u2014 many of whom live in third-world countries and scrape by on little pay \u2014 it suggests the company has scant real interest in disrupting the status quo.\n\nScale AI\u2019s annotators work on tasks for multiple eight-hour workdays \u2014 no breaks \u2014 for pay ranging as low as $10 (per the Verge and NY Mag). It\u2019s on the backs of these annotators that Scale AI has built a business worth over $13 billion and with more than $1.6 billion in cash in the bank.\n\nWhen asked for comment on the allegations made in the Verge and NY Mag piece, a spokesperson pointed to this blog post, in which it described its human annotator jobs as \u201cgig work.\u201d The spokesperson didn\u2019t address TechCrunch\u2019s request for clarification on Scale AI\u2019s MEI policy.\n\nJohnson said Wang\u2019s post is a great example of the box many leaders and companies find themselves trapped in.\n\nShe pondered, can they trust that having meritocratic ideals is enough to lead to truly meritocratic outcomes, and promote diversity?\n\n\u201cOr, do they acknowledge that ideals are not enough, and to truly build more diverse workforces where everyone has the same access to opportunities and can do their best work requires intention?\u201d", "authors": "['Dominic-Madori Davis', 'Kyle Wiggers']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DEI-big-bad-wolf.jpg?resize=1200,645", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "How 2 high school teens raised a $500K seed round for their API startup (yes, it\u2019s AI)", "text": "Just a few weeks ago, 18-year-old best friends Christopher Fitzgerald and Nicholas Van Landschoot graduated from high school.\n\nWhile most teens their age would be living it up in their last summer before college or the adult jobs that await them, Fitzgerald and Van Landschoot are hunkered down in a VC office in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nThey\u2019re spending the summer working on their startup APIGen after they raised a $500,000 pre-seed investment from Varana Capital. Fitzgerald will head off to Penn State in the fall and Van Landschoot will move near the university but is putting his college plans on hold to be a full-time startup founder.\n\nThe money was raised while they were still in high school after a prototype for their idea garnered a lot of interest among the large Boulder community of AI enthusiasts.\n\nAPIGen is working on a platform that will build custom APIs from natural language prompts. It will be able to, for instance, allow an e-commerce business to simply ask for an API that connects its web front end to its database, and the platform will deliver it.\n\nBy API, the founders don\u2019t just mean a standard \u201capplication programming interface\u201d that allows applications to exchange data or perform some other simple workflow function. They want APIGen to create complex custom APIs that can do multiple or serial tasks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually generating the code for the APIs so that you can have business logic, actual custom functionalities within those APIs as well,\u201d Van Landschoot told TechCrunch.\n\nIn addition to web apps and databases, Fitzgerald says IoT devices are one of his startup\u2019s target areas. He offers the example of a customer asking for an API that instructs a drone to fly around the perimeter of an area, capture images and allow another application to interface with the result. Another example is an API that uses face recognition for building security. Once a database of photos of verified employee faces is created, the user could ask APIGen for an API that lets a smartlock\u2019s door camera check the face of everyone who arrives against that database before unlocking the door.\n\n\u201cAPIs at the end of the day, can be as simple or as complex as you make them to be,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cThey can range from just new connectors that take one entry of data, one row of data from a table of a database, to entire back ends. And that\u2019s really what we\u2019re trying to target there, for entire web apps for entire IoT applications.\u201d\n\nThe teens met on their school\u2019s debate team and bonded over their love of coding. Their first project together was a chatbot that would allow people to chat with data. They soon realized that it wasn\u2019t an original idea. Still, while building that app, they learned that their tech relied on APIs and that \u201cmaking APIs was kind of a pain,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cThey were hard to design.\u201d\n\nSo they focused on that. Once they crafted an alpha version of their idea, a demo-level tool, they began to show it around to the programmers in their circle to get feedback. They knew people in their local tech industry. Van Landschoot\u2019s dad works in cybersecurity IT, and Fitzgerald landed a summer internship as a programmer at SoftBank through a connection with a friend\u2019s dad.\n\nAnd then they started sending cold messages to VCs on LinkedIn and to anyone else they thought might respond.\n\n\u201cWe asked people to destroy this pitch deck,\u201d Fitzgerald said.\n\nPhil Broenniman (left), Ankur Ahuja (right), Varana Capital Image Credits: Varana Capital\n\nA VC is so impressed, he offers to invest\n\nOne of the people who got the message \u2014 and had heard about the founders through other connections in Denver/Boulder\u2019s tight-knit startup community \u2014 was Philip Broenniman, founder of Denver\u2019s Varana Capital. Varana began as a family office for Broenniman and an \u201cultra wealthy\u201d friend, and in its 13 years since, it has expanded into a firm with institutional LP money and $400 million in AUM, he told TechCrunch\n\nBroenniman and Varana COO Ankur Ahuja agreed to meet with the teens. \u201cWe went into the meeting thinking we were going to provide some fatherly, avuncular advice; provide some words of wisdom,\u201d Broenniman told TechCrunch. \u201cWe walked out after two hours of their presentation thinking that this was the best presentation we had heard in the last five years. We were blown away by the cogent insights these two 18-year-olds gave.\u201d\n\nWith Fitzgerald dressed in his best sweater and Van Landschoot in a debate-team-style collared shirt, they leaned into their debate training and pitched their company, their vision, the potential market and themselves.\n\nRather than feedback on the pitch, \u201cAt the end of the meeting, they mentioned that they were actually interested,\u201d Fitzgerald said of the Varana partners. Broenniman asked the teens how much money they were looking for.\n\nVarana did its diligence looking into the potential of the API market, which has created multibillion dollars\u2019 worth of successes (MuleSoft bought by Salesforce, Apigee bought by Google, to name just two). And it looked at the founders\u2019 backgrounds: Fitzgerald graduated as valedictorian of a top-ranked high school in Boulder, which has a highly ranked public education system; Van Landschoot was such a gifted programmer that he had been tutoring college computer science students since he was 14.\n\nThe Varana partners scheduled a second meeting for the founders to demo their tech to make sure the teens weren\u2019t just \u201cgood at talking but not delivering and doing stuff,\u201d as Van Landschoot described.\n\nThe teens were nervous, they confessed, but the demo went well and the VC offered a term sheet: $250,000 of pre-seed money with another $250,000 in a SAFE, which is a note that converts to equity if the startup raises later. The VC also provided office space.\n\nWhile they were pitching to the VCs, Fitzgerald learned about Boulder\u2019s active AI Meetup that has 1,400 members, organized by a dad of one of Fitzgerald\u2019s tennis team teammates. Boulder has a famously close and cozy startup community and, along with nearby Denver, hosts office outposts for Amazon, IBM, Google, Microsoft and many others.\n\nThe teens joined the group and demoed their product, and the local AI enthusiasts rallied behind them and their idea.\n\nAPIGen is obviously very early. And it isn\u2019t the only one working on automating APIs. Giant tech companies like Salesforce\u2019s MuleSoft and established startups like RapidAPI are already working on this market, as are most of the cloud giants.\n\nAPIGen also doesn\u2019t yet have its minimum viable product built, though it\u2019s getting closer with a beta version that will be released this month. \u201cWe\u2019ve already had some interest from businesses, but obviously we\u2019re still pre-MVP at this stage, and just cranking, trying to get it out as soon as possible,\u201d Fitzgerald said.\n\nStill, Broenniman, who takes board seats with investments, is in for the ride. He points to how the young founders have already built a community of eager supporters.\n\n\u201cAPIGen may be the vehicle into which we\u2019re making an investment, but we\u2019re creating partnership with Christopher and Nicholas,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a $7 billion-plus market. They are entering with some elements of competition there but are carving out their own space. The opportunity for return from our standpoint is insane.\u201d", "authors": "['Julie Bort']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Christopher-Fitzgerald-Nicholas-Van-Landschoo-APIGen.jpg?resize=1200,682", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

#https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/23/the-eu-digital-identity-wallet-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-eus-plans-for-a-universal-digital-identity-system/
{"title": "The EU Digital Identity Wallet: Everything you need to know about the EU\u2019s plans for a universal digital identity system", "text": "The EU Digital Identity Wallet is an ambitious project by the European Union that\u2019s still a bit under the radar but worth paying attention to, as it could deliver big things in the next few years.\n\nThe goal is to set up a universal digital identity system for citizens. If all goes to plan, Europeans will be able to download and use a free EU Digital Identity Wallet to access a wide range of public and private services, relying on identity verification and authentication of other credentials stored in an app on their smartphone.\n\nFollowing recent adoption of a key legal framework, EU countries are expected to issue the first of EU Digital Identity Wallets by the end of 2026. Unlike current national e-ID schemes, the future Pan-EU wallets will be recognized by all member states.\n\nWhile national e-ID systems have been available in some European countries for many years \u2014 Estonia is a particular pioneer in digital identity \u2014 regional lawmakers have, since 2021, set themselves the goal of creating conditions for a digital identity system that works across the bloc\u2019s single market.\n\nSo while there won\u2019t be a single, universal EU wallet app for everyone to use, the goal is to establish a system where different wallet apps will work anywhere in the EU, aligning with the bloc\u2019s Digital Single Market mission.\n\nAn EU digital ID wallet for everything?\n\nOne obvious motivation for setting up the EU Digital Identity Wallet is convenience.\n\nEuropeans will be able to download a wallet app to their smartphone or device and use it to store and selectively share key credentials when they need to do things like verify their identity or prove their age. The wallet will work both for ID checks online and in the real world. It\u2019s also intended as a digital repository for official documents, such as a driver\u2019s license, medical prescriptions, educational qualifications, passports, etc. E-signing functionality will also be supported.\n\nSo less hassle managing different bits of paper, or even remembering where you put your bank cards, is the general idea.\n\nBut there are other more strategic motivating factors in play. The bloc has woken up to the value of data in our fast-accelerating AI age. Policies that remove friction and grease the flow of information \u2014 or at least try to when it comes to getting citizens to share personal data to do things like sign up for new services or to transact \u2014 fit the political game plan.\n\nThe EU has an extensive and growing body of digital regulation. A Pan-EU e-ID would clearly come in very handy here. For example, aspects of the online governance regime established by the Digital Services Act (DSA) could be easier to implement once the EU can point to having a \u201cuniversal, secure and trustworthy\u201d digital ID system in place, as the EU Digital Identity Wallet is being billed. Think privacy-preserving access to adult content websites for people who could use the digital ID to verify they\u2019re over 18, for example.\n\nAnother big EU digital policy push in recent years aims to remove barriers to the sharing and reuse of data, including across internal borders, by setting up infrastructure and rules for so-called Common European Data Spaces. Again, a universal EU digital ID that promises citizens privacy and autonomy could make Europeans more comfortable doing more info-sharing \u2014 helping data flow into these strategic spaces.\n\nInterestingly, though, the EU\u2019s president, Ursula von der Leyen, opted for a very different framing for the opportunity for the wallet when announcing the plan in her September 2020 State of the Union address, pointing to growing privacy risks for citizens who are constantly being asked to share data in order to access online services. The wallet responds to this concern because a core feature is support for selective data sharing. So in addition to an EU pledge that use of the wallet will remain voluntary for citizens, the main pitch to users is that it\u2019s \u201cprivacy-preserving\u201d as they get to remain in control: selecting which data they share with whom.\n\nHaving a privacy-preserving approach could help the EU unlock finer-grained digital regulation opportunities, too, though. As noted above, it could give citizens a means to share their verified age but not their identity, allowing a wallet app user to sign into an age-restricted service anonymously. The EU wants the wallets to support wider governance goals under the DSA, which look set to usher in harder age verification requirements for services with content that might be inappropriate for kids \u2014 that is, once the appropriate \u201cprivacy preserving\u201d tech exists.\n\nOther use cases for the wallet that the EU has discussed include an apartment-rental scenario where a citizen could share a bunch of verified intel about their rental history with a potential landlord without having to confirm their identity unless/until they get to sign the contract. Or someone with multiple bank accounts around the Union could use it to simplify transaction authorizations.\n\nOnline services will be obliged to accept the Pan-EU credential. So it\u2019s also being pitched as a European alternative to existing (commercial) digital identity offerings, such as the \u201csign in with\u201d credentials offered by Big Tech players, like Apple and Google.\n\nChallenging Big Tech\u2019s grip on data\n\nHere the bloc\u2019s lawmakers look to be responding to concerns about how much power has been ceded to platform giants on account of the key digital infrastructure they own and operate.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise the EU Digital Identity Wallet proposal was adopted by the Commission in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, when apps that could display a person\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination status were on everyone\u2019s mind. But the public health crisis also starkly underscored an asymmetrical power dynamic between lawmakers and the commercial giants controlling mainstream mobile technology infrastructure. (Apple and Google literally set rules on how COVID-19 exposure notification data could be exchanged, with their technical choices overriding governments\u2019 directly stated preferences in several cases.)\n\nBeyond considerations of strategic digital sovereignty, a universal e-ID wallet concept ties tightly to the EU\u2019s general push to amp up digitalization as a flywheel for better economic fortunes. Assuming the system is well-executed and reliable, and the wallets themselves are user friendly and easy to use, a universal EU ID could boost productivity by increasing efficiency and uptake of online services.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s a big \u201cif\u201d; there are sizable technical challenges to delivering on the EU vision for the universal ID system.\n\nSecurity and privacy are obviously essential pieces of the puzzle. The first is fundamental for any identity and authentication system to fly. The second comprises the bloc\u2019s main pitch to citizens who will need to be persuaded to adopt the wallets if the whole project isn\u2019t to end up an expensive white elephant.\n\nPoor implementation is a clear risk. Low uptake of flaky national e-ID scheme shows what could go wrong. Wallet apps will need to be slick and easy to use across the full sweep of planned use cases, as well as having robust security and privacy \u2014 which demands a whole ecosystem of players get behind the project \u2014 or users simply won\u2019t get on board.\n\nRemember, competition on digital identity is coming from already baked-in mainstream platform offerings, like \u201cSign in with Google.\u201d And, sadly, convenience and ease-of-use still often trump privacy concerns in the online arena.\n\nPrivacy could also create barriers to adoption. After the proposal was unveiled, there were some reservations expressed about the EU setting up a universal ID infrastructure, with some commentators invoking the risk of function-creep toward a China-style social control. Having a credible technical architecture that both secures and firewalls citizens\u2019 data will therefore be critical to success.\n\nUniversal availability by 2030\n\nGetting the EU Digital Identity Wallet system off the ground has already involved years of preparatory work, but there\u2019s plenty more testing, standard setting and implementation ahead.\n\nSo far the bloc has put in place a legal framework for interoperable EU wallets (i.e., the Digital Identity Regulation, which entered into force in May this year). Work on the development of a secure technical architecture, common standards and specifications is ongoing, but a common EU Toolbox has been established. The Commission has also published an architecture reference on GitHub. Code is being open sourced, and the EU intends ecosystem infrastructure to be based on common standards to drive trust and adoption.\n\nThe bloc is also engaged with industry and public sector stakeholders on large-scale pilots to test the proposed technical specifications.\n\nMore paving needs to be laid in the coming years, including through a series of implementing acts affirming critical technical details. Plenty could still go wrong. But the EU has at least given itself a fairly generous lead-in to get this one right. So while the first wallets are supposed to be coming online in a couple years\u2019 time, the bloc is not expecting universal system access for its circa 450 million citizens until 2030.", "authors": "['Natasha Lomas']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1150039017.jpg?resize=1200,660", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "Apple might partner with Meta on AI", "text": "As Apple enters the AI race, it\u2019s also looking for help from partners.\n\nDuring the announcement of Apple Intelligence earlier this month, Apple said it would be partnering with OpenAI to bring ChatGPT into the revamped version of Siri. Now, the Wall Street Journal reports that Apple and Facebook\u2019s parent company Meta are in talks around a similar deal.\n\nThese talks have reportedly not been finalized and could still fall through. Meta declined to comment; Apple did not immediately respond.\n\nAs Sarah Perez noted, Apple\u2019s approach to AI currently sounds a bit boring and practical \u2014 rather than treating this as an opportunity for wholesale reinvention or disruption, it\u2019s starting out by adding AI-powered features (like writing suggestions and custom emojis) to its existing products. But emphasizing practicality over flashiness might be the key to AI adoption. Then, Apple can leverage partnerships to go beyond the capabilities of its own AI models.\n\nSo a deal with Meta could make Apple less reliant on a single partner, while also providing validation for Meta\u2019s generative AI tech. The Journal reports that Apple\u2019s isn\u2019t offering to pay for these partnerships; instead, Apple provides distribution to AI partners who can then sell premium subscriptions.\n\nAnd while Elon Musk, who co-founded OpenAI but is now competing with it through his new startup xAI, seemed so concerned about the possibility that ChatGPT would be deeply integrated with Apple\u2019s operating systems that he threatened to ban Apple devices from his companies, Apple has said it will ask for users\u2019 permission before sharing any questions and data with ChatGPT. Presumably, any integration with Meta would work similarly.\n\nIn another recent development, Apple has also said that while Apple Intelligence is set to roll out in the newest versions of its operating systems (including iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia) later this year, it plans to hold the technology back from the European Union, due to the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act (which is supposed to encourage competition in digital markets). It also said it will hold back iPhone Mirroring and SharePlay Screen Sharing.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that the interoperability requirements of the DMA could force us to compromise the integrity of our products in ways that risk user privacy and data security,\u201d the company said in a statement.", "authors": "['Anthony Ha']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WWDC-2024-Apple-Intelligence-iPhone-Limits.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "X still has a Verified bot problem \u2014 this time they came for TechCrunch writers", "text": "This week while scrolling on X, formerly Twitter, I noticed that I had reposted a series of TechCrunch articles. Except, wait, no, I hadn\u2019t.\n\nBut someone else using my name had. I clicked on the profile, and there was another Rebecca Bellan, using the same default and header photos as my actual profile: me onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2022 and side-eye Chloe, respectively. The bio read, \u201c@Techcrunch senior reporter | journalist,\u201d and it had the location set to NY, where I am currently based. The account was created in May 2024.\n\nPerhaps most surprising after realizing that someone \u2014 who? A bot?! \u2014 had created an impersonator account of me was the fact that they had ostensibly paid to do so, as evidenced by the little blue checkmark next to my name.\n\nWhen X was still Twitter, the blue checkmark would let other users know that a profile had been verified as a person of note. But since Elon Musk\u2019s hostile takeover, that checkmark now means that a user has paid at least $8 per month for a premium subscription that gets them access to longer posts, fewer ads, better algorithmic consideration and Grok. And while X changed tack in April and gave the verification badge back to some users based on number of followers, the blue checkmark could also mean someone is a fan of Musk. Don\u2019t believe me? Just check all the zealous reply guys on any of Musk\u2019s posts.\n\nAnyway, I am neither a paid subscriber nor a fan.\n\nI\u2019m also not the only one who was targeted with impersonation accounts. A handful of TechCrunch journalists have also been impersonated on the platform. Some of the accounts, including my own fake one, have been suspended after being reported to X. But this only tells us that X is actively aware of this problem.\n\nAnd the problem is that impersonation attacks like these are so much easier to carry out because of the degradation of X\u2019s verification system, which actually doesn\u2019t seem to require any identity verification at all. Having a pay-to-play blue check system just begs bad actors and nation-states to abuse it.\n\nReally, X should have learned its lesson by now. When Musk initially rolled out what was then called Twitter Blue in November 2023, the feature was quickly weaponized to help bad actors pretend to be celebrities, corporations and government officials. One account impersonated pharma company Eli Lilly and posted a fake announcement that insulin is now free. That tweet was viewed millions of times before it was removed, and the company\u2019s stock took a hit as a result.\n\nAnother account pretended to be basketball star LeBron James and posted that he was officially asking for a trade from the Lakers team. Another posed as Connor McDavid and announced that the hockey player\u2019s contract had been bought by the New York Islanders.\n\nThe accounts pretending to be TechCrunch journalists have been, so far, benign. All they\u2019ve done is repost content that honestly any one of us might have reposted anyway. This suggests that, rather than particularly malicious actors, the accounts were likely created by bots.\n\nWe\u2019ve been covering X\u2019s Verified user bot problem for some time. The irony is that Musk suggested that forcing users to pay for verification would actually weed out the bots on the platform, but clearly that\u2019s not the case.\n\nFor those who have been impersonated, you can report it to X, which will make you do a third-party verification that involves uploading photos of your government-issued ID and a selfie. I also asked co-workers, friends and followers to report the impersonation to X on my behalf, which may have expedited the process.\n\nX did not respond to TechCrunch to provide comment on how many of its users might actually be bots, why this problem is still occurring, or what the platform is doing to solve it.", "authors": "['Rebecca Bellan']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-20-at-8.40.46\u202fAM.png?resize=1200,762", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "\u200b\u200bWhat Vinod Khosla Says He\u2019s \u2018Worried About the Most\u2019", "text": "Vinod Khosla is more popular than ever right now. The Sun Microsystems co-founder turned prominent investor \u2014 first at Kleiner Perkins and, for the last 20 years, at his venture firm Khosla Ventures \u2014 has always been sought after by founders thanks to his no-nonsense advice and his firm\u2019s track record, including bets on Stripe, Square, Affirm, and DoorDash. But a $50 million gamble on OpenAI back in 2019 \u2013 when it was far from clear that the outfit would succeed on the scale that it has \u2013 put Khosla Ventures, and Khosla himself, squarely in the spotlight.\n\nHe\u2019s thoroughly enjoying himself. I sat down with Khosla this past week in Toronto at the Collision conference, and ahead of our stage appearance, he told me that he\u2019s been appearing in public \u2013 either on stage or on podcasts or television interviews \u2013 several times a week lately. Asked if he was exhausted by the schedule \u2013 for example, he flew into Toronto just hours before our sit-down \u2013 he shrugged off the suggestion.\n\nCertainly, there are things he prefers to talk about, and the art of deal-making is not among these things. \u201cFrankly, the investor side is much less interesting to me,\u201d he said when I asked him about something I heard recently, which is that he hasn\u2019t taken a dollar in management fees since starting Khosla Ventures, despite that it now has $18 billion in assets under management. (He confirmed this, but he said that\u2019s only true of himself and not a corporate-wide policy.)\n\nHe\u2019s much more passionate about the startup opportunities he spies in a landscape being changed daily by advances in AI, so we talked about some of this white space. We also talked about what concerns him the most about AI\u2019s ripple effects; FTC Chair Lina Khan; and why, in his view, the \u201cEuropeans have regulated themselves out of leading in any technology area.\u201d\n\nWe talked first about Apple\u2019s splashy new deal with OpenAI, which allows Apple to integrate ChatGPT into Siri and its generative AI tools. Apple may be striking similar deals with other AI models, including with Meta, but naturally, as an OpenAI investor, Khosla is bullish on the tie-up, which is the only one Apple has announced publicly so far.\n\nKhosla called it \u201cvalidation\u201d for OpenAI; by announcing its pact with OpenAI during its high-profile developers\u2019 conference, Apple was also \u201cexpressing confidence, I believe, in [OpenAI CEO] Sam [Altman] to lead [developments in AI] the next five or 10 years,\u201d said Khosla. \u201cWhen a company like Apple bets on a technology, they don\u2019t change it the next year usually.\u201d\n\nBut was it good news and also bad news for Khosla, we wondered? As we\u2019ve noted in TechCrunch, many startups will likely be disrupted right out of existence by some of Apple\u2019s newest features, and it seemed likely that Khosla\u2019s portfolio companies aren\u2019t entirely immune. I was especially curious about Rabbit, whose AI-powered hardware device promises to be a kind of AI assistant to users and is backed by Khosla Ventures.\n\nAsked if the device could be made obsolete by Apple, Khosla suggested the device is more flexible than people imagine and could wind up being used by enterprises like hospitals, including in emergency room environments. He put it in the growing array of things that will \u201cwatch what you do, see what you do, and respond automatically.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Khosla suggested that his team has actively avoided anything that could become \u201croadkill\u201d as large language models like that of OpenAI progress further. And he highlighted at least one company that\u2019s not in his portfolio: Grammarly, a writing assistant startup that was valued by its backers not so long ago at $13 billion.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re doing Grammarly, say, it\u2019s really a light wrapper on today\u2019s model, and Grammarly won\u2019t keep up; it should never have been an app. It shows the need for that capability, but it will be part of Word or Google Docs. It\u2019s pretty obvious. When we talk to YC companies or others,\u201d Khosla continued, \u201cI can usually say, \u2018Half of these companies will be obsolete before the YC batch is over.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhere Khosla sees plenty of opportunities are in verticals where expertise will become near free, although it\u2019s not clear to me how these companies will sustainably make money (even after asking him). Think tutoring, or even oncology.\n\nSaid Khosla: \u201cOpen AI or Google isn\u2019t going to build a chip designer [to have on your smartphone]. OpenAI and Google aren\u2019t going to build a structural engineer. They\u2019re not going to build a primary care doctor or a mental health therapist,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there are so many areas for [founders to mine]. But they have to look at where the models are going next year and five years from now, and say, \u2018We want to leverage that capability.\u2019\n\nWe also talked about regulation. I observed that Khosla has said before that closed large language models like that of OpenAI should be safeguarded, even while there should be a regulatory framework around them. I wondered if that means that Khosla will forever forswear other, \u201copen source\u201d AI.\n\nNot at all, he said, noting that he\u2019s a \u201chuge fan\u201d of open source. Sun was one of the first companies to \u201cjump on open source,\u201d opening sourcing its file system, he said. He also noted that Khosla Ventures was the earliest investor in GitLab, whose software invites people to work on code jointly.\n\nBut he suggested that open source in the context of large language models is a different animal altogether. The \u201clargest risk we face with AI is China\u201d and \u201cpowerful Chinese AI\u201d that competes with the \u201cliberal values\u201d of the U.S., he said, adding that \u201cwe need to make sure that China stays behind us.\u201d Otherwise, he warned, it will be China providing the \u201cfree doctors and free oncologists\u201d to the rest of the world and, while they are at it, they\u2019ll \u201cexport both the economic power that comes with AI and their political philosophy.\u201d\n\nOn stage, I mentioned to Khosla my recent sit-down with FTC Chair Lina Khan, who does not believe in the national champions model as a reason to coddle outfits like Google or OpenAI as they further their development of AI.\n\nKhan hears all the time from executives and investors who say that government intervention will put the U.S. on a dangerous path. But during my sit-down with her, she argued that time and again, the U.S. has chosen \u201cthe path of competition\u201d and it has \u201cended up fueling and catalyzing so many of these breakthrough innovations and so much of the remarkable growth that our country has enjoyed and that has allowed us to stay ahead globally.\u201d\n\nIf you look at some other countries that instead chose that national champions model,\u201d Khan added at the time, \u201cthey\u2019re the ones who got left behind.\u201d\n\nI had barely mentioned Khan, however, when Khosla became dismissive, calling her \u201cnot a rational human being\u201d and accusing her of not understanding business.\n\n\u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be in that role,\u201d said Khosla. \u201cAntitrust is a good thing to have in any country, any economic system. But antitrust [that\u2019s] over enforced or over executed is bad economic policy. One thing the US has over its European rivals is much more rational business environments. That\u2019s why the Europeans have regulated themselves out of leading in any technology area; they just basically have regulated themselves out of AI, out of all social media, out of all internet startups.\u201d\n\nOf course, if some antitrust enforcement is good, but too much is not good, the question is where to draw the line. On this point, before we parted ways, I brought up the \u201cabundance\u201d that Altman foresees created by AI. During one of TechCrunch\u2019s StrictlyVC events last year, Altman said that the \u201cgood case\u201d for AI is \u201cjust so unbelievably good that you sound like a really crazy person to start talking about it.\u201d\n\nKhosla has said he believes the same, but I\u2019ve long wondered how, exactly, society is going to enjoy all this upside if regulators don\u2019t get more involved in the trajectory of these companies. After all, I told Khosla on stage, we\u2019ve already seen a massive aggregation of wealth and power tied to a smaller and smaller group of companies and individuals. When will enough be enough?\n\nHere, Khosla said the issue bothers him greatly. \u201cI think 25 years from now, when I hope I\u2019m still working . . . the need to work will mostly disappear.\u201d Still, while AI should create \u201cgreat abundance, great GDP growth, great productivity \u2013 all the things economists measure,\u201d he said, he worries \u201cmore than anything else\u201d about \u201cincreasing income disparity. How do we [ensure the] equitable distribution of the benefits of AI?\u201d\n\nHe has an inkling where the tipping point might be. \u201cIf [U.S] GDP growth goes from 2% today \u2013 it\u2019s less than 1% in Europe right now \u2013 to 4%, 5%, 6%, we\u2019ll have enough abundance to share the wealth and share the benefits.\u201d\n\nWhether and how that happens, of course, are even bigger questions, and for all his brilliance, Khosla, a self-described techno optimist, didn\u2019t have the answers.\n\nInstead, after one last closing remark, he thanked the crowd for their time, stood up, and walked off stage, where a dozen young founders were gathered in the wings, all of them hoping to bend his ear for as long as they could.", "authors": "['Connie Loizos']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/53800655026_a615ec2ef8_k.jpg?resize=1200,800", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

But they have to look at where the models are going next year and five years from now, and say, \u2018We want to leverage that capability.\u2019\n\nWe also talked about regulation. I observed that Khosla has said before that closed large language models like that of OpenAI should be safeguarded, even while there should be a regulatory framework around them. I wondered if that means that Khosla will forever forswear other, \u201copen source\u201d AI.\n\nNot at all, he said, noting that he\u2019s a \u201chuge fan\u201d of open source. Sun was one of the first companies to \u201cjump on open source,\u201d opening sourcing its file system, he said. He also noted that Khosla Ventures was the earliest investor in GitLab, whose software invites people to work on code jointly.\n\nBut he suggested that open source in the context of large language models is a different animal altogether. The \u201clargest risk we face with AI is China\u201d and \u201cpowerful Chinese AI\u201d that competes with the \u201cliberal values\u201d of the U.S., he said, adding that \u201cwe need to make sure that China stays behind us.\u201d Otherwise, he warned, it will be China providing the \u201cfree doctors and free oncologists\u201d to the rest of the world and, while they are at it, they\u2019ll \u201cexport both the economic power that comes with AI and their political philosophy.\u201d\n\nOn stage, I mentioned to Khosla my recent sit-down with FTC Chair Lina Khan, who does not believe in the national champions model as a reason to coddle outfits like Google or OpenAI as they further their development of AI.\n\nKhan hears all the time from executives and investors who say that government intervention will put the U.S. on a dangerous path. But during my sit-down with her, she argued that time and again, the U.S. has chosen \u201cthe path of competition\u201d and it has \u201cended up fueling and catalyzing so many of these breakthrough innovations and so much of the remarkable growth that our country has enjoyed and that has allowed us to stay ahead globally.\u201d\n\nIf you look at some other countries that instead chose that national champions model,\u201d Khan added at the time, \u201cthey\u2019re the ones who got left behind.\u201d\n\nI had barely mentioned Khan, however, when Khosla became dismissive, calling her \u201cnot a rational human being\u201d and accusing her of not understanding business.\n\n\u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be in that role,\u201d said Khosla. \u201cAntitrust is a good thing to have in any country, any economic system. But antitrust [that\u2019s] over enforced or over executed is bad economic policy. One thing the US has over its European rivals is much more rational business environments. That\u2019s why the Europeans have regulated themselves out of leading in any technology area; they just basically have regulated themselves out of AI, out of all social media, out of all internet startups.\u201d\n\nOf course, if some antitrust enforcement is good, but too much is not good, the question is where to draw the line. On this point, before we parted ways, I brought up the \u201cabundance\u201d that Altman foresees created by AI. During one of TechCrunch\u2019s StrictlyVC events last year, Altman said that the \u201cgood case\u201d for AI is \u201cjust so unbelievably good that you sound like a really crazy person to start talking about it.\u201d\n\nKhosla has said he believes the same, but I\u2019ve long wondered how, exactly, society is going to enjoy all this upside if regulators don\u2019t get more involved in the trajectory of these companies. After all, I told Khosla on stage, we\u2019ve already seen a massive aggregation of wealth and power tied to a smaller and smaller group of companies and individuals. When will enough be enough?\n\nHere, Khosla said the issue bothers him greatly. \u201cI think 25 years from now, when I hope I\u2019m still working . . . the need to work will mostly disappear.\u201d Still, while AI should create \u201cgreat abundance, great GDP growth, great productivity \u2013 all the things economists measure,\u201d he said, he worries \u201cmore than anything else\u201d about \u201cincreasing income disparity. How do we [ensure the] equitable distribution of the benefits of AI?\u201d\n\nHe has an inkling where the tipping point might be. \u201cIf [U.S] GDP growth goes from 2% today \u2013 it\u2019s less than 1% in Europe right now \u2013 to 4%, 5%, 6%, we\u2019ll have enough abundance to share the wealth and share the benefits.\u201d\n\nWhether and how that happens, of course, are even bigger questions, and for all his brilliance, Khosla, a self-described techno optimist, didn\u2019t have the answers.\n\nInstead, after one last closing remark, he thanked the crowd for their time, stood up, and walked off stage, where a dozen young founders were gathered in the wings, all of them hoping to bend his ear for as long as they could.", "authors": "['Connie Loizos']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/53800655026_a615ec2ef8_k.jpg?resize=1200,800", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "Women in AI: Anika Collier Navaroli is working to shift the power imbalance", "text": "To give AI-focused women academics and others their well-deserved \u2014 and overdue \u2014 time in the spotlight, TechCrunch is launching a series of interviews focusing on remarkable women who\u2019ve contributed to the AI revolution.\n\nAnika Collier Navaroli is a senior fellow at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University and a Technology Public Voices Fellow with the OpEd Project, held in collaboration with the MacArthur Foundation.\n\nShe is known for her research and advocacy work within technology. Previously, she worked as a race and technology practitioner fellow at the Stanford Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society. Before this, she led Trust & Safety at Twitch and Twitter. Navaroli is perhaps best known for her congressional testimony about Twitter, where she spoke about the ignored warnings of impending violence on social media that prefaced what would become the January 6 Capitol attack.\n\nBriefly, how did you get your start in AI? What attracted you to the field?\n\nAbout 20 years ago, I was working as a copy clerk in the newsroom of my hometown paper during the summer when it went digital. Back then, I was an undergrad studying journalism. Social media sites like Facebook were sweeping over my campus, and I became obsessed with trying to understand how laws built on the printing press would evolve with emerging technologies. That curiosity led me through law school, where I migrated to Twitter, studied media law and policy, and I watched the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street movements play out. I put it all together and wrote my master\u2019s thesis about how new technology was transforming the way information flowed and how society exercised freedom of expression.\n\nI worked at a couple law firms after graduation and then found my way to Data & Society Research Institute leading the new think tank\u2019s research on what was then called \u201cbig data,\u201d civil rights, and fairness. My work there looked at how early AI systems like facial recognition software, predictive policing tools, and criminal justice risk assessment algorithms were replicating bias and creating unintended consequences that impacted marginalized communities. I then went on to work at Color of Change and lead the first civil rights audit of a tech company, develop the organization\u2019s playbook for tech accountability campaigns, and advocate for tech policy changes to governments and regulators. From there, I became a senior policy official inside Trust & Safety teams at Twitter and Twitch.\n\nWhat work are you most proud of in the AI field?\n\nI am the most proud of my work inside of technology companies using policy to practically shift the balance of power and correct bias within culture and knowledge-producing algorithmic systems. At Twitter, I ran a couple campaigns to verify individuals who shockingly had been previously excluded from the exclusive verification process, including Black women, people of color, and queer folks. This also included leading AI scholars like Safiya Noble, Alondra Nelson, Timnit Gebru, and Meredith Broussard. This was in 2020 when Twitter was still Twitter. Back then, verification meant that your name and content became a part of Twitter\u2019s core algorithm because tweets from verified accounts were injected into recommendations, search results, home timelines, and contributed toward the creation of trends. So working to verify new people with different perspectives on AI fundamentally shifted whose voices were given authority as thought leaders and elevated new ideas into the public conversation during some really critical moments.\n\nI\u2019m also very proud of the research I conducted at Stanford that came together as Black in Moderation. When I was working inside of tech companies, I also noticed that no one was really writing or talking about the experiences that I was having every day as a Black person working in Trust & Safety. So when I left the industry and went back into academia, I decided to speak with Black tech workers and bring to light their stories. The research ended up being the first of its kind and has spurred so many new and important conversations about the experiences of tech employees with marginalized identities.\n\nHow do you navigate the challenges of the male-dominated tech industry and, by extension, the male-dominated AI industry?\n\nAs a Black queer woman, navigating male-dominated spaces and spaces where I am othered has been a part of my entire life journey. Within tech and AI, I think the most challenging aspect has been what I call in my research \u201ccompelled identity labor.\u201d I coined the term to describe frequent situations where employees with marginalized identities are treated as the voices and/or representatives of entire communities who share their identities.\n\nBecause of the high stakes that come with developing new technology like AI, that labor can sometimes feel almost impossible to escape. I had to learn to set very specific boundaries for myself about what issues I was willing to engage with and when.\n\nWhat are some of the most pressing issues facing AI as it evolves?\n\nAccording to investigative reporting, current generative AI models have gobbled up all the data on the internet and will soon run out of available data to devour. So the largest AI companies in the world are turning to synthetic data, or information generated by AI itself, rather than humans, to continue to train their systems.\n\nThe idea took me down a rabbit hole. So, I recently wrote an Op-Ed arguing that I think this use of synthetic data as training data is one of the most pressing ethical issues facing new AI development. Generative AI systems have already shown that based on their original training data, their output is to replicate bias and create false information. So the pathway of training new systems with synthetic data would mean constantly feeding biased and inaccurate outputs back into the system as new training data. I described this as potentially devolving into a feedback loop to hell.\n\nSince I wrote the piece, Mark Zuckerberg lauded that Meta\u2019s updated Llama 3 chatbot was partially powered by synthetic data and was the \u201cmost intelligent\u201d generative AI product on the market.\n\nWhat are some issues AI users should be aware of?\n\nAI is such an omnipresent part of our present lives, from spellcheck and social media feeds to chatbots and image generators. In many ways, society has become the guinea pig for the experiments of this new, untested technology. But AI users shouldn\u2019t feel powerless.\n\nI\u2019ve been arguing that technology advocates should come together and organize AI users to call for a People Pause on AI. I think that the Writers Guild of America has shown that with organization, collective action, and patient resolve, people can come together to create meaningful boundaries for the use of AI technologies. I also believe that if we pause now to fix the mistakes of the past and create new ethical guidelines and regulation, AI doesn\u2019t have to become an existential threat to our futures.\n\nWhat is the best way to responsibly build AI?\n\nMy experience working inside of tech companies showed me how much it matters who is in the room writing policies, presenting arguments, and making decisions. My pathway also showed me that I developed the skills I needed to succeed within the technology industry by starting in journalism school. I\u2019m now back working at Columbia Journalism School and I am interested in training up the next generation of people who will do the work of technology accountability and responsibly developing AI both inside of tech companies and as external watchdogs.\n\nI think [journalism] school gives people such unique training in interrogating information, seeking truth, considering multiple viewpoints, creating logical arguments, and distilling facts and reality from opinion and misinformation. I believe that\u2019s a solid foundation for the people who will be responsible for writing the rules for what the next iterations of AI can and cannot do. And I\u2019m looking forward to creating a more paved pathway for those who come next.\n\nI also believe that in addition to skilled Trust & Safety workers, the AI industry needs external regulation. In the U.S., I argue that this should come in the form of a new agency to regulate American technology companies with the power to establish and enforce baseline safety and privacy standards. I\u2019d also like to continue to work to connect current and future regulators with former tech workers who can help those in power ask the right questions and create new nuanced and practical solutions.", "authors": "['Dominic-Madori Davis']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/women-in-ai-navaroli.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "Women in AI: Anika Collier Navaroli is working to shift the power imbalance", "text": "To give AI-focused women academics and others their well-deserved \u2014 and overdue \u2014 time in the spotlight, TechCrunch is launching a series of interviews focusing on remarkable women who\u2019ve contributed to the AI revolution.\n\nAnika Collier Navaroli is a senior fellow at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University and a Technology Public Voices Fellow with the OpEd Project, held in collaboration with the MacArthur Foundation.\n\nShe is known for her research and advocacy work within technology. Previously, she worked as a race and technology practitioner fellow at the Stanford Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society. Before this, she led Trust & Safety at Twitch and Twitter. Navaroli is perhaps best known for her congressional testimony about Twitter, where she spoke about the ignored warnings of impending violence on social media that prefaced what would become the January 6 Capitol attack.\n\nBriefly, how did you get your start in AI? What attracted you to the field?\n\nAbout 20 years ago, I was working as a copy clerk in the newsroom of my hometown paper during the summer when it went digital. Back then, I was an undergrad studying journalism. Social media sites like Facebook were sweeping over my campus, and I became obsessed with trying to understand how laws built on the printing press would evolve with emerging technologies. That curiosity led me through law school, where I migrated to Twitter, studied media law and policy, and I watched the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street movements play out. I put it all together and wrote my master\u2019s thesis about how new technology was transforming the way information flowed and how society exercised freedom of expression.\n\nI worked at a couple law firms after graduation and then found my way to Data & Society Research Institute leading the new think tank\u2019s research on what was then called \u201cbig data,\u201d civil rights, and fairness. My work there looked at how early AI systems like facial recognition software, predictive policing tools, and criminal justice risk assessment algorithms were replicating bias and creating unintended consequences that impacted marginalized communities. I then went on to work at Color of Change and lead the first civil rights audit of a tech company, develop the organization\u2019s playbook for tech accountability campaigns, and advocate for tech policy changes to governments and regulators. From there, I became a senior policy official inside Trust & Safety teams at Twitter and Twitch.\n\nWhat work are you most proud of in the AI field?\n\nI am the most proud of my work inside of technology companies using policy to practically shift the balance of power and correct bias within culture and knowledge-producing algorithmic systems. At Twitter, I ran a couple campaigns to verify individuals who shockingly had been previously excluded from the exclusive verification process, including Black women, people of color, and queer folks. This also included leading AI scholars like Safiya Noble, Alondra Nelson, Timnit Gebru, and Meredith Broussard. This was in 2020 when Twitter was still Twitter. Back then, verification meant that your name and content became a part of Twitter\u2019s core algorithm because tweets from verified accounts were injected into recommendations, search results, home timelines, and contributed toward the creation of trends. So working to verify new people with different perspectives on AI fundamentally shifted whose voices were given authority as thought leaders and elevated new ideas into the public conversation during some really critical moments.\n\nI\u2019m also very proud of the research I conducted at Stanford that came together as Black in Moderation. When I was working inside of tech companies, I also noticed that no one was really writing or talking about the experiences that I was having every day as a Black person working in Trust & Safety. So when I left the industry and went back into academia, I decided to speak with Black tech workers and bring to light their stories. The research ended up being the first of its kind and has spurred so many new and important conversations about the experiences of tech employees with marginalized identities.\n\nHow do you navigate the challenges of the male-dominated tech industry and, by extension, the male-dominated AI industry?\n\nAs a Black queer woman, navigating male-dominated spaces and spaces where I am othered has been a part of my entire life journey. Within tech and AI, I think the most challenging aspect has been what I call in my research \u201ccompelled identity labor.\u201d I coined the term to describe frequent situations where employees with marginalized identities are treated as the voices and/or representatives of entire communities who share their identities.\n\nBecause of the high stakes that come with developing new technology like AI, that labor can sometimes feel almost impossible to escape. I had to learn to set very specific boundaries for myself about what issues I was willing to engage with and when.\n\nWhat are some of the most pressing issues facing AI as it evolves?\n\nAccording to investigative reporting, current generative AI models have gobbled up all the data on the internet and will soon run out of available data to devour. So the largest AI companies in the world are turning to synthetic data, or information generated by AI itself, rather than humans, to continue to train their systems.\n\nThe idea took me down a rabbit hole. So, I recently wrote an Op-Ed arguing that I think this use of synthetic data as training data is one of the most pressing ethical issues facing new AI development. Generative AI systems have already shown that based on their original training data, their output is to replicate bias and create false information. So the pathway of training new systems with synthetic data would mean constantly feeding biased and inaccurate outputs back into the system as new training data. I described this as potentially devolving into a feedback loop to hell.\n\nSince I wrote the piece, Mark Zuckerberg lauded that Meta\u2019s updated Llama 3 chatbot was partially powered by synthetic data and was the \u201cmost intelligent\u201d generative AI product on the market.\n\nWhat are some issues AI users should be aware of?\n\nAI is such an omnipresent part of our present lives, from spellcheck and social media feeds to chatbots and image generators. In many ways, society has become the guinea pig for the experiments of this new, untested technology. But AI users shouldn\u2019t feel powerless.\n\nI\u2019ve been arguing that technology advocates should come together and organize AI users to call for a People Pause on AI. I think that the Writers Guild of America has shown that with organization, collective action, and patient resolve, people can come together to create meaningful boundaries for the use of AI technologies. I also believe that if we pause now to fix the mistakes of the past and create new ethical guidelines and regulation, AI doesn\u2019t have to become an existential threat to our futures.\n\nWhat is the best way to responsibly build AI?\n\nMy experience working inside of tech companies showed me how much it matters who is in the room writing policies, presenting arguments, and making decisions. My pathway also showed me that I developed the skills I needed to succeed within the technology industry by starting in journalism school. I\u2019m now back working at Columbia Journalism School and I am interested in training up the next generation of people who will do the work of technology accountability and responsibly developing AI both inside of tech companies and as external watchdogs.\n\nI think [journalism] school gives people such unique training in interrogating information, seeking truth, considering multiple viewpoints, creating logical arguments, and distilling facts and reality from opinion and misinformation. I believe that\u2019s a solid foundation for the people who will be responsible for writing the rules for what the next iterations of AI can and cannot do. And I\u2019m looking forward to creating a more paved pathway for those who come next.\n\nI also believe that in addition to skilled Trust & Safety workers, the AI industry needs external regulation. In the U.S., I argue that this should come in the form of a new agency to regulate American technology companies with the power to establish and enforce baseline safety and privacy standards. I\u2019d also like to continue to work to connect current and future regulators with former tech workers who can help those in power ask the right questions and create new nuanced and practical solutions.", "authors": "['Dominic-Madori Davis']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/women-in-ai-navaroli.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "The EU Digital Identity Wallet: Everything you need to know about the EU\u2019s plans for a universal digital identity system", "text": "The EU Digital Identity Wallet is an ambitious project by the European Union that\u2019s still a bit under the radar but worth paying attention to, as it could deliver big things in the next few years.\n\nThe goal is to set up a universal digital identity system for citizens. If all goes to plan, Europeans will be able to download and use a free EU Digital Identity Wallet to access a wide range of public and private services, relying on identity verification and authentication of other credentials stored in an app on their smartphone.\n\nFollowing recent adoption of a key legal framework, EU countries are expected to issue the first of EU Digital Identity Wallets by the end of 2026. Unlike current national e-ID schemes, the future Pan-EU wallets will be recognized by all member states.\n\nWhile national e-ID systems have been available in some European countries for many years \u2014 Estonia is a particular pioneer in digital identity \u2014 regional lawmakers have, since 2021, set themselves the goal of creating conditions for a digital identity system that works across the bloc\u2019s single market.\n\nSo while there won\u2019t be a single, universal EU wallet app for everyone to use, the goal is to establish a system where different wallet apps will work anywhere in the EU, aligning with the bloc\u2019s Digital Single Market mission.\n\nAn EU digital ID wallet for everything?\n\nOne obvious motivation for setting up the EU Digital Identity Wallet is convenience.\n\nEuropeans will be able to download a wallet app to their smartphone or device and use it to store and selectively share key credentials when they need to do things like verify their identity or prove their age. The wallet will work both for ID checks online and in the real world. It\u2019s also intended as a digital repository for official documents, such as a driver\u2019s license, medical prescriptions, educational qualifications, passports, etc. E-signing functionality will also be supported.\n\nSo less hassle managing different bits of paper, or even remembering where you put your bank cards, is the general idea.\n\nBut there are other more strategic motivating factors in play. The bloc has woken up to the value of data in our fast-accelerating AI age. Policies that remove friction and grease the flow of information \u2014 or at least try to when it comes to getting citizens to share personal data to do things like sign up for new services or to transact \u2014 fit the political game plan.\n\nThe EU has an extensive and growing body of digital regulation. A Pan-EU e-ID would clearly come in very handy here. For example, aspects of the online governance regime established by the Digital Services Act (DSA) could be easier to implement once the EU can point to having a \u201cuniversal, secure and trustworthy\u201d digital ID system in place, as the EU Digital Identity Wallet is being billed. Think privacy-preserving access to adult content websites for people who could use the digital ID to verify they\u2019re over 18, for example.\n\nAnother big EU digital policy push in recent years aims to remove barriers to the sharing and reuse of data, including across internal borders, by setting up infrastructure and rules for so-called Common European Data Spaces. Again, a universal EU digital ID that promises citizens privacy and autonomy could make Europeans more comfortable doing more info-sharing \u2014 helping data flow into these strategic spaces.\n\nInterestingly, though, the EU\u2019s president, Ursula von der Leyen, opted for a very different framing for the opportunity for the wallet when announcing the plan in her September 2020 State of the Union address, pointing to growing privacy risks for citizens who are constantly being asked to share data in order to access online services. The wallet responds to this concern because a core feature is support for selective data sharing. So in addition to an EU pledge that use of the wallet will remain voluntary for citizens, the main pitch to users is that it\u2019s \u201cprivacy-preserving\u201d as they get to remain in control: selecting which data they share with whom.\n\nHaving a privacy-preserving approach could help the EU unlock finer-grained digital regulation opportunities, too, though. As noted above, it could give citizens a means to share their verified age but not their identity, allowing a wallet app user to sign into an age-restricted service anonymously. The EU wants the wallets to support wider governance goals under the DSA, which look set to usher in harder age verification requirements for services with content that might be inappropriate for kids \u2014 that is, once the appropriate \u201cprivacy preserving\u201d tech exists.\n\nOther use cases for the wallet that the EU has discussed include an apartment-rental scenario where a citizen could share a bunch of verified intel about their rental history with a potential landlord without having to confirm their identity unless/until they get to sign the contract. Or someone with multiple bank accounts around the Union could use it to simplify transaction authorizations.\n\nOnline services will be obliged to accept the Pan-EU credential. So it\u2019s also being pitched as a European alternative to existing (commercial) digital identity offerings, such as the \u201csign in with\u201d credentials offered by Big Tech players, like Apple and Google.\n\nChallenging Big Tech\u2019s grip on data\n\nHere the bloc\u2019s lawmakers look to be responding to concerns about how much power has been ceded to platform giants on account of the key digital infrastructure they own and operate.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise the EU Digital Identity Wallet proposal was adopted by the Commission in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, when apps that could display a person\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination status were on everyone\u2019s mind. But the public health crisis also starkly underscored an asymmetrical power dynamic between lawmakers and the commercial giants controlling mainstream mobile technology infrastructure. (Apple and Google literally set rules on how COVID-19 exposure notification data could be exchanged, with their technical choices overriding governments\u2019 directly stated preferences in several cases.)\n\nBeyond considerations of strategic digital sovereignty, a universal e-ID wallet concept ties tightly to the EU\u2019s general push to amp up digitalization as a flywheel for better economic fortunes. Assuming the system is well-executed and reliable, and the wallets themselves are user friendly and easy to use, a universal EU ID could boost productivity by increasing efficiency and uptake of online services.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s a big \u201cif\u201d; there are sizable technical challenges to delivering on the EU vision for the universal ID system.\n\nSecurity and privacy are obviously essential pieces of the puzzle. The first is fundamental for any identity and authentication system to fly. The second comprises the bloc\u2019s main pitch to citizens who will need to be persuaded to adopt the wallets if the whole project isn\u2019t to end up an expensive white elephant.\n\nPoor implementation is a clear risk. Low uptake of flaky national e-ID scheme shows what could go wrong. Wallet apps will need to be slick and easy to use across the full sweep of planned use cases, as well as having robust security and privacy \u2014 which demands a whole ecosystem of players get behind the project \u2014 or users simply won\u2019t get on board.\n\nRemember, competition on digital identity is coming from already baked-in mainstream platform offerings, like \u201cSign in with Google.\u201d And, sadly, convenience and ease-of-use still often trump privacy concerns in the online arena.\n\nPrivacy could also create barriers to adoption. After the proposal was unveiled, there were some reservations expressed about the EU setting up a universal ID infrastructure, with some commentators invoking the risk of function-creep toward a China-style social control. Having a credible technical architecture that both secures and firewalls citizens\u2019 data will therefore be critical to success.\n\nUniversal availability by 2030\n\nGetting the EU Digital Identity Wallet system off the ground has already involved years of preparatory work, but there\u2019s plenty more testing, standard setting and implementation ahead.\n\nSo far the bloc has put in place a legal framework for interoperable EU wallets (i.e., the Digital Identity Regulation, which entered into force in May this year). Work on the development of a secure technical architecture, common standards and specifications is ongoing, but a common EU Toolbox has been established. The Commission has also published an architecture reference on GitHub. Code is being open sourced, and the EU intends ecosystem infrastructure to be based on common standards to drive trust and adoption.\n\nThe bloc is also engaged with industry and public sector stakeholders on large-scale pilots to test the proposed technical specifications.\n\nMore paving needs to be laid in the coming years, including through a series of implementing acts affirming critical technical details. Plenty could still go wrong. But the EU has at least given itself a fairly generous lead-in to get this one right. So while the first wallets are supposed to be coming online in a couple years\u2019 time, the bloc is not expecting universal system access for its circa 450 million citizens until 2030.", "authors": "['Natasha Lomas']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1150039017.jpg?resize=1200,660", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "How 2 high school teens raised a $500K seed round for their API startup (yes, it\u2019s AI)", "text": "Just a few weeks ago, 18-year-old best friends Christopher Fitzgerald and Nicholas Van Landschoot graduated from high school.\n\nWhile most teens their age would be living it up in their last summer before college or the adult jobs that await them, Fitzgerald and Van Landschoot are hunkered down in a VC office in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nThey\u2019re spending the summer working on their startup APIGen after they raised a $500,000 pre-seed investment from Varana Capital. Fitzgerald will head off to Penn State in the fall and Van Landschoot will move near the university but is putting his college plans on hold to be a full-time startup founder.\n\nThe money was raised while they were still in high school after a prototype for their idea garnered a lot of interest among the large Boulder community of AI enthusiasts.\n\nAPIGen is working on a platform that will build custom APIs from natural language prompts. It will be able to, for instance, allow an e-commerce business to simply ask for an API that connects its web front end to its database, and the platform will deliver it.\n\nBy API, the founders don\u2019t just mean a standard \u201capplication programming interface\u201d that allows applications to exchange data or perform some other simple workflow function. They want APIGen to create complex custom APIs that can do multiple or serial tasks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually generating the code for the APIs so that you can have business logic, actual custom functionalities within those APIs as well,\u201d Van Landschoot told TechCrunch.\n\nIn addition to web apps and databases, Fitzgerald says IoT devices are one of his startup\u2019s target areas. He offers the example of a customer asking for an API that instructs a drone to fly around the perimeter of an area, capture images and allow another application to interface with the result. Another example is an API that uses face recognition for building security. Once a database of photos of verified employee faces is created, the user could ask APIGen for an API that lets a smartlock\u2019s door camera check the face of everyone who arrives against that database before unlocking the door.\n\n\u201cAPIs at the end of the day, can be as simple or as complex as you make them to be,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cThey can range from just new connectors that take one entry of data, one row of data from a table of a database, to entire back ends. And that\u2019s really what we\u2019re trying to target there, for entire web apps for entire IoT applications.\u201d\n\nThe teens met on their school\u2019s debate team and bonded over their love of coding. Their first project together was a chatbot that would allow people to chat with data. They soon realized that it wasn\u2019t an original idea. Still, while building that app, they learned that their tech relied on APIs and that \u201cmaking APIs was kind of a pain,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cThey were hard to design.\u201d\n\nSo they focused on that.

{"title": "How 2 high school teens raised a $500K seed round for their API startup (yes, it\u2019s AI)", "text": "Just a few weeks ago, 18-year-old best friends Christopher Fitzgerald and Nicholas Van Landschoot graduated from high school.\n\nWhile most teens their age would be living it up in their last summer before college or the adult jobs that await them, Fitzgerald and Van Landschoot are hunkered down in a VC office in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nThey\u2019re spending the summer working on their startup APIGen after they raised a $500,000 pre-seed investment from Varana Capital. Fitzgerald will head off to Penn State in the fall and Van Landschoot will move near the university but is putting his college plans on hold to be a full-time startup founder.\n\nThe money was raised while they were still in high school after a prototype for their idea garnered a lot of interest among the large Boulder community of AI enthusiasts.\n\nAPIGen is working on a platform that will build custom APIs from natural language prompts. It will be able to, for instance, allow an e-commerce business to simply ask for an API that connects its web front end to its database, and the platform will deliver it.\n\nBy API, the founders don\u2019t just mean a standard \u201capplication programming interface\u201d that allows applications to exchange data or perform some other simple workflow function. They want APIGen to create complex custom APIs that can do multiple or serial tasks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually generating the code for the APIs so that you can have business logic, actual custom functionalities within those APIs as well,\u201d Van Landschoot told TechCrunch.\n\nIn addition to web apps and databases, Fitzgerald says IoT devices are one of his startup\u2019s target areas. He offers the example of a customer asking for an API that instructs a drone to fly around the perimeter of an area, capture images and allow another application to interface with the result. Another example is an API that uses face recognition for building security. Once a database of photos of verified employee faces is created, the user could ask APIGen for an API that lets a smartlock\u2019s door camera check the face of everyone who arrives against that database before unlocking the door.\n\n\u201cAPIs at the end of the day, can be as simple or as complex as you make them to be,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cThey can range from just new connectors that take one entry of data, one row of data from a table of a database, to entire back ends. And that\u2019s really what we\u2019re trying to target there, for entire web apps for entire IoT applications.\u201d\n\nThe teens met on their school\u2019s debate team and bonded over their love of coding. Their first project together was a chatbot that would allow people to chat with data. They soon realized that it wasn\u2019t an original idea. Still, while building that app, they learned that their tech relied on APIs and that \u201cmaking APIs was kind of a pain,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cThey were hard to design.\u201d\n\nSo they focused on that. Once they crafted an alpha version of their idea, a demo-level tool, they began to show it around to the programmers in their circle to get feedback. They knew people in their local tech industry. Van Landschoot\u2019s dad works in cybersecurity IT, and Fitzgerald landed a summer internship as a programmer at SoftBank through a connection with a friend\u2019s dad.\n\nAnd then they started sending cold messages to VCs on LinkedIn and to anyone else they thought might respond.\n\n\u201cWe asked people to destroy this pitch deck,\u201d Fitzgerald said.\n\nPhil Broenniman (left), Ankur Ahuja (right), Varana Capital Image Credits: Varana Capital\n\nA VC is so impressed, he offers to invest\n\nOne of the people who got the message \u2014 and had heard about the founders through other connections in Denver/Boulder\u2019s tight-knit startup community \u2014 was Philip Broenniman, founder of Denver\u2019s Varana Capital.

But since Elon Musk\u2019s hostile takeover, that checkmark now means that a user has paid at least $8 per month for a premium subscription that gets them access to longer posts, fewer ads, better algorithmic consideration and Grok. And while X changed tack in April and gave the verification badge back to some users based on number of followers, the blue checkmark could also mean someone is a fan of Musk. Don\u2019t believe me?

A handful of TechCrunch journalists have also been impersonated on the platform. Some of the accounts, including my own fake one, have been suspended after being reported to X.

{"title": "OmniAI transforms business data for AI", "text": "The majority of companies struggle to extract value from their data. Several years ago, Forrester reported that between 60% and 73% of data belonging to the average business goes unused for analytics. That\u2019s because the data\u2019s siloed or otherwise pigeonholed by technical and security considerations, making it difficult \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 to apply analytical tools.\n\nAnna Pojawis and Tyler Maran, engineers who previously did stints at Y Combinator-backed startups Hightouch (a data-syncing platform) and Fair Square (a health insurance tool), were inspired to try their hands at solving the data value problem after discovering that many companies had been \u201clocked out\u201d of analytics strategies due to the engineering roadblocks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found that a significant part of the market, especially those in regulated industries like healthcare and finance,\u201d have struggled with data analytics, Maran told TechCrunch. \u201cThe majority of corporate data doesn\u2019t fit into a database today; it\u2019s sales calls, documents, Slack messages and so on. And, given the scale of these companies, off-the-shelf data models are typically not sufficient.\u201d\n\nSo Pojawis and Maran founded OmniAI, a set of tools that transform unstructured enterprise data into something that data analytics apps and AI can understand.\n\nImage Credits: OmniAI\n\nOmniAI syncs with a company\u2019s data storage services and databases (e.g., Snowflake, MongoDB, etc.), preps the data within and allows companies to run the model of their choice \u2014 for example, a large language model \u2014 on the data. OmniAI performs all of its work in the company\u2019s cloud, OmniAI\u2019s private cloud or on-premises environments, delivering ostensibly improved security, according to Maran.\n\n\u201cWe believe that large language models will become essential to a company\u2019s infrastructure in the next decade, and having everything hosted in one place just makes sense,\u201d Maran said.\n\nOut of the box, OmniAI offers integrations with models, including Meta\u2019s Llama 3, Anthropic\u2019s Claude, Mistral\u2019s Mistral Large and Amazon\u2019s AWS Titan for use cases like automatically redacting sensitive information from data and generally building AI-powered applications. Customers sign a software-as-a-service contract with OmniAI to enable management of models on their infrastructure.\n\nIt\u2019s early days. But Omni, which recently closed a $3.2 million seed round led by FundersClub at a $30 million valuation, claims to have 10 customers already, including Klaviyo and Carrefour. Annual recurring revenue is on track to reach $1 million by 2025, Maran said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re an incredibly lean team in a fast-growing industry,\u201d Maran said. \u201cOur bet is that, over time, companies will opt for running models alongside their existing infrastructure, and model providers will focus more on licensing model weights to existing cloud providers.\u201d", "authors": "['Kyle Wiggers']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1652364481.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "OmniAI transforms business data for AI", "text": "The majority of companies struggle to extract value from their data. Several years ago, Forrester reported that between 60% and 73% of data belonging to the average business goes unused for analytics. That\u2019s because the data\u2019s siloed or otherwise pigeonholed by technical and security considerations, making it difficult \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 to apply analytical tools.\n\nAnna Pojawis and Tyler Maran, engineers who previously did stints at Y Combinator-backed startups Hightouch (a data-syncing platform) and Fair Square (a health insurance tool), were inspired to try their hands at solving the data value problem after discovering that many companies had been \u201clocked out\u201d of analytics strategies due to the engineering roadblocks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found that a significant part of the market, especially those in regulated industries like healthcare and finance,\u201d have struggled with data analytics, Maran told TechCrunch. \u201cThe majority of corporate data doesn\u2019t fit into a database today; it\u2019s sales calls, documents, Slack messages and so on. And, given the scale of these companies, off-the-shelf data models are typically not sufficient.\u201d\n\nSo Pojawis and Maran founded OmniAI, a set of tools that transform unstructured enterprise data into something that data analytics apps and AI can understand.\n\nImage Credits: OmniAI\n\nOmniAI syncs with a company\u2019s data storage services and databases (e.g., Snowflake, MongoDB, etc.), preps the data within and allows companies to run the model of their choice \u2014 for example, a large language model \u2014 on the data. OmniAI performs all of its work in the company\u2019s cloud, OmniAI\u2019s private cloud or on-premises environments, delivering ostensibly improved security, according to Maran.\n\n\u201cWe believe that large language models will become essential to a company\u2019s infrastructure in the next decade, and having everything hosted in one place just makes sense,\u201d Maran said.\n\nOut of the box, OmniAI offers integrations with models, including Meta\u2019s Llama 3, Anthropic\u2019s Claude, Mistral\u2019s Mistral Large and Amazon\u2019s AWS Titan for use cases like automatically redacting sensitive information from data and generally building AI-powered applications. Customers sign a software-as-a-service contract with OmniAI to enable management of models on their infrastructure.\n\nIt\u2019s early days. But Omni, which recently closed a $3.2 million seed round led by FundersClub at a $30 million valuation, claims to have 10 customers already, including Klaviyo and Carrefour. Annual recurring revenue is on track to reach $1 million by 2025, Maran said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re an incredibly lean team in a fast-growing industry,\u201d Maran said. \u201cOur bet is that, over time, companies will opt for running models alongside their existing infrastructure, and model providers will focus more on licensing model weights to existing cloud providers.\u201d", "authors": "['Kyle Wiggers']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1652364481.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "Women in AI: Charlette N\u2019Guessan is tackling data scarcity on the African continent", "text": "To give AI-focused women academics and others their well-deserved \u2014 and overdue \u2014 time in the spotlight, TechCrunch is launching a series of interviews focusing on remarkable women who\u2019ve contributed to the AI revolution.\n\nCharlette N\u2019Guessan is the Data Solutions and Ecosystem Lead at Amini, a deep tech startup leveraging space technology and artificial intelligence to tackle environmental data scarcity in Africa and the global South.\n\nShe co-founded and led the product development of Bace API, a secure identity verification system utilizing AI-powered facial recognition technology to combat online identity fraud and address facial recognition biases within the African context. She\u2019s also an AI expert consultant at the African Union High Level Panel on Emerging Technologies and works on the AU-AI continental Strategy titled \u201cHarnessing Artificial Intelligence for Africa\u2019s Socio-Economic Development\u201d with a focus on shaping the AI governance landscape in Africa.\n\nN\u2019Guessan has also co-authored several publications and is the first woman recipient of the Africa Prize for Engineering Innovation awarded by the Royal Academy of Engineering.\n\nBriefly, how did you get your start in AI? What attracted you to the field?\n\nI have an engineering background from a formal and informal education. I have always been passionate about the use of technology to build solutions that would positively impact my communities. This ambition led me to relocate to Ghana in 2017, where I aimed to learn from the anglophone market and kickstart my tech entrepreneurial journey.\n\nIn the development process of my startup, my former co-founders and I conducted market research to identify challenges in the financial sector, resulting in online identity fraud. We then decided to build a secure, reliable, and effective solution for financial institutions to bridge the gap in serving the unbanked populations in remote areas and establish online trust. This led to a software solution leveraging facial recognition and AI technologies, tailored to facilitate organizations in processing online client ID verification while ensuring our model was trained with representative data from the African market. This marked my initial involvement in the AI industry. Note that in 2023, despite our efforts, we encountered various challenges that led us to stop commercializing our product on the market. However, this experience fueled my determination to continue working in the AI field.\n\nWhat attracted me to AI was the realization of its immense power as a tool for solving societal problems. Once you grasp the technology, you can see its potential to address a wide range of issues. This understanding fueled my passion for AI and continues to drive my work in the field today.\n\nWhat work are you most proud of in the AI field?\n\nI am incredibly proud of my journey as a deep tech entrepreneur. Building an AI-driven startup in Africa isn\u2019t easy, so for those who have embarked on this journey, it\u2019s a significant achievement. This experience has been a major milestone in my professional career, and I am grateful for the challenges and opportunities it has brought.\n\nCurrently, I am proud of the work we do at Amini, where we are tackling the challenge of data scarcity on the African continent. Having faced this issue as a former founder myself, I am very grateful to work with inspiring and talented problem solvers. Today, my team and I have developed a solution by building a data infrastructure using space technology and AI to make data accessible and comprehensible. Our work is a game-changer and a crucial starting point for more data-driven products to emerge in the African market.\n\nHow do you navigate the challenges of the male-dominated tech industry and, by extension, the male-dominated AI industry?\n\nTruth is, what we are facing today in the industry has been shaped by societal biases and gender stereotypes. This is a societal mindset that has been nurtured for years. Most of the women working in the AI industry have been told at least once that they were in the wrong industry because they were expected to be A, B, C and D.\n\nWhy should we have to choose? Why should society dictate our paths for us? It\u2019s important to remind ourselves that women have made remarkable contributions to science, leading to some of the most impactful technological advancements that society is benefiting today. They exemplify what women can achieve when provided with education and resources.\n\nI am aware that it takes time to change a mindset, but we can\u2019t wait; we need to continue encouraging girls to study science and embrace careers in AI. Honestly, I\u2019ve seen progress compared to previous years, which gives me hope. I believe that ensuring equal opportunities in the industry will attract more women to AI roles, and providing more access to leadership positions for women will accelerate change toward gender balance in male-dominated industries.\n\nWhat advice would you give to women seeking to enter the AI field?\n\nFocus on your learning and ensure you acquire the skills needed in the AI field. Understand that the industry may expect you to demonstrate your capabilities more intensely compared to your male fellows. Honestly, investing in your skills is crucial and serves as a solid foundation. I believe this will not only boost your confidence in seizing opportunities but also enhance your resilience and professional growth.\n\nWhat are some of the most pressing issues facing AI as it evolves?\n\nSome of the most pressing issues facing AI as it evolves include challenges in articulating its short-term and long-term impacts on humans. This is currently a global conversation due to uncertainty surrounding emerging technologies. While we have witnessed impressive applications of AI in industries globally, including in Africa, particularly with the recent advancements in generative AI solutions and the capability of AI models to process vast volumes of data with minimal latency, we have also observed AI models riddled with various biases and hallucinations. The world is undeniably moving toward a more AI-driven future. However, several questions remain unanswered and need to be addressed:\n\nWhat is the future of humans in the AI loop?\n\nWhat is the appropriate approach for regulators to define policies and laws to mitigate risks in AI models?\n\nWhat does AI responsibility and ethical framework mean?\n\nWho should be held accountable for the outcomes of AI models?\n\nWhat are some issues AI users should be aware of?\n\nI like to remind people that we are all first AI users before any other title. Each of us interacts with AI solutions in various ways, whether it\u2019s directly or through our people (such as family members, friends, etc.) using various devices. That\u2019s why it is important to have an understanding of the technology itself. One of the things you should know is that most AI solutions on the market require your data, and as a user, be curious to understand the extent of control you give the machine over your data. When considering consuming an AI solution, consider data privacy and the security offered by the platform. This is crucial for your protection.\n\nAdditionally, there has been a lot of excitement about generative AI content. However, it\u2019s essential to be cautious about what you generate with these tools and to discern between content that is real and that which is false. For instance, social media users have faced the spread of deepfake-generated content, which serves as an example of how people with malicious intentions can misuse these tools. Always verify the source of generated content before sharing it, to avoid contributing to the problem.\n\nLastly, AI users should be mindful of becoming overly dependent on these tools. Some individuals may become addicted, and we\u2019ve seen instances where users have taken negative actions based on recommendations from AI chats. It\u2019s important to remember that AI models can produce inaccurate outcomes due to societal biases or other factors. In the long-term, users should strive to maintain independence to prevent potential mental health issues arising from unethical AI tools.\n\nWhat is the best way to responsibility build AI?\n\nThis is an interesting topic. I have been working with the High Panel on Emerging Technologies of the African Union as an AI expert consultant, focusing on drafting the AU-AI continental strategy with stakeholders from various backgrounds and countries involved. The goal of this strategy is to guide AU member states to recognize the value of AI for economic growth and develop a framework that supports the development of AI solutions while protecting Africans. Some key principles I always advise considering when building responsible AI for the African market are as follows:\n\nContext matters : Ensure your models are diverse and inclusive to address societal discrimination based on gender, regions, race, age, etc.\n\n: Ensure your models are diverse and inclusive to address societal discrimination based on gender, regions, race, age, etc. Accessibility : Is your solution accessible by your users?

However, one of the challenges is that many investors may lack knowledge and understanding about AI technology. What I have learned is that AI-driven products don\u2019t undergo the same investment risk assessment as other technological products on the market.\n\nTo address this challenge, investors should look beyond trends and deeply evaluate the solution at both the technical and impact levels. This could involve working with industry experts to gain a better understanding of the technical aspects of the AI solution and its potential impact at the short- and long-term.", "authors": "['Dominic-Madori Davis']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/women-in-ai-nguessan.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

#https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/22/whats-in-it-for-us-journalists-ask-as-publications-sign-content-deals-with-openai/
{"title": "\u2018What\u2019s in it for us?\u2019 journalists ask as publications sign content deals with AI firms", "text": "Now writers are picking up the pace to put AI protections in contracts\n\nVox Media\u2019s president, Pam Wasserstein, sent her staff a Slack message and an email on May 29 detailing what the company\u2019s journalists say was shocking news: Vox had signed a content licensing deal with OpenAI.\n\nThe deal gives the AI company access to Vox\u2019s current content, as well as the entire archive of its journalistic work, to train ChatGPT and other models. Wasserstein sent the alerts just moments before Axios published an exclusive detailing the licensing and product deal, much to the surprise of her journalists.\n\nWriters at The Atlantic, which signed a similar deal with the Microsoft-backed AI giant, were also sent an email moments before the Axios piece went up.\n\n\u201cAtlantic staffers have largely learned of this agreement from outside sources, and both the company and OpenAI have refused to answer questions about the terms of the deal,\u201d reads a May 30 statement from The Atlantic Union.\n\nNone of the current or former journalists at either company who TechCrunch interviewed had any inkling that their work would be handed over to OpenAI. All of them are concerned that their employers are making short-sighted deals that will ultimately harm writers and journalism as a whole.\n\nBoth Vox Media \u2014 which includes The Verge, New York, Eater, The Cut and more publications \u2014 and The Atlantic have published pieces that are critical of OpenAI and generative AI. They have aired concerns about the environmental impact of the power needed to run large language models, the board upheavals at OpenAI, and the \u201cgeneral lack of trustworthiness\u201d in the company, said Amy McCarthy, a reporter at Eater and communications chair of Vox\u2019s union.\n\nVox did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSince the deals were announced, journalists at each publisher have wrangled meetings with business-side higher-ups to learn more about the agreements, looking for one crucial piece of information: What\u2019s in it for the journalists?\n\nA sense of urgency\n\nIn the face of an increasing number of AI media deals, news guilds are now notching up the pace of negotiations to put in place AI protections similar to the ones Hollywood writing teams fought for.\n\n\u201cThe Writers Guild and Vox Media Union are firmly of the opinion that implementation of AI is a mandatory subject of bargaining, even though our contracts may not explicitly have AI provisions,\u201d McCarthy told TechCrunch. \u201cWe do have provisions in our contract that essentially mean that the company has to bargain with us over fundamental changes to our working conditions, and we very much believe this is a workplace issue, that it\u2019s a working conditions issue, and that the company is obligated to bargain with us about how this will work.\u201d\n\nThis means publishers that strike deals with AI providers might be contractually required to engage in discussions and negotiations with unions about these changes.\n\nThe Atlantic Media Union had also intended to bring this issue to the bargaining table, but the OpenAI deal adds a sense of urgency, one current employee told TechCrunch, requesting anonymity.\n\nDuring negotiations this month, The Atlantic\u2019s union put forward a proposal, per which AI wouldn\u2019t be used to replace writing, fact-checking, copy editing and illustration. It also proposed that writers can use AI at their discretion, in accordance with journalistic principles and ethics, but they can\u2019t be made to use it. That proposal is yet to be accepted.\n\nOther unions are working to put in similar protections. Nebraska journalists at the Omaha World-Herald Guild secured protections from AI earlier this year. In 2023, after CNET published a series of AI-generated articles, journalists at the publication went public with their union drive, demanding AI protections and a say in how AI is implemented in employee workflows.\n\nMaking companies include such safeguards in journalists\u2019 contracts is vital, because protection from the law isn\u2019t guaranteed. Companies like OpenAI contend that they\u2019re not breaking copyright laws by scraping what they say is publicly available content. They also say their chatbots don\u2019t reproduce the material in its entirety.\n\nBut publications like The New York Times, Raw Story, AlterNet and The Intercept have all sued OpenAI for using copyrighted works by journalists to train ChatGPT without properly crediting or citing the sources. Novelists, computer programmers and other groups have also filed copyright suits against OpenAI and other companies building generative AI.\n\nRichard Tofel, former president of nonprofit newsroom ProPublica and a consultant to news outlets, thinks these lawsuits will end up in the Supreme Court. If the courts rule that OpenAI and others are guilty of copyright infringement, \u201cthey\u2019ll need to make a deal with everybody.\u201d\n\nTofel thinks most publishers will end up making deals with AI companies. He noted that Google also faced similar copyright suits back when its search product was taking off, but by the time those were settled, users were so dependent on search that no publisher wanted to keep its content out of it.\n\nMcCarthy says writers can\u2019t rely only on the courts: \u201cWe have to look at every potential avenue as a way to push back against AI implementation.\u201d\n\nAnother concern for journalists is the adoption of AI by publishers for writing content, which some media outlets have already begun experimenting with.\n\nCNET and Gannett have published AI-generated stories and art, and in the case of Sports Illustrated, under fabricated bylines. Those stories were called out as AI-generated mainly because they were riddled with factual errors, but if AI gets a free pass to train on good journalism, those obvious errors may decrease over time.\n\nIf journalists won\u2019t question this, who will?\n\nJournalists understand the basic structure of the deals, but they still have questions.\n\nThe Atlantic\u2019s VP of communications, Anna Bross, said the company\u2019s partnership positions it as a premium news source within OpenAI, similar to other publishers\u2019 deals.\n\n\u201cThe Atlantic\u2019s articles will be discoverable within OpenAI\u2019s products, including ChatGPT, and as a partner, The Atlantic will help to shape how news is surfaced and presented in future real-time discovery products,\u201d Bross told TechCrunch. \u201cThe deal ensures guardrails and protections around how our content does appear within OpenAI\u2019s products. \u2026 If an Atlantic article is surfaced in response to a query, there will be Atlantic branding and a link back to the article on our site.\u201d\n\nBross noted that this is not a syndication license, meaning that OpenAI doesn\u2019t have permission to reproduce The Atlantic\u2019s articles or create similar reproductions of whole articles or lengthy excerpts.\n\nHowever, Atlantic journalists are still waiting on their leadership to explain why such content doesn\u2019t qualify as derivative work, which they would have the chance of being paid directly for. The Atlantic recently launched a new line of paperback books with the collected works of its writers, and it compensated the writers for those works, multiple sources told TechCrunch.\n\nBross noted that The Atlantic\u2019s contract with OpenAI protects against the creation of a derivative work.\n\nThe Atlantic\u2019s editorial staff brought up that topic at an all-hands meeting in mid-June, headed by the publication\u2019s CEO Nick Thompson, and they learned that while ChatGPT will be getting access to their work, the edit team is otherwise \u201cfairly insulated from it.\u201d\n\nIn other words, there\u2019s not an immediate threat of ChatGPT being used to write articles.\n\nThe financial terms of The Atlantic and Vox deals still elude journalists inside and outside the publications, but we know that The Atlantic\u2019s is a two-year contract, and that both will include the use of OpenAI technology for building products and features. OpenAI says that its tech will not be used to mimic writers\u2019 own voices.\n\nNews Corp, The Wall Street Journal\u2019s parent company, has also signed a deal with OpenAI that\u2019s reportedly worth more than $250 million over five years. Axel Springer, which runs Politico and Business Insider, has also joined hands with OpenAI in a deal reportedly worth tens of millions of euros.\n\nOther media outlets that have already signed similar partnerships with OpenAI include Dotdash Meredith (publisher of People, Better Homes & Gardens, Allrecipes, Investopedia and more), The Associated Press, The Financial Times, Le Monde in France, and Prisa Media in Spain.\n\n(We should also note that TechCrunch\u2019s parent company, Yahoo, is also dabbling with AI via the Yahoo News app. It\u2019s powered by the underlying code of the app Artifact, which Yahoo acquired in April.)\n\nOpenAI claims its agreements will help journalists by driving traffic back to their articles, but that remains to be seen as the implementations aren\u2019t yet live.\n\nTofel said that if users can ask an AI chatbot for the latest on the Israel-Hamas war, for example, it would present \u201cthe ultimate nightmare for the news companies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey could be very significantly disintermediated by an AI news product,\u201d he said.\n\nOpenAI was not able to confirm specifics about the user experience design, which could determine how likely a reader is to click an external link to an article.\n\nAnd if readers don\u2019t have to go to a publisher\u2019s website to read articles, its ad revenue will suffer \u2014 that\u2019s something the news industry is already struggling with as Google and Meta have deprioritized news in their algorithms. Journalists and writers will have a smaller audience for their work as well.\n\nJournalism is suffering from a lack of funding, mostly because tech giants like Meta and Google today rake in the lion\u2019s share of digital ad revenue. Publishers will no doubt welcome a new revenue stream to augment their balance sheets.\n\nBut journalists are questioning whether this is the best way forward.\n\n\u201cIt feels very much like a protection racket,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cLike we made a deal with the guy who just robbed our house, and he\u2019s pinky promising that he won\u2019t rob the house.\u201d\n\nSome AI startups are already lifting content without striking any deals. For example, ChatGPT rival Perplexity is under fire from Forbes for plagiarism, and Wired recently found that the AI company was surreptitiously scraping its website. Despite these claims, Perplexity is gearing up to announce ad revenue sharing deals with publishers next week, the startup told TechCrunch.\n\nStill, it looks like we can expect more deals like these in the future as publishers are all looking like they\u2019ll come to the same conclusion: AI\u2019s gonna steal our work anyway.

{"title": "\u2018What\u2019s in it for us?\u2019 journalists ask as publications sign content deals with AI firms", "text": "Now writers are picking up the pace to put AI protections in contracts\n\nVox Media\u2019s president, Pam Wasserstein, sent her staff a Slack message and an email on May 29 detailing what the company\u2019s journalists say was shocking news: Vox had signed a content licensing deal with OpenAI.\n\nThe deal gives the AI company access to Vox\u2019s current content, as well as the entire archive of its journalistic work, to train ChatGPT and other models. Wasserstein sent the alerts just moments before Axios published an exclusive detailing the licensing and product deal, much to the surprise of her journalists.\n\nWriters at The Atlantic, which signed a similar deal with the Microsoft-backed AI giant, were also sent an email moments before the Axios piece went up.\n\n\u201cAtlantic staffers have largely learned of this agreement from outside sources, and both the company and OpenAI have refused to answer questions about the terms of the deal,\u201d reads a May 30 statement from The Atlantic Union.\n\nNone of the current or former journalists at either company who TechCrunch interviewed had any inkling that their work would be handed over to OpenAI. All of them are concerned that their employers are making short-sighted deals that will ultimately harm writers and journalism as a whole.\n\nBoth Vox Media \u2014 which includes The Verge, New York, Eater, The Cut and more publications \u2014 and The Atlantic have published pieces that are critical of OpenAI and generative AI. They have aired concerns about the environmental impact of the power needed to run large language models, the board upheavals at OpenAI, and the \u201cgeneral lack of trustworthiness\u201d in the company, said Amy McCarthy, a reporter at Eater and communications chair of Vox\u2019s union.\n\nVox did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSince the deals were announced, journalists at each publisher have wrangled meetings with business-side higher-ups to learn more about the agreements, looking for one crucial piece of information: What\u2019s in it for the journalists?\n\nA sense of urgency\n\nIn the face of an increasing number of AI media deals, news guilds are now notching up the pace of negotiations to put in place AI protections similar to the ones Hollywood writing teams fought for.\n\n\u201cThe Writers Guild and Vox Media Union are firmly of the opinion that implementation of AI is a mandatory subject of bargaining, even though our contracts may not explicitly have AI provisions,\u201d McCarthy told TechCrunch. \u201cWe do have provisions in our contract that essentially mean that the company has to bargain with us over fundamental changes to our working conditions, and we very much believe this is a workplace issue, that it\u2019s a working conditions issue, and that the company is obligated to bargain with us about how this will work.\u201d\n\nThis means publishers that strike deals with AI providers might be contractually required to engage in discussions and negotiations with unions about these changes.\n\nThe Atlantic Media Union had also intended to bring this issue to the bargaining table, but the OpenAI deal adds a sense of urgency, one current employee told TechCrunch, requesting anonymity.\n\nDuring negotiations this month, The Atlantic\u2019s union put forward a proposal, per which AI wouldn\u2019t be used to replace writing, fact-checking, copy editing and illustration. It also proposed that writers can use AI at their discretion, in accordance with journalistic principles and ethics, but they can\u2019t be made to use it. That proposal is yet to be accepted.\n\nOther unions are working to put in similar protections. Nebraska journalists at the Omaha World-Herald Guild secured protections from AI earlier this year. In 2023, after CNET published a series of AI-generated articles, journalists at the publication went public with their union drive, demanding AI protections and a say in how AI is implemented in employee workflows.\n\nMaking companies include such safeguards in journalists\u2019 contracts is vital, because protection from the law isn\u2019t guaranteed. Companies like OpenAI contend that they\u2019re not breaking copyright laws by scraping what they say is publicly available content. They also say their chatbots don\u2019t reproduce the material in its entirety.\n\nBut publications like The New York Times, Raw Story, AlterNet and The Intercept have all sued OpenAI for using copyrighted works by journalists to train ChatGPT without properly crediting or citing the sources. Novelists, computer programmers and other groups have also filed copyright suits against OpenAI and other companies building generative AI.\n\nRichard Tofel, former president of nonprofit newsroom ProPublica and a consultant to news outlets, thinks these lawsuits will end up in the Supreme Court. If the courts rule that OpenAI and others are guilty of copyright infringement, \u201cthey\u2019ll need to make a deal with everybody.\u201d\n\nTofel thinks most publishers will end up making deals with AI companies. He noted that Google also faced similar copyright suits back when its search product was taking off, but by the time those were settled, users were so dependent on search that no publisher wanted to keep its content out of it.\n\nMcCarthy says writers can\u2019t rely only on the courts: \u201cWe have to look at every potential avenue as a way to push back against AI implementation.\u201d\n\nAnother concern for journalists is the adoption of AI by publishers for writing content, which some media outlets have already begun experimenting with.\n\nCNET and Gannett have published AI-generated stories and art, and in the case of Sports Illustrated, under fabricated bylines. Those stories were called out as AI-generated mainly because they were riddled with factual errors, but if AI gets a free pass to train on good journalism, those obvious errors may decrease over time.\n\nIf journalists won\u2019t question this, who will?\n\nJournalists understand the basic structure of the deals, but they still have questions.\n\nThe Atlantic\u2019s VP of communications, Anna Bross, said the company\u2019s partnership positions it as a premium news source within OpenAI, similar to other publishers\u2019 deals.\n\n\u201cThe Atlantic\u2019s articles will be discoverable within OpenAI\u2019s products, including ChatGPT, and as a partner, The Atlantic will help to shape how news is surfaced and presented in future real-time discovery products,\u201d Bross told TechCrunch. \u201cThe deal ensures guardrails and protections around how our content does appear within OpenAI\u2019s products. \u2026 If an Atlantic article is surfaced in response to a query, there will be Atlantic branding and a link back to the article on our site.\u201d\n\nBross noted that this is not a syndication license, meaning that OpenAI doesn\u2019t have permission to reproduce The Atlantic\u2019s articles or create similar reproductions of whole articles or lengthy excerpts.\n\nHowever, Atlantic journalists are still waiting on their leadership to explain why such content doesn\u2019t qualify as derivative work, which they would have the chance of being paid directly for.

It comes with science-based explanations on gamma, beta, alpha and theta brain waves and what it says about one\u2019s state of mind, but it\u2019s arguably the personalized visualization that they will remember the most.\n\n\u201cWe created a visualization engine that was about how clouds form, because Richard Wright was an amateur photographer who took thousands of pictures of clouds,\u201d Wiesler said.

#https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/22/what-does-open-source-ai-mean-anyway/
{"title": "What does \u2018open source AI\u2019 mean, anyway?", "text": "The struggle between open source and proprietary software is well understood. But the tensions permeating software circles for decades have shuffled into the artificial intelligence space, in part because no one can agree on what \u201copen source\u201d really means in the context of AI.\n\nThe New York Times recently published a gushing appraisal of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, noting how his \u201copen source AI\u201d embrace had made him popular once more in Silicon Valley. By most estimations, however, Meta\u2019s Llama-branded large language models aren\u2019t really open source, which highlights the crux of the debate.\n\nIt\u2019s this challenge that the Open Source Initiative (OSI) is trying to address, led by executive director Stefano Maffulli (pictured above), through conferences, workshops, panels, webinars, reports and more.\n\nAI ain\u2019t software code\n\nImage Credits: Westend61 via Getty\n\nThe OSI has been a steward of the Open Source Definition (OSD) for more than a quarter of a century, setting out how the term \u201copen source\u201d can, or should, be applied to software. A license that meets this definition can legitimately be deemed \u201copen source,\u201d though it recognizes a spectrum of licenses ranging from extremely permissive to not quite so permissive.\n\nBut transposing legacy licensing and naming conventions from software onto AI is problematic. Joseph Jacks, open source evangelist and founder of VC firm OSS Capital, goes as far as to say that there is \u201cno such thing as open-source AI,\u201d noting that \u201copen source was invented explicitly for software source code.\u201d Further, \u201cneural network weights\u201d (NNWs) \u2014 a term used in the world of artificial intelligence to describe the parameters or coefficients through which the network learns during the training process \u2014 aren\u2019t in any meaningful way comparable to software.\n\n\u201cNeural net weights are not software source code; they are unreadable by humans, [and they are not] debuggable,\u201d Jacks notes. \u201cFurthermore, the fundamental rights of open source also don\u2019t translate over to NNWs in any congruent manner.\u201d\n\nThese inconsistencies last year led Jacks and OSS Capital colleague Heather Meeker to come up with their own definition of sorts, around the concept of \u201copen weights.\u201d And Maffulli, for what it\u2019s worth, agrees with them. \u201cThe point is correct,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cOne of the initial debates we had was whether to call it open source AI at all, but everyone was already using the term.\u201d\n\nMeta analysis\n\nImage Credits: Larysa Amosova via Getty\n\nFounded in 1998, the OSI is a not-for-profit public benefit corporation that works on a myriad of open source-related activities around advocacy, education and its core raison d\u2019\u00eatre: the Open Source Definition. Today, the organization relies on sponsorships for funding, with such esteemed members as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Cisco, Intel, Salesforce and Meta.\n\nMeta\u2019s involvement with the OSI is particularly notable right now as it pertains to the notion of \u201copen source AI.\u201d Despite Meta hanging its AI hat on the open-source peg, the company has notable restrictions in place regarding how its Llama models can be used: Sure, they can be used gratis for research and commercial use cases, but app developers with more than 700 million monthly users must request a special license from Meta, which it will grant purely at its own discretion.\n\nMeta\u2019s language around its LLMs is somewhat malleable. While the company did call its Llama 2 model open source, with the arrival of Llama 3 in April, it retreated somewhat from the terminology, using phrases such as \u201copenly available\u201d and \u201copenly accessible\u201d instead. But in some places, it still refers to the model as \u201copen source.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone else that is involved in the conversation is perfectly agreeing that Llama itself cannot be considered open source,\u201d Maffulli said. \u201cPeople I\u2019ve spoken with who work at Meta, they know that it\u2019s a little bit of a stretch.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, some might argue that there\u2019s a conflict of interest here: a company that has shown a desire to piggyback off the open source branding also provides finances to the stewards of \u201cthe definition\u201d?\n\nThis is one of the reasons why the OSI is trying to diversify its funding, recently securing a grant from the Sloan Foundation, which is helping to fund its multi-stakeholder global push to reach the Open Source AI Definition. TechCrunch can reveal this grant amounts to around $250,000, and Maffulli is hopeful that this can alter the optics around its reliance on corporate funding.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the things that the Sloan grant makes even more clear: We could say goodbye to Meta\u2019s money anytime,\u201d Maffulli said. \u201cWe could do that even before this Sloan Grant, because I know that we\u2019re going to be getting donations from others. And Meta knows that very well. They\u2019re not interfering with any of this [process], neither is Microsoft, or GitHub or Amazon or Google \u2014 they absolutely know that they cannot interfere, because the structure of the organization doesn\u2019t allow that.\u201d\n\nWorking definition of open source AI\n\nImage Credits: Aleksei Morozov / Getty Images\n\nThe current Open Source AI Definition draft sits at version 0.0.8, constituting three core parts: the \u201cpreamble,\u201d which lays out the document\u2019s remit; the Open Source AI Definition itself; and a checklist that runs through the components required for an open source-compliant AI system.\n\nAs per the current draft, an Open Source AI system should grant freedoms to use the system for any purpose without seeking permission; to allow others to study how the system works and inspect its components; and to modify and share the system for any purpose.\n\nBut one of the biggest challenges has been around data \u2014 that is, can an AI system be classified as \u201copen source\u201d if the company hasn\u2019t made the training dataset available for others to poke at? According to Maffulli, it\u2019s more important to know where the data came from, and how a developer labeled, de-duplicated and filtered the data. And also, having access to the code that was used to assemble the dataset from its various sources.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much better to know that information than to have the plain dataset without the rest of it,\u201d Maffulli said.\n\nWhile having access to the full dataset would be nice (the OSI makes this an \u201coptional\u201d component), Maffulli says that it\u2019s not possible or practical in many cases. This might be because there is confidential or copyrighted information contained within the dataset that the developer doesn\u2019t have permission to redistribute. Moreover, there are techniques to train machine learning models whereby the data itself isn\u2019t actually shared with the system, using techniques such as federated learning, differential privacy and homomorphic encryption.\n\nAnd this perfectly highlights the fundamental differences between \u201copen source software\u201d and \u201copen source AI\u201d: The intentions might be similar, but they are not like-for-like comparable, and this disparity is what the OSI is trying to capture in its definition.\n\nIn software, source code and binary code are two views of the same artifact: They reflect the same program in different forms. But training datasets and the subsequent trained models are distinct things: You can take that same dataset, and you won\u2019t necessarily be able to re-create the same model consistently.\n\n\u201cThere is a variety of statistical and random logic that happens during the training that means it cannot make it replicable in the same way as software,\u201d Maffulli added.\n\nSo an open source AI system should be easy to replicate, with clear instructions. And this is where the checklist facet of the Open Source AI Definition comes into play, which is based on a recently published academic paper called \u201cThe Model Openness Framework: Promoting Completeness and Openness for Reproducibility, Transparency, and Usability in Artificial Intelligence.\u201d\n\nThis paper proposes the Model Openness Framework (MOF), a classification system that rates machine learning models \u201cbased on their completeness and openness.\u201d The MOF demands that specific components of the AI model development be \u201cincluded and released under appropriate open licenses,\u201d including training methodologies and details around the model parameters.\n\nStable condition\n\nStefano Maffulli presenting at the Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA) members summit in Addis Ababa. Image Credits: OSI\n\nThe OSI is calling the official launch of the definition the \u201cstable version,\u201d much like a company will do with an application that has undergone extensive testing and debugging ahead of prime time. The OSI is purposefully not calling it the \u201cfinal release\u201d because parts of it will likely evolve.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t really expect this definition to last for 26 years like the Open Source Definition,\u201d Maffulli said. \u201cI don\u2019t expect the top part of the definition \u2014 such as \u2018what is an AI system?\u2019 \u2014 to change much. But the parts that we refer to in the checklist, those lists of components depend on technology? Tomorrow, who knows what the technology will look like.\u201d\n\nThe stable Open Source AI Definition is expected to be rubber stamped by the Board at the All Things Open conference at the tail end of October, with the OSI embarking on a global roadshow in the intervening months spanning five continents, seeking more \u201cdiverse input\u201d on how \u201copen source AI\u201d will be defined moving forward. But any final changes are likely to be little more than \u201csmall tweaks\u201d here and there.\n\n\u201cThis is the final stretch,\u201d Maffulli said. \u201cWe have reached a feature complete version of the definition; we have all the elements that we need. Now we have a checklist, so we\u2019re checking that there are no surprises in there; there are no systems that should be included or excluded.\u201d", "authors": "['Paul Sawers']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/dreamhost_-_stefano_maffulli_headshot.webp?resize=1200,1196", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

Today, the organization relies on sponsorships for funding, with such esteemed members as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Cisco, Intel, Salesforce and Meta.\n\nMeta\u2019s involvement with the OSI is particularly notable right now as it pertains to the notion of \u201copen source AI.\u201d Despite Meta hanging its AI hat on the open-source peg, the company has notable restrictions in place regarding how its Llama models can be used: Sure, they can be used gratis for research and commercial use cases, but app developers with more than 700 million monthly users must request a special license from Meta, which it will grant purely at its own discretion.\n\nMeta\u2019s language around its LLMs is somewhat malleable. While the company did call its Llama 2 model open source, with the arrival of Llama 3 in April, it retreated somewhat from the terminology, using phrases such as \u201copenly available\u201d and \u201copenly accessible\u201d instead. But in some places, it still refers to the model as \u201copen source.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone else that is involved in the conversation is perfectly agreeing that Llama itself cannot be considered open source,\u201d Maffulli said. \u201cPeople I\u2019ve spoken with who work at Meta, they know that it\u2019s a little bit of a stretch.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, some might argue that there\u2019s a conflict of interest here: a company that has shown a desire to piggyback off the open source branding also provides finances to the stewards of \u201cthe definition\u201d?\n\nThis is one of the reasons why the OSI is trying to diversify its funding, recently securing a grant from the Sloan Foundation, which is helping to fund its multi-stakeholder global push to reach the Open Source AI Definition. TechCrunch can reveal this grant amounts to around $250,000, and Maffulli is hopeful that this can alter the optics around its reliance on corporate funding.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the things that the Sloan grant makes even more clear: We could say goodbye to Meta\u2019s money anytime,\u201d Maffulli said. \u201cWe could do that even before this Sloan Grant, because I know that we\u2019re going to be getting donations from others. And Meta knows that very well. They\u2019re not interfering with any of this [process], neither is Microsoft, or GitHub or Amazon or Google \u2014 they absolutely know that they cannot interfere, because the structure of the organization doesn\u2019t allow that.\u201d\n\nWorking definition of open source AI\n\nImage Credits: Aleksei Morozov / Getty Images\n\nThe current Open Source AI Definition draft sits at version 0.0.8, constituting three core parts: the \u201cpreamble,\u201d which lays out the document\u2019s remit; the Open Source AI Definition itself; and a checklist that runs through the components required for an open source-compliant AI system.\n\nAs per the current draft, an Open Source AI system should grant freedoms to use the system for any purpose without seeking permission; to allow others to study how the system works and inspect its components; and to modify and share the system for any purpose.\n\nBut one of the biggest challenges has been around data \u2014 that is, can an AI system be classified as \u201copen source\u201d if the company hasn\u2019t made the training dataset available for others to poke at? According to Maffulli, it\u2019s more important to know where the data came from, and how a developer labeled, de-duplicated and filtered the data. And also, having access to the code that was used to assemble the dataset from its various sources.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much better to know that information than to have the plain dataset without the rest of it,\u201d Maffulli said.\n\nWhile having access to the full dataset would be nice (the OSI makes this an \u201coptional\u201d component), Maffulli says that it\u2019s not possible or practical in many cases. This might be because there is confidential or copyrighted information contained within the dataset that the developer doesn\u2019t have permission to redistribute. Moreover, there are techniques to train machine learning models whereby the data itself isn\u2019t actually shared with the system, using techniques such as federated learning, differential privacy and homomorphic encryption.\n\nAnd this perfectly highlights the fundamental differences between \u201copen source software\u201d and \u201copen source AI\u201d: The intentions might be similar, but they are not like-for-like comparable, and this disparity is what the OSI is trying to capture in its definition.\n\nIn software, source code and binary code are two views of the same artifact: They reflect the same program in different forms. But training datasets and the subsequent trained models are distinct things: You can take that same dataset, and you won\u2019t necessarily be able to re-create the same model consistently.\n\n\u201cThere is a variety of statistical and random logic that happens during the training that means it cannot make it replicable in the same way as software,\u201d Maffulli added.\n\nSo an open source AI system should be easy to replicate, with clear instructions. And this is where the checklist facet of the Open Source AI Definition comes into play, which is based on a recently published academic paper called \u201cThe Model Openness Framework: Promoting Completeness and Openness for Reproducibility, Transparency, and Usability in Artificial Intelligence.\u201d\n\nThis paper proposes the Model Openness Framework (MOF), a classification system that rates machine learning models \u201cbased on their completeness and openness.\u201d The MOF demands that specific components of the AI model development be \u201cincluded and released under appropriate open licenses,\u201d including training methodologies and details around the model parameters.\n\nStable condition\n\nStefano Maffulli presenting at the Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA) members summit in Addis Ababa. Image Credits: OSI\n\nThe OSI is calling the official launch of the definition the \u201cstable version,\u201d much like a company will do with an application that has undergone extensive testing and debugging ahead of prime time. The OSI is purposefully not calling it the \u201cfinal release\u201d because parts of it will likely evolve.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t really expect this definition to last for 26 years like the Open Source Definition,\u201d Maffulli said. \u201cI don\u2019t expect the top part of the definition \u2014 such as \u2018what is an AI system?\u2019 \u2014 to change much. But the parts that we refer to in the checklist, those lists of components depend on technology? Tomorrow, who knows what the technology will look like.\u201d\n\nThe stable Open Source AI Definition is expected to be rubber stamped by the Board at the All Things Open conference at the tail end of October, with the OSI embarking on a global roadshow in the intervening months spanning five continents, seeking more \u201cdiverse input\u201d on how \u201copen source AI\u201d will be defined moving forward. But any final changes are likely to be little more than \u201csmall tweaks\u201d here and there.\n\n\u201cThis is the final stretch,\u201d Maffulli said. \u201cWe have reached a feature complete version of the definition; we have all the elements that we need. Now we have a checklist, so we\u2019re checking that there are no surprises in there; there are no systems that should be included or excluded.\u201d", "authors": "['Paul Sawers']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/dreamhost_-_stefano_maffulli_headshot.webp?resize=1200,1196", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

Heights loaned Fisker more than $500 million in 2023 (with the option to convert that debt to stock in the startup) at a time when the company\u2019s financial distress was looming behind the scenes.\n\nThat funding was not originally secured by any assets. That changed after Fisker breached one of the covenants when it failed to file its third-quarter financial statements on time in late 2023. In exchange for waiving that breach, Fisker agreed to give Heights first-priority on all of its current and future assets, giving Heights considerable leverage. Heights not only gained pole position to determine what happens to the assets in the Chapter 11 proceedings, but also gave them the chance to tap a preferred restructuring officer to oversee the company\u2019s slow descent into bankruptcy.\n\nAlex Lees, a lawyer from the firm Milbank who represents a group of unsecured creditors owed more than $600 million, said in the proceeding\u2019s first hearing on Friday in Delaware Bankruptcy Court that it took \u201ctoo long\u201d to get to this point. He said Fisker\u2019s tardy regulatory filing was a \u201cminor technical default\u201d that somehow led to the startup \u201cbasically hand[ing] the whole business over to Heights.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe this was a terrible deal for [Fisker] and its creditors,\u201d Lees said at the hearing. \u201cThe right thing to do would have been to file for bankruptcy months ago.\u201d In the meantime, he said, Fisker has been \u201cliquidating outside the court\u2019s supervision\u201d for the benefit of Heights in what he said amounts to \u201csuspect activity.\u201d Fisker has spent the run-up to the bankruptcy filing slashing prices and selling off vehicles.\n\nScott Greissman, a lawyer representing the investment arm of Heights, said Lees\u2019 comments were \u201ccompletely inappropriate, completely unsupported,\u201d and derided them as \u201cdesigned as sound bites\u201d meant to be picked up by the media.\n\nan\u201dThere may be a lot of disappointed creditors\u201d in this case, Greissman said, \u201cnone more so than Heights.\u201d He said Heights extended \u201can enormous amount of credit\u201d to Fisker. He added later that even if Fisker is able to sell its entire remaining inventory \u2014 around 4,300 Ocean SUVs \u2014 such a sale \u201cwill maybe pay off a fraction of Heights\u2019 secured debt,\u201d which currently sits at more than $180 million.\n\nLawyers told the court Friday that they have an agreement in principle to sell those Ocean SUVs to an unnamed vehicle leasing company. But it\u2019s not immediately clear what other assets Fisker could sell in order to provide returns for other creditors. The company has claimed to have between $500 million and $1 billion in assets, but the filings so far have only detailed manufacturing equipment, including 180 assembly robots, an entire underbody line, a paint shop and other specialized tools.\n\nLees was not alone in his concern over how Fisker wound up filing for bankruptcy. \u201cI don\u2019t know why it took this long,\u201d Linda Richenderfer, a lawyer with the U.S. Trustee\u2019s Office, said during the hearing. She also noted that she was still reviewing new filings late Thursday and in the hours before the hearing.\n\nShe also expressed \u201cgreat concern\u201d that the case could convert to a straight Chapter 7 liquidation following the sale of the Ocean inventory, leaving other creditors fighting for scraps.\n\nGreissman said at one point that he agreed that Fisker \u201cprobably took more time\u201d than needed to file for bankruptcy protection, and that some of these quarrels could have been \u201cmore easily resolved\u201d if the case had started sooner. He even said he agrees with Richenderfer that \u201ceven with a fleet sale, Chapter 11 may not be sustainable.\u201d\n\nThe parties will meet again at the next hearing on June 27.\n\nBefore he dismissed everyone, Judge Thomas Horan thanked all the parties involved for getting to the hearing \u201cpretty cleanly\u201d despite the rush of filings this week.

#https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/19/the-fall-of-ev-startup-fisker-a-comprehensive-timeline/
{"title": "The fall of EV startup Fisker: A comprehensive timeline", "text": "Henrik Fisker once envisioned a burgeoning EV empire at the startup he named after himself, which was to be led by the Ocean SUV. But cracks started showing in that vision almost as soon as the Ocean hit the road in 2023.\n\nFisker cut production targets multiple times, failed to meet sales goals and laid off staff. What\u2019s more, its Ocean SUV was beset with software and mechanical issues, rendering it inoperable for some. Add troublesome brakes, sudden power loss and doors that wouldn\u2019t open to the list of issues that led to multiple safety investigations and ultimately a pause in production in order to raise new capital.\n\nAll of this and more has forced Fisker to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, marking the beginning of an inauspicious period for the eponymous startup. Below is a timeline of the events that led the automaker to this point.\n\n2023\n\nFisker fell short of its Q2 production target\n\nJuly 7 \u2014 The automaker produced 1,022 Ocean SUVs in the second quarter of 2023, several hundred vehicles short of its expectation of producing between 1,400 and 1,700 EVs.\n\nFisker sold convertible notes to fund operations\n\nJuly 10 \u2014 Fisker announced plans to sell $340 million in convertible debt, expecting the net proceeds to be $296.7 million. The automaker said it planned to use the funds to support its general corporate operations and add an additional battery pack line to \u201csupport growth\u201d in 2024 and beyond. The company said funds will also be used for capital expenditures and the development of future products.\n\nProduction target cut\n\nDecember 1 \u2014 Fisker cut its annual production guidance in an effort to free up $300 million in working capital. The company said it expected to produce about 10,000 vehicles in 2023. The production guidance is just a quarter of Fisker\u2019s bullish forecast from a year ago.\n\n2024\n\nFisker struggled to meet internal sales goals\n\nJanuary 1 \u2014 Fisker remained far from meeting its publicly stated goal of delivering 300 electric SUVs per day globally. The EV startup spent much of December aiming to meet an internal sales goal of between 100 and 200 vehicles a day in North America, where the bulk of its inventory and sales efforts are. Fisker fell well below that target, often selling just one to two dozen of its Ocean SUVs a day here.\n\nOcean SUV investigated over braking loss complaints\n\nJanuary 15 \u2014 Federal safety regulators have opened an investigation into Fisker\u2019s first electric vehicle over braking problems. Owners had lodged 19 complaints with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on issues ranging from brake loss to problems with the gear shifter to a driver door failing to open from the interior and two instances of the vehicle\u2019s hood suddenly flying up on the highway.\n\nOwners had flagged sudden power loss and brake problems for months\n\nFebruary 9 \u2014 Since the initial fleet of Fisker Ocean SUVs were delivered, customers have reported more than 100 separate loss-of-power incidents. The company told TechCrunch it believes these problems are rare and that it has resolved \u201calmost all the issues\u201d with software updates. Customers have also reported sudden loss of braking power, problematic key fobs causing them to get locked inside or outside of the vehicle, seat sensors that don\u2019t detect the driver\u2019s presence and the SUV\u2019s front hood suddenly flying up at high speeds.\n\nFeds opened second probe into the Ocean SUV after rollaway complaints\n\nFebruary 16 \u2014 The NHTSA opened a second investigation into Fisker\u2019s Ocean SUV after the agency received four complaints about the vehicle rolling away unexpectedly, resulting in one injury. The company told TechCrunch it is \u201cfully cooperating\u201d with the safety agency.\n\nFisker laid off 15% of staff\n\nFebruary 29 \u2014 Fisker announced its plan to lay off 15% of its workforce and says it likely does not have enough cash on hand to survive the next 12 months. The company says it is trying to find a way to raise that money as it works through a pivot from direct sales to a dealership model.\n\nPause in production with just $121 million in the bank\n\nMarch 18 \u2014 Fisker announced it would pause production of its electric Ocean SUV for six weeks as it scrambles for a cash infusion. The company said in a regulatory filing that it had just $121 million in cash and cash equivalents as of March 15, $32 million of which is restricted or not immediately accessible. Fisker also said that its accounts payable balance is up to $182 million and that there is \u201csubstantial doubt\u201d that it can continue operations without raising new capital.\n\nFisker lost Nissan deal, putting rescue funds at risk\n\nMarch 25 \u2014 The negotiations between Fisker and a large automaker \u2014 reported to be Nissan \u2014 over a potential investment and collaboration were terminated, a development that puts a separate near-term rescue funding effort in danger. Fisker revealed in a regulatory filing that the automaker terminated the negotiations March 22. It did not explain why. But the company had to keep the negotiations going as part of one of the closing conditions for a potential $150 million convertible note.\n\nTrading suspended by NYSE\n\nMarch 25 \u2014 The New York Stock Exchange suspended trading shares of Fisker and moved to take the company off its stock exchange, because it is \u201cno longer suitable for listing\u201d because of \u201cabnormally low\u201d price levels.\n\nFisker lost track of millions of dollars in customer payments for months\n\nMarch 27 \u2014 Fisker temporarily lost track of millions of dollars in customer payments as it scaled up deliveries, leading to an internal audit that started in December and took months to complete. Fisker struggled to keep tabs on these transactions, which included down payments and in some cases, the full price of the vehicles, because of lax internal procedures for keeping track of them, according to three people familiar with the internal payment crisis. In a few cases, it delivered vehicles without collecting any form of payment at all, they said.\n\nNew round of layoffs to \u2018preserve cash\u2019\n\nApril 29 \u2014 Fisker laid off more employees to \u201cpreserve cash,\u201d making good on a plan announced one week before, according to an internal email viewed by TechCrunch. Fisker expects to seek bankruptcy protection within the next 30 days if it can\u2019t come up with that money, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulatory filing.\n\nFisker stiffed engineering firm\n\nMay 3 \u2014 Fisker stopped paying the engineering firm that helped develop the Pear, a low-cost EV meant for the masses, and the Alaska, Fisker\u2019s entry into the red-hot pickup truck market. The firm also accuses Fisker of wrongfully holding on to IP associated with those vehicles.\n\nFisker Ocean faced fourth federal safety probe\n\nMay 10 \u2014 The NHTSA opened a fourth investigation into the Fisker Ocean SUV to probe multiple claims of \u201cinadvertent Automatic Emergency Braking.\u201d The eight complaints allege that owners experienced sudden activation of the Automatic Emergency Braking system in moments where there were no other vehicles or obstructions in the path of their cars.\n\nHundreds of workers cut to keep EV startup alive\n\nMay 29 \u2014 Hundreds more employees were laid off during the final week of May in a bid to stay alive, as the automaker continues to search for funding, a buyout or prepare for bankruptcy. One current and one laid off employee estimated that only about 150 people remained at the company.\n\nInside Fisker\u2019s collapse\n\nMay 31 \u2014 The road to Fisker\u2019s ultimate ruin may have started and ended with its flawed Ocean SUV, which was riddled with mechanical and software problems. But it was paved with hubris, power struggles, and the repeated failure to set up basic processes that are foundational for any automaker.\n\nOcean SUV issued first recall\n\nJune 12 \u2014 Fisker issued the first recall for the Ocean SUV because of problems with the warning lights, according to new information published by the NHTSA. The instrument panel displays the brake, park and antilock brake system warning lights in the wrong font size and, at times, in the wrong color, making them noncompliant with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. The agency also says \u201cmultiple warning lights fail to illuminate during the ignition cycle.\u201d\n\nFisker filed for bankruptcy\n\nJune 18 \u2014 After a year of struggling to stay afloat, Fisker filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The California-based company had been seeking a deal with another automaker in a last-ditch effort to rescue the enterprise. The company estimated assets of $500 million to $1 billion and liabilities of between $100 million and $500 million, according to the filing.\n\nFisker failed because it wasn\u2019t ready to be a car company\n\nJune 18 \u2014 In the wake of its bankruptcy, Fisker said it will continue \u201creduced operations,\u201d including \u201cpreserving customer programs, and compensating needed vendors on a go-forward basis.\u201d In other words, it will continue to manage a bare-bones operation in case there is a willing buyer of the assets it\u2019s putting up for sale in the Chapter 11 case.\n\nFisker faced financial distress as early as August 2023\n\nJune 21 \u2014 According to a new filing in its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding, Fisker was facing \u201cpotential financial distress\u201d as early as August 2023. That looming financial distress drove Fisker to solicit a partnership or investment from another automaker, according to the filing.\n\nThe fight over Fisker\u2019s assets is already heating up\n\nJune 21 \u2014 The fight over Fisker\u2019s assets is already charged just days into its bankruptcy filing, with one lawyer claiming the startup has been liquidating assets \u201coutside the court\u2019s supervision.\u201d At issue is the relationship between Fisker and its largest secured lender, which loaned Fisker more than $500 million in 2023 at a time when the company\u2019s financial distress was looming behind the scenes.", "authors": "['Henry Pickavet']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/fisker-timeline-v6.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "YouTube is testing another way to combat ad blockers", "text": "YouTube continues its efforts to circumvent ad blockers. Earlier this week, ad blocker SponsorBlock posted that the Google-owned video service is testing out server-side ad injection with a limited number of users.\n\nEssentially, this means that the ad is injected into the video before it arrives on your device (in contrast to client-side ad injection, where the ads arrive at your device separately), making it harder for software to detect and block the ad.\n\n\u201cThis breaks sponsorblock since now all timestamps are offset by the ad times,\u201d SponsorBlock said.\n\nA Google spokesperson seemed to confirm the test in a statement, writing that the service is \u201cimproving its performance and reliability in serving both organic and ad video content,\u201d with an update that \u201cmay result in suboptimal viewing experiences for viewers with ad blockers installed.\u201d\n\nGoogle reiterated its position that ad blockers \u201cviolate YouTube\u2019s Terms of Service\u201d and that viewers who want an ad-free experience should sign up for YouTube Premium.\n\nThis is just the latest move in an ongoing battle, with YouTube constantly finding new ways to get around ad blockers and the ad blockers then trying to adapt. In fact, the company rolled out a pop-up message last year that essentially prevented visitors from watching videos on YouTube unless they disabled their ad blockers.\n\nWhen I spoke to the companies behind several ad blockers last fall, Ghostery\u2019s director of product and engineering Krzysztof Modras told me that \u201cas one of the world\u2019s largest publishers, YouTube constantly invests in circumventing ad blocking\u201d and that it \u201cseems to be adapting [its] methods more frequently than ever before.\u201d\n\nMore recently, an email from another ad blocker, AdGuard, suggested that while the server-side approach is new to YouTube on the web, the service has already been doing something similar in its mobile apps.\n\nAdGuard said it remains \u201coptimistic that solutions will emerge, albeit requiring concerted efforts and innovative approaches from ad-blocking developers and ad filtering community.\u201d", "authors": "['Anthony Ha']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ad-blocker-fbi.jpg?resize=1200,801", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "US sues Adobe for hiding termination fees and making it difficult to cancel subscriptions", "text": "The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Adobe alleging that the company deceives consumers by hiding the early-termination fee and making it difficult for people to cancel their subscriptions.\n\nIn the complaint filed on Monday, the DOJ wrote that \u201cAdobe has harmed consumers by enrolling them in its default, most lucrative subscription plan without clearly disclosing important plan terms.\u201d\n\nThe government says Adobe pushed consumers toward the \u201cannual paid monthly\u201d subscription without informing them that canceling the plan in the first year would cost hundreds of dollars.\n\nAdobe only discloses the early-termination fees when subscribers attempt to cancel, and turns the early-termination fee into a \u201cpowerful retention tool\u201d by trapping consumers in subscriptions that they no longer want, the complaint says.\n\n\u201cDuring enrollment, Adobe hides material terms of its APM plan in fine print and behind option textboxes and hyperlinks, proving disclosures that are designed to go unnoticed and that most consumers never see,\u201d according to the complaint. \u201cAdobe then deters cancellations by employing an onerous and complicated cancellation process.\u201d\n\nAdobe says it plans to refute the claims in court.\n\n\u201cSubscription services are convenient, flexible and cost effective to allow users to choose the plan that best fits their needs, timeline and budget,\u201d said Adobe\u2019s General Counsel and Chief Trust Officer Dana Rao, in a statement. \u201cOur priority is to always ensure our customers have a positive experience.

In the past, users could access the company\u2019s software after paying a one-time fee.\n\nSubscriptions account for most of the company\u2019s revenue, according to the Federal Trade Commission, which launched a similar lawsuit against Amazon last year, saying it \u201cknowingly\u201d complicates the ability of customers of its Prime service to cancel their subscriptions.", "authors": "['Aisha Malik']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-95799630.jpg?resize=1200,800", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "iOS 18 could \u2018sherlock\u2019 $400M in app revenue", "text": "Apple\u2019s practice of leveraging ideas from its third-party developer community to become new iOS and Mac features and apps has a hefty price tag, a new report indicates. With the release of iOS 18 later this fall, Apple\u2019s changes may affect apps that today have an estimated $393 million in revenue and have been downloaded roughly 58 million times over the past year, according to an analysis by app intelligence firm Appfigures.\n\nEvery June at Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference, the iPhone maker teases the upcoming releases of its software and operating systems, which often include features previously only available through third-party apps. The practice is so common now it\u2019s even been given a name: \u201csherlocking\u201d \u2014 a reference to a 1990s search app for Mac that borrowed features from a third-party app known as Watson. Now when Apple launches a new feature that was before the domain of a third-party app, it\u2019s said to have \u201csherlocked\u201d the app.\n\nIn earlier years, sherlocking apps made some sense. After all, did the iPhone\u2019s flashlight really need to be a third-party offering, or would it be better as a built-in function? Plus, Apple has been able to launch features that made its software better adapted to consumers\u2019 wants and needs by looking at what\u2019s popular among the third-party developer community.\n\nOf course, this practice also raises the question as to whether Apple is leveraging proprietary data to make its determinations about what to build next, and whether the apps it competes with are being offered an even playing field. For example, before Apple launched its own parental controls system, it shut down many third-party apps that had built businesses in this space by saying their solutions were now noncompliant with its rules and policies. The apps weren\u2019t offered access to a developer API for managing Apple\u2019s built-in parental controls for years, prompting an antitrust investigation.\n\nIn more recent years, Apple has \u201csherlocked\u201d third parties with launches of features like Continuity Camera, medication tracking, sleep tracking and mood tracking, as well as apps like Freeform and Journal. This year, it turned its attention to password managers, call recording and transcription apps, those for making custom emoji, AI-powered writing tools and math helpers, trail apps and more.\n\nIn an analysis of third-party apps that generated more than 1,000 downloads per year, Appfigures discovered several genres that had found themselves in Apple\u2019s crosshairs in 2024.\n\nIn terms of worldwide gross revenue, these categories have generated significant income over the past 12 months, with the trail app category making the most at $307 million per year, led by market leader and 2023 Apple \u201cApp of the Year\u201d AllTrails. Grammar helper apps, like Grammarly and others, also generated $35.7 million, while math helpers and password managers earned $23.4 million and $20.3 million, respectively. Apps for making custom emoji generated $7 million, too.\n\nImage Credits: Appfigures\n\nOf these, trail apps accounted for the vast majority of \u201cpotentially sherlocked\u201d revenue, or 78%, noted Appfigures, as well as 40% of downloads of sherlocked apps. In May 2024, they accounted for an estimated $28.8 million in gross consumer spending and 2.5 million downloads, to give you an idea of scale.\n\nMany of these app categories were growing quickly, with math solvers having seen revenue growth of 43% year-over-year followed by grammar helpers (+40%), password managers (+38%) and trail apps (+28%). Emoji-making apps, however, were seeing declines at -17% year-over-year.\n\nImage Credits: Appfigures\n\nBy downloads, grammar helpers had seen 9.4 million installs over the past 12 months, followed by emoji makers (10.6 million), math-solving apps (9.5 million) and password managers (457,000 installs).\n\nAlthough these apps certainly have dedicated user bases that may not immediately choose to switch to a first-party offering, Apple\u2019s ability to offer similar functionality built-in could be detrimental to their potential growth. Casual users may be satisfied by Apple\u2019s \u201cgood enough\u201d solutions and won\u2019t seek out alternatives.\n\nHowever, apps that continue to develop new features and add enhancements beyond what Apple includes while also taking advantage of other new ways to reach users, like through Apple\u2019s improved Siri, may have a better shot than others.", "authors": "['Sarah Perez']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/app-store-2024-v1.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}
#https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/19/meta-ai-removes-block-on-election-related-queries-in-india-while-google-still-applying-limits/
{"title": "Meta AI removes block on election-related queries in India while Google still applies limits", "text": "With India\u2019s election process completed and the new government starting its tenure in office, Meta has removed its restriction on election-related queries using its Meta AI chatbot. However, Google is still applying limits as part of its global restrictions on this type of queries.\n\nMeta\u2019s approach\n\nMeta\u2019s restrictions lift means you can search for queries related to India\u2019s election results, information on politicians, and details about officeholders. TechCrunch was able to get answers about election results, political figures, and officeholders from Meta AI. Meta didn\u2019t provide any statement on this.\n\nThe company first started blocking certain political queries when the election in India commenced in April. At the time, Meta AI was pointing people toward the Election Commission\u2019s website when they asked about politicians, candidates, officeholders, and information about political parties.\n\n\u201cThis is a new technology, and it may not always return the response we intend, which is the same for all generative AI systems. Since we launched, we\u2019ve constantly released updates and improvements to our models, and we\u2019re continuing to work on making them better,\u201d a company spokesperson told TechCrunch at that time.\n\nNotably, Meta\u2019s AI chatbot is still in the test phase in India with limited number of people being able to access it on WhatsApp and Instagram.\n\nGoogle\u2019s approach\n\nGoogle launched its Gemini AI app for Android in India on Monday, which supports nine local languages. However, the company is not removing restrictions on election-related queries as part of a global policy. The company confirmed to TechCrunch that it is still applying these limits.\n\n\u201cWith major elections happening around the world this year, and out of an abundance of caution, we\u2019re restricting the types of election-related queries for which Gemini will return responses and instead point people to Google Search. These restrictions are applied globally,\u201d a Google spokesperson told TechCrunch in a statement.\n\nThe search giant started applying restrictions to these queries in any global market where elections are taking place earlier this year. But it\u2019s not clear if and when Google will lift the restrictions \u2014 especially in countries where elections are completed and the new governments have assumed their roles.\n\nThe approach to a chatbot answering political queries is different for Meta and Google. While Meta restricted queries for a limited period, Google continues to block election-related queries globally. It\u2019s not clear if this decision has anything to do with Google\u2019s AI going astray multiple times this year.\n\nOther chatbots like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot have a mixed approach. TechCrunch found that both bots don\u2019t answer questions like \u201cWho won the Indian general election of 2024?\u201d However, these tools fetch information from the web when we ask them about officeholders and politicians.\n\nCompanies developing AI tools are already under scrutiny for outputs showing bias and misinformation. The last thing these companies would want is to be caught in the political crossfire while trying to expand their AI apps in more regions.", "authors": "['Ivan Mehta']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-499837291.jpg?resize=1200,795", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.\n\nWhat does GPT mean in ChatGPT?\n\nGPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.\n\nWhat is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?\n\nA chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they\u2019ll give canned responses to questions.\n\nChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.\n\nCan ChatGPT write essays?\n\nYes.\n\nCan ChatGPT commit libel?\n\nDue to the nature of how these models work, they don\u2019t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That\u2019s a problem when you\u2019re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn\u2019t commit, that may well at this point be libel.\n\nWe will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.\n\nDoes ChatGPT have an app?\n\nYes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.\n\nWhat is the ChatGPT character limit?\n\nIt\u2019s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.\n\nDoes ChatGPT have an API?\n\nYes, it was released March 1, 2023.\n\nWhat are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?\n\nEveryday examples include programing, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.\n\nWhat are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?\n\nAdvanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.\n\nHow good is ChatGPT at writing code?\n\nIt depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can\u2019t necessarily program an entire app\u2019s worth of code. That\u2019s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness \u2014 in other words, the generated code isn\u2019t always appropriate for the specific context in which it\u2019s being used.\n\nCan you save a ChatGPT chat?\n\nYes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.\n\nAre there alternatives to ChatGPT?\n\nYes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google\u2019s Gemini and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.\n\nHow does ChatGPT handle data privacy?\n\nOpenAI has said that individuals in \u201ccertain jurisdictions\u201d (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression \u201cin accordance with applicable laws\u201d.\n\nThe web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled \u201cOpenAI Personal Data Removal Request\u201d.\n\nIn its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on \u201clegitimate interest\u201d (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out \u2014 when it writes: \u201cSee here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.\u201d\n\nWhat controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?\n\nRecently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI\u2019s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.\n\nAn Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT\u2019s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.\n\nCNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.\n\nSeveral major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.\n\nThere have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.\n\nWhere can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?\n\nSeveral marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.\n\nCan ChatGPT be detected?\n\nPoorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they\u2019re inconsistent at best.\n\nAre ChatGPT chats public?\n\nNo. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users\u2019 conversations to other people on the service.\n\nWhat lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?\n\nNone specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.\n\nAre there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?\n\nYes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.", "authors": "['Kyle Wiggers', 'Cody Corrall', 'Alyssa Stringer']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1462188043.jpg?resize=1200,798", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

This helps support our journalism. Learn more.\n\nSTEVE! (martin) A Documentary in 2 Pieces\n\nPutting this on the \u201cbest shows on Apple TV+\u201d list is a bit of a cheat. Rather than a series, this two-part documentary is more like a pair of movies looking at the life and career of Steve Martin. The first part chronicles his rise in, and reimagining of, the standup comedy world. The second looks at how he went from that to the neurotic and lovable neighbor he currently plays on Only Murders in the Building, which would be his career\u2019s triumphant second act if he hadn\u2019t had something like 30 acts in between. Directed by Morgan Neville, who made the backup singer documentary 20 Feet From Stardom and the Fred Rogers doc Won\u2019t You Be My Neighbor?, it\u2019s funny, intimate, and a little surprising\u2014just like Martin himself.\n\nLoot\n\nOK, so Loot isn't exactly about MacKenzie Scott's divorce from Jeff Bezos, but it is about a woman named Molly (Maya Rudolph) who separates from her tech billionaire husband and devotes herself to philanthropic work. Also, creators Alan Yang (Master of None) and Matt Hubbard (Superstore) were kind of inspired by Bezos and Scott's split. With an incredible supporting cast that includes Joel Kim Booster, Michaela Ja\u00e9 Rodriguez, and Adam Scott, it's a quirky comedy with a lot of heart\u2014and the kind of thing you (probably) won't see on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nThe Big Door Prize\n\nWith The Big Door Prize Chris O'Dowd finally got the \u201cguy leading a show\u201d role he was always meant for. In the series, he plays a 40-year-old high school teacher named Dusty who's pretty content with his life until a magic machine shows up in his small town. The machine, you see, tells people their life's potential, and as soon as people around him start using it, everything changes. Marriages end, paths divert, and eventually Dusty must confront whether he's happy in his own life. Season 2 of the series, which launched in spring 2024, explores what happens after everyone upends their lives.\n\nThe Completely Made-Up Adventures of Dick Turpin\n\nDick Turpin was a real highwayman in 18th-century England who was ultimately executed for horse theft. But the myths surrounding him are far more interesting than the facts. The Completely Made-Up Adventures of Dick Turpin, true to its name, opts to stick with the fun stuff. Starring Noel Fielding (The Great British Bake Off) in the title role, this six-episode series presents Turpin as someone who stumbled into leading a group of outlaws and made the best of it. Enjoy the ride.\n\nConstellation\n\nAround here we have a theory that Apple TV+ is the new HBO. At the same time, we also wonder among ourselves whether it\u2019s the new Syfy. After opening with a bang in 2019 with For All Mankind, it has released a steady drumbeat of trippy, spacey, timey-wimey prestige shows, from Foundation to Severance. The latest is Constellation, an eight-part thriller about an astronaut (Noomi Rapace) who returns to Earth after a disaster in space to find things are very off. Brain-bending and tense, it\u2019s the kind of sci-fi that sucks you in. Get lost.\n\nMasters of the Air\n\nGenerally speaking, \u201cWorld War II drama\u201d and Steven Spielberg is probably enough to get anyone to click Play on this series, but it\u2019s got a lot more than just a good elevator pitch. Based on Donald L. Miller\u2019s Masters of the Air, this series dives deep into the lives of the 100th Bomb Group\u2014aka the \u201cBloody Hundredth\u201d\u2014a group of pilots tasked with risking their lives to fight Nazi Germany from the air. Spielberg and Tom Hanks serve as executive producers, and the cast features Elvis himself, Austin Butler, as well as Saltburn\u2019s Barry Keoghan and Doctor Who\u2019s new Doctor, Ncuti Gatwa.\n\nThe New Look\n\nKeeping with the World War II theme, The New Look follows Christian Dior, Coco Chanel, Pierre Balmain, and Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga as they lay the path for modern fashion in Nazi-occupied Paris. The cast features Ben Mendelsohn as Christian Dior, Juliette Binoche as Coco Chanel, and Maisie Williams as Catherine Dior, and also has a soundtrack courtesy of Jack Antonoff that\u2019s chock full of early 20th-century music covered by the likes of Perfume Genius and Florence Welch.\n\nCriminal Record\n\nApple TV+\u2019s dramas are on a hot streak lately. Now that stellar series like For All Mankind and Slow Horses are finally getting audiences, the streamer is putting more in their queues with Criminal Record. Starring former Doctor Who Doctor Peter Capaldi, the crime drama follows two cops\u2014Capaldi\u2019s Daniel Hegarty and Cush Jumbo\u2019s June Lenker\u2014as they try to get to the bottom of a long-settled case. Daniel worked the case originally and got a confession; June got a fresh tip and wants him to reopen it and find out whether the man who went away for murder is actually innocent. Might sound a bit overdone, but the series also works in elements of law enforcement shortcomings and race in a rapidly-changing Britain for a series that\u2019s about more than just one case.\n\nHijack\n\nThere\u2019s this face Idris Elba does. He\u2019s been perfecting it since he was Stringer Bell on The Wire. It\u2019s the look of total calm even when he\u2019s talking about the most harrowing thing you can imagine. That face gets a full workout in Hijack, in which Elba plays a corporate negotiator who finds himself trying to settle things with a group of, yes, hijackers who have taken over the flight he\u2019s boarded to get home to his family. This series is seven episodes, roughly seven hours\u2014the same length of the flight, and it follows the drama in the air and the political maneuvering below before attempting to stick the landing. Do stay around until the end.\n\nFor All Mankind\n\nLong before Foundation, there was For All Mankind. The show not only set the tone for the kind of glossy prestige sci-fi Apple TV+ had ambitions to make, but it was also the streaming service's attempt to plant its flag in the realm of streaming giants. A solid slice of alternate history, the show starts with a very smart premise: What if the US had been edged out in putting a man on the moon? How would the space-race rivalry between the Americans and the Soviets have played out? It's mostly a slick, stylish, NASA-heavy period drama, but as this is from the brain of Ronald D. Moore, there are a few standout moments and episodes with attention shared around the large ensemble cast. It might be the best sci-fi show you're not watching, and if that's true you now have multiple seasons to catch up on.\n\nMessi Meets America\n\nIf your home screen hasn't made it obvious, Apple TV+ is super stoked about soccer these days. The streamer's latest foray: Messi Meets America, a six-part docuseries about all-star player Lionel Messi's move to Major League Soccer's Inter Miami club. The first three episodes aired on October 11, 2023, and subsequent episodes aired in conjunction with last year's MLS season. Messi Mania, indeed.\n\nLessons in Chemistry\n\nBased on the debut novel from science writer Bonnie Garmus, Lessons in Chemistry is the story of Elizabeth Zott (Brie Larson), who gets hired to host a cooking show after she's fired from the lab she was working in for doing science while female. Obviously, the show Elizabeth puts on ends up being about a lot more than just having dinner on the table at 6 pm, but we suggest you watch to find out just how revolutionary it is.\n\nThe Morning Show\n\nEvery streaming service needs a flashy mainstream drama with Hollywood heavyweights to pull in viewers. Apple TV+ has The Morning Show. When Alex Levy (Jennifer Aniston) loses her morning news program cohost Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell) following sexual misconduct accusations, she gets paired up with Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon). What unfolds is a #MeToo-era drama full of TV network intrigue and Sorkin-lite dialog. In its second season, it went deep on Covid-19, and in the third season the series' fictional network, UBA, finds itself dealing with the aftermath of a cyberattack. There's likely a new season coming in 2025, so now's a good time to catch up, or go back and refresh your memory.\n\nShining Girls\n\nThis Elisabeth Moss psychological thriller/murder mystery came out in 2022 and never really got the buzz it likely deserved. All of that to say, you should probably watch it if you haven't already. Moss plays Kirby, a woman who believes a recent Chicago murder may be linked to an attack on her many years prior. She teams with a Sun-Times reporter to investigate, but the deeper she digs the more her own reality starts to shift. Based on the book The Shining Girls by Lauren Beukes, this series may seem like just another murder mystery, but its sci-fi twists put it one step ahead.\n\nFoundation\n\nWIRED called Foundation a \u201cflawed masterpiece\u201d in our review of the first season. Considering the complexities of adapting a sprawling Isaac Asimov book series, it was high praise. Now, the dizzyingly ambitious show is back for its second season. Starring Jared Harris as Hari Seldon, a math professor who, along with his loyal followers, is exiled for predicting the oncoming end of the galactic empire that rules over them, the show often suffers under the weight of its own massive scope. But it also features wonderful performances from Lee Pace and beautiful images inspired by the James Webb Space Telescope. If you have a soft spot for big sci-fi dramas, this Game-of-Thrones-in-space wannabe is a must-watch.\n\nThe Crowded Room\n\nSet in the late 1970s, The Crowded Room stars Tom Holland as Danny Sullivan, a young man arrested after a grisly shooting in New York City. Following his arrest, this 10-episode limited series unfolds into a twisty whodunit as interrogator Rya Goodwin (Amanda Seyfried) tries to suss out what happened with the shooting and the peculiar events in Sullivan\u2019s past that may have shaped how he ended up involved. Holland told Extra that the shoot for The Crowded Room, which he also produced, \u201cbroke\u201d him, leading to him taking a yearlong hiatus from acting. Want to see why? Watch now.\n\nSilo\n\nAs WIRED's Kate Knibbs noted in the wake of Silo's release, this show is prestige sci-fi gold. Based on a dystopian book trilogy by Hugh Howey, the series focuses on a subterranean bunker\u2014the silo of the title\u2014where humanity has sequestered itself after the apocalypse. Some are hoping to win the chance to reproduce, some are trying to solve mysterious murders. Everyone watching is enjoying figuring out what's going on in this underground city\u2014and what's happening outside of it.\n\nTed Lasso\n\nOn paper, Ted Lasso sounds terrible. The inconceivable story of an American football coach who has never watched a game of soccer somehow landing himself a job as coach of a (fictional) Premier League club and trying to make up for his total lack of qualifications by being a nice guy. Sounds unwatchable, doesn\u2019t it? And yet Ted Lasso has captured the hearts and minds of viewers on both sides of the pond with its large-as-life cast and irresistibly wholesome messaging, hoovering up awards in the process. The third and final season his the streamer last year, so now is the perfect time to binge it all.\n\nHigh Desert\n\nThe Patricia Arquette\u2013aissance doesn\u2019t get as much ink as Matthew McConaughey or Keanu Reeves did during their second comings, but it\u2019s here\u2014in part thanks to the rise of streaming. Between The Act and Severance, Arquette has received some of the highest accolades of her long career recently, and High Desert seems poised to keep the award nominations coming. While coming to terms with the death of her mother, Peggy (Arquette)\u2014an addict\u2014decides she wants to pick up the pieces of her life and become a private investigator. She finds an unwitting employer/sometime mentor in Bruce Harvey (Brad Garrett), but not everyone is onboard with Peggy\u2019s career decisions\u2014namely, her straitlaced sister (Christine Taylor). It\u2019s an odd duck of a show, which is perfectly suited to Arquette\u2019s ethereal acting style, allowing her to seamlessly flit between moments of tragedy and laugh-out-loud comedy, with the audiences doing their best to keep up. The all-star cast is made even more impressive by recurring appearances from Bernadette Peters as Peggy\u2019s late mom.\n\nBig Beasts\n\nLook, Discovery doesn't get to corner the market on animal documentaries\u2014and this 10-part docuseries proves it. Featuring elephant seals, brown bears, orangutans, giant otters, and all kinds of massive mammals in between, it's the perfect thing if you just want to escape and learn a few tidbits about nature. But the best part? It's narrated by Tom Hiddleston, and there's just something charming about hearing the voice of Loki talk about a bunch of different animals he could turn himself into in the blink of an eye.\n\nShrinking\n\nDo you enjoy In Treatment but wish it was, you know, fun? Then Shrinking may be right for you. Created by Bill Lawrence and Brett Goldstein\u2014of Ted Lasso fame\u2014and Jason Segel, the show is about Jimmy (Segel), a therapist struggling to get over the death of his wife and reconnect with his daughter and patients. That may sound like a downer, and the show isn\u2019t without its harder moments, but it\u2019s buoyed by the fact that it\u2019s also a workplace comedy focusing on the therapy practice where Jimmy works alongside Harrison Ford\u2019s Paul and Jessica Williams\u2019 Gaby. Shrinking, ultimately, is about the things people do to cope, but it also features a dream team of a cast and one very memorable party scene featuring an (unrelated) vomit-soaked piano and a super-stoned Ford.\n\nServant\n\nCinematically, M. Night Shyamalan can be a little hit-or-miss, but Servant, which the filmmaker executive produces and occasionally directs, is stellar. It's about a Philadelphia couple\u2014a chef and a news anchor\u2014who lose a child only to have it mysteriously come back to life (maybe) with the arrival of their new nanny. (You really just need to watch the show for any of this to make sense.) Moody, freaky, and occasionally even funny, it'll suck you in. And now that it wrapped its fourth and final season, there\u2019s plenty to enjoy.\n\nThe Essex Serpent\n\nClaire Danes doing her best trembling-chin acting in period garb, Tom Hiddleston as a town vicar, rumors about a mysterious mythological serpent\u2014is there anything not to love about this show? No, there\u2019s not. The Essex Serpent, based on the novel by Sarah Perry, follows a recent widow (Danes) as she heads to the countryside in Essex to investigate a \u201csea dragon.\u201d There, she meets a vicar, Will (Hiddleston), who is far more skeptical of the serpent\u2019s existence. Lush and inviting, it\u2019s the ideal period mystery.\n\nSeverance\n\nOut of all the shows on this list, Severance may be the one that firmly established Apple TV+ as a streaming player with edgy prestige content. Adam Scott plays Mark, a man distraught by the death of his wife who opts to undergo Severance, a procedure that divides his memories of work from those of his life at home. He\u2019s quite happy with the setup until a former Lumon Industries coworker tracks him down when he\u2019s out-of-office, setting off a series of events that makes him question not only Severance but the work his company does. From there, it only gets more weird and bleak with each passing minute. Tense and heartbreaking, this show, the bulk of which was directed by Ben Stiller, will keep you guessing and questioning the whole way through.\n\nLittle America\n\nOriginally released when Donald Trump was still president of the United States, Little America was and remains a timely reminder of what actually makes America great. Each episode of this anthology series focuses on a different story of immigrants living in America. From an undocumented high school student who discovers a talent for squash to a \u201cbra whisperer\u201d in Brooklyn, every one of these 30-minute vignettes\u2014all of them based on real people\u2014is inspiring and important viewing.\n\nMythic Quest\n\nAn all-too-rare example of a video game TV show that really works, Mythic Quest is one of the best new workplace comedies of the past few years. Presented in perfectly bingeable half-hour episodes, the show follows a fictional game studio known for its World of Warcraft\u2013like MMO, Mythic Quest, as the people who make it slalom through their many quirky relationships. The writing is excellent, consistently funny and emotionally impactful when you least expect it, and the show manages to confront real issues in the industry without sacrificing laughs.\n\nDickinson\n\nHailee Steinfeld is a riotous young Emily Dickinson in this half-hour show from creator Alena Smith. It was part of the original Apple TV+ lineup and quickly distinguished itself thanks to its off-kilter vision of 19th-century Amherst, Massachusetts. The first season is a set of sharp, surreal vignettes, inspired by Dickinson's work and tracing the imagined life of the young poet, who is rebelling against her father, the town's societal rules, and just about everything else. The second and third seasons go deeper, examining not only the poet's life, but also the roles that race, gender, sexuality, and class played in the early days of America. If you're a Dickinson stan, love a bit of smart queer dramedy, or just have a penchant for a modern soundtrack in a Civil War\u2013era show, you\u2019ll dig this.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast', 'Angela Watercutter', 'Wired Staff', 'Eric Ravenscraft', 'Jennifer M.

While coming to terms with the death of her mother, Peggy (Arquette)\u2014an addict\u2014decides she wants to pick up the pieces of her life and become a private investigator. She finds an unwitting employer/sometime mentor in Bruce Harvey (Brad Garrett), but not everyone is onboard with Peggy\u2019s career decisions\u2014namely, her straitlaced sister (Christine Taylor). It\u2019s an odd duck of a show, which is perfectly suited to Arquette\u2019s ethereal acting style, allowing her to seamlessly flit between moments of tragedy and laugh-out-loud comedy, with the audiences doing their best to keep up. The all-star cast is made even more impressive by recurring appearances from Bernadette Peters as Peggy\u2019s late mom.\n\nBig Beasts\n\nLook, Discovery doesn't get to corner the market on animal documentaries\u2014and this 10-part docuseries proves it. Featuring elephant seals, brown bears, orangutans, giant otters, and all kinds of massive mammals in between, it's the perfect thing if you just want to escape and learn a few tidbits about nature. But the best part? It's narrated by Tom Hiddleston, and there's just something charming about hearing the voice of Loki talk about a bunch of different animals he could turn himself into in the blink of an eye.\n\nShrinking\n\nDo you enjoy In Treatment but wish it was, you know, fun? Then Shrinking may be right for you. Created by Bill Lawrence and Brett Goldstein\u2014of Ted Lasso fame\u2014and Jason Segel, the show is about Jimmy (Segel), a therapist struggling to get over the death of his wife and reconnect with his daughter and patients. That may sound like a downer, and the show isn\u2019t without its harder moments, but it\u2019s buoyed by the fact that it\u2019s also a workplace comedy focusing on the therapy practice where Jimmy works alongside Harrison Ford\u2019s Paul and Jessica Williams\u2019 Gaby. Shrinking, ultimately, is about the things people do to cope, but it also features a dream team of a cast and one very memorable party scene featuring an (unrelated) vomit-soaked piano and a super-stoned Ford.\n\nServant\n\nCinematically, M. Night Shyamalan can be a little hit-or-miss, but Servant, which the filmmaker executive produces and occasionally directs, is stellar. It's about a Philadelphia couple\u2014a chef and a news anchor\u2014who lose a child only to have it mysteriously come back to life (maybe) with the arrival of their new nanny. (You really just need to watch the show for any of this to make sense.) Moody, freaky, and occasionally even funny, it'll suck you in. And now that it wrapped its fourth and final season, there\u2019s plenty to enjoy.\n\nThe Essex Serpent\n\nClaire Danes doing her best trembling-chin acting in period garb, Tom Hiddleston as a town vicar, rumors about a mysterious mythological serpent\u2014is there anything not to love about this show? No, there\u2019s not. The Essex Serpent, based on the novel by Sarah Perry, follows a recent widow (Danes) as she heads to the countryside in Essex to investigate a \u201csea dragon.\u201d There, she meets a vicar, Will (Hiddleston), who is far more skeptical of the serpent\u2019s existence. Lush and inviting, it\u2019s the ideal period mystery.\n\nSeverance\n\nOut of all the shows on this list, Severance may be the one that firmly established Apple TV+ as a streaming player with edgy prestige content. Adam Scott plays Mark, a man distraught by the death of his wife who opts to undergo Severance, a procedure that divides his memories of work from those of his life at home. He\u2019s quite happy with the setup until a former Lumon Industries coworker tracks him down when he\u2019s out-of-office, setting off a series of events that makes him question not only Severance but the work his company does. From there, it only gets more weird and bleak with each passing minute. Tense and heartbreaking, this show, the bulk of which was directed by Ben Stiller, will keep you guessing and questioning the whole way through.\n\nLittle America\n\nOriginally released when Donald Trump was still president of the United States, Little America was and remains a timely reminder of what actually makes America great. Each episode of this anthology series focuses on a different story of immigrants living in America. From an undocumented high school student who discovers a talent for squash to a \u201cbra whisperer\u201d in Brooklyn, every one of these 30-minute vignettes\u2014all of them based on real people\u2014is inspiring and important viewing.\n\nMythic Quest\n\nAn all-too-rare example of a video game TV show that really works, Mythic Quest is one of the best new workplace comedies of the past few years. Presented in perfectly bingeable half-hour episodes, the show follows a fictional game studio known for its World of Warcraft\u2013like MMO, Mythic Quest, as the people who make it slalom through their many quirky relationships. The writing is excellent, consistently funny and emotionally impactful when you least expect it, and the show manages to confront real issues in the industry without sacrificing laughs.\n\nDickinson\n\nHailee Steinfeld is a riotous young Emily Dickinson in this half-hour show from creator Alena Smith. It was part of the original Apple TV+ lineup and quickly distinguished itself thanks to its off-kilter vision of 19th-century Amherst, Massachusetts. The first season is a set of sharp, surreal vignettes, inspired by Dickinson's work and tracing the imagined life of the young poet, who is rebelling against her father, the town's societal rules, and just about everything else. The second and third seasons go deeper, examining not only the poet's life, but also the roles that race, gender, sexuality, and class played in the early days of America. If you're a Dickinson stan, love a bit of smart queer dramedy, or just have a penchant for a modern soundtrack in a Civil War\u2013era show, you\u2019ll dig this.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast', 'Angela Watercutter', 'Wired Staff', 'Eric Ravenscraft', 'Jennifer M.

{"title": "The 34 Best Shows on Amazon Prime Right Now", "text": "While Netflix is busy pumping out more series than any one person could watch (probably), some of the best shows are on Amazon Prime Video. Trouble is, navigating the service\u2019s labyrinthine menus can make finding the right series a pain. We\u2019re here to help. Below are our favorite Amazon series\u2014all included with your Prime subscription.\n\nFor more viewing picks, read WIRED\u2019s guide to the best movies on Amazon Prime, the best movies on HBO\u2019s Max, and the best movies on Netflix.\n\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more.\n\nThe Boys\n\nSuperheroes are meant to represent hope and optimism\u2014the best of us, given outsize form. In The Boys, adapted from the darkly satirical comic by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, they\u2019re a reflection of humanity\u2019s worst\u2014greed and unrestrained power, marketed to a gullible public by vested corporate interests, operating without restraint and leaving a trail of bodies in their wake. Enter Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) and his associates The Boys, gleefully dispatching \u201cSupes\u201d who\u2019ve gone too far, often in extraordinarily violent ways. Unfortunately, the newly dropped fourth season finds the team in disarray, fractured by Butcher\u2019s own lies, right as the world needs them most. Arch-manipulator Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit) is close to the Oval Office, while the sadistic, psychotic Homelander (Antony Starr) is planning a superhuman uprising. Probably Amazon\u2019s goriest show, The Boys stands as a pertinent examination of the abuses of power, all wrapped in superhero drag.\n\nOuter Range\n\nOuter Range follows the Abbott family, headed up by patriarch Royal (Josh Brolin), as they battle to save their Wyoming ranch from a rival encroaching on their land. This is no homestead drama though\u2014part western, part sci-fi, the Abbotts\u2019 lives get exponentially stranger with the arrival of a mysterious drifter, Autumn (Imogen Poots), and the discovery of an inexplicable black pit on the property, a void that seems capable of catapulting people through time. A little bit Outlander, a little bit Dark, and a whole lot weird, Outer Range\u2019s first season was perhaps too much of a slow burn, but the newly arrived second season finally masters its pacing and establishes itself as a compelling genre mashup well worth your time.\n\nFallout\n\nMaybe the end of the world is the secret sauce to making a great video game adaptation\u2014between The Last of Us and now this spectacular interpretation of Bethesda's postapocalyptic RPG series, we're living in an unexpected golden era for the form. Yet unlike HBO's bleak but beautiful world, Fallout taps into the source material to craft an apocalypse with a very different feel, one dripping in cracked Americana, black comedy, razor-sharp social satire, and just a little bit of camp. Its greatest strength, though, lies in how it doesn\u2019t directly adapt any one of the core Fallout games. Instead, it perfectly channels their tone and feel, focusing on a core trio\u2014naive Lucy (Ella Purnell), born and raised in a subterranean vault; driven Maximus (Aaron Moten), a recruit in an army seeking technology from the old world; and the Ghoul (Walton Goggins), a centuries-old bounty hunter mutated into a nigh-immortal zombie when the bombs fell\u2014to showcase just how brilliantly twisted this nuclear wasteland really is.\n\nThree-Body\n\nNo, you're not on the Netflix list\u2014Prime Video has its own distinct adaptation of Cixin Liu's The Three-Body Problem. This take, originally released for Chinese audiences back in 2023, faithfully adapts Liu's award-winning novel of humanity's first contact with an almost unknowable alien species and the impact that their impending arrival on Earth has on humanity. Hopping between time periods, a galactic mystery unfurls after nanotech specialist Wang Miao (Luyi Zhang) is called in by detective Shi Qiang (Hewei Yu) to investigate a global spate of suicides among scientists, with the ominous phrase \"Physics doesn't exist\" being the only link between the deaths. Although Three-Body is a bit softer than Netflix's 3 Body Problem when dealing with some aspects of the story\u2014notably anything related to China's Cultural Revolution\u2014a hearty 30-episode run allows for far more space to explore Liu's complex themes and vast roster of characters. The pacing may take some getting used to for viewers more accustomed to western TV, and it's subtitled-only, but this C-drama is out of this world.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Smith\n\nYou likely know the concept from the name alone\u2014a married couple operate as undercover agents, blurring the lines between their personal and professional relationship. Unlike the 2005 Brad Pitt/Angelina Jolie movie, though, 2024's Mr. and Mrs. Smith does far more with the concept. Donald Glover (who cocreated this reboot) and Maya Erskine offer much more developed takes on the mysterious characters of \u201cJohn\u201d and \u201cJane\u201d Smith over the course of this eight-episode series, exploring their true identities, why they signed up for their dangerous careers, and whether their growing feelings for each other are just part of the roles they're playing. It's all backed up with plenty of Mission: Impossible\u2013style action, of course, but it\u2019s the sparkling chemistry between the show's leads that will leave you thinking, \u201cBrangelina who?\u201d\n\nBosch\n\nAdapting Michael Connelly's series of LA noir crime novels, Bosch stars Titus Welliver in the title role of Detective Hieronymus \"Harry\" Bosch. A compellingly grimy, cynical show with none of the gloss and ridiculous theatrics of NCIS and its ilk, Bosch leans into old-fashioned police work with plenty of political chicanery for good measure. Each of the seven seasons deals with its own big case, but there's an overarching one as Bosch investigates a cold case: the murder of his mother when he was a child. It doesn't redefine crime dramas, but it's paced perfectly for a solid binge as the threads of each case come together, making for a superior crime drama that any fan of the genre will enjoy.\n\nReacher\n\nAmazon has a way with action thrillers focused on military tough guys who answer to \"Jack R\"\u2014see Jack Ryan, also making this guide\u2014and this sharp adaptation of Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels continues the trend. Alan Ritchson (Titans, Fast X) stars as Reacher, a former military policeman now drifting from town to town, trying to live a quiet life but unable to avoid conflict. Season one finds him accused of a murder he didn't commit, while the newly arrived second sees Reacher drawn into a vast conspiracy when someone starts picking off the members of his old army unit of special investigators. It\u2019s pulpy at times, but bombastic action and surprisingly sharp dialog help it punch above its weight.\n\nInvincible\n\nWhen Mark Grayson inherits the incredible powers and abilities of his father, Omni-Man, he sets out to follow in his footsteps as new costumed superhero Invincible. Things do not go according to plan. After a shocking twist left the first season on a major cliffhanger\u2014save for for the rather brilliant Invincible: Atom Eve one-shot plugging the gap and revealing the origins of a key character\u2014this long-awaited return finds Mark's world upended. Now, he's trying to escape his father's shadow rather than live up to his legacy. Luckily, he's not on his own, with a new generation of heroes rising to help guard the globe. A brilliantly animated adaptation of the hit Image comic book by writer Robert Kirkman and artists Cory Walker and Ryan Ottley, Invincible's more mature take on superheroes allows it to do something Marvel's and DC's characters rarely do: grow up.\n\nThe Wheel of Time\n\nBased on Robert Jordan\u2019s sprawling novel series\u2014one so vast it makes Game of Thrones look concise\u2014this is one of Amazon\u2019s most ambitious, and expensive, series to date. The eight-episode first season follows Moiraine (Rosamund Pike), a powerful weaver of an ancient form of magic, as she gathers five unassuming young people, one of whom is destined to either save the world\u2014or destroy it. The second season ups the stakes, with ancient evils returning and new terrors rising\u2014right as the only ones who can stop them are scattered around the world. A visually stunning series that blends sumptuous location shoots with cinematic effects work, this is an epic fantasy that's improving with every episode.\n\nThe Greatest Show Never Made\n\nBack in 2002, it seemed everyone wanted to achieve the kind of celebrity that only comes from a breakout role on a reality TV show. It was the kind of social obsession that was all too easy for unscrupulous producers to abuse, as a host of young British fame-seekers found out when they threw their lives away for a show that was apparently never real. They quit jobs, abandoned homes, and severed relationships in pursuit of a promised cash prize. Decades later, this three-part documentary follows the people who were drawn into the web of \"producer\" Nikita Russian (an obvious pseudonym that should have been their first clue something was off) to explore what went wrong. Created with a mix of archive footage and bizarrely shot recreations, there's an air of unreality to the whole affair, proving once more that nothing is as strange as \"reality\" TV.\n\nGen V\n\nSpinning out of Amazon's hit The Boys, Gen V follows the next generation of supes, training their abilities at the Godolkin University School of Crimefighting. In keeping with its twisted parent show, this educational establishment is less Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters and more The Hunger Games with superpowers, as students battle for glory and a chance to join premier super-team The Seven. Lead Jaz Sinclair (Chilling Adventures of Sabrina) impresses as freshman Marie Moreau, a haemokinetic with lofty ambitions who uncovers dark secrets at the college that challenge her entire world view. Factor in all the poor life choices college students are famed for and some extremely creative (if often disgusting) superpowers, then allow for The Boys' trademark ultraviolence, and one thing's for sure\u2014the kids of Gen V are most definitely not alright.\n\nJack Ryan\n\nThere's no shortage of screen adaptations of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan books, but John Krasinski's turn as the CIA desk jockey turned field agent gets far more room to breathe than its predecessors. The prestige political thriller charts Ryan's rise from analyst to operative\u2014and beyond\u2014over four perfectly crafted seasons. The final season caps Ryan's career with his biggest challenge yet, investigating the convergence of a drug cartel and a terrorist organization set to create an unstoppable criminal enterprise, all while juggling the CIA's possible involvement in a political assassination in Nigeria. While the show hasn't been without controversies\u2014season two attracted condemnation from Venezuela's government for supposedly condoning a US invasion of the country; big yikes there\u2014its sharp writing, incredible performances, and cinematic action make it compelling viewing.\n\nI'm a Virgo\n\nA surrealist comedy with the sharp political and social edge viewers have come to expect from creator and director Boots Riley (Sorry to Bother You), I\u2019m a Virgo follows Cootie (Jharrel Jerome), a regular 19-year-old who just happens to be 13 feet tall. Raised in secrecy by Aunt Lafrancine (Carmen Ejogo) and Uncle Martisse (Mike Epps), Cootie is thrust into the limelight when his larger-than-life existence is inevitably discovered. Experiencing friendships and the outside world for the first time, gentle giant Cootie has to navigate everything from romance to the public\u2019s reaction to a giant Black man wandering around Oakland. Oh, and did we mention Cootie\u2019s idol, The Hero, a real-life superhero with an authoritarian streak that would put some of the worst offenders on The Boys to shame? Told you this was surreal. Do yourself a favor and watch the behind-the-scenes episodes too, tucked under Prime Video\u2019s \u201cExplore\u201d tab, for Riley\u2019s insight into each episode.\n\nCarnival Row\n\nThere\u2019s an element of \u201cwhat might have been\u201d about Carnival Row. Its strong first season showed huge potential, framing deeper themes of class, immigration, and race within a fantasy world where dominant humans and refugee fae live in uneasy lockstep. Sadly, the Covid-19 pandemic massively delayed its second\u2014and ultimately final\u2014season. But there\u2019s still a neat package of 18 beautifully produced episodes to enjoy for a relatively concise binge. The first season introduces human police inspector Rycroft \u201cPhilo\u201d Philostrate (Orlando Bloom) and his former lover, fae Vignette \u201cVini\u201d Stonemoss (Cara Delevingne), as a string of murders rocks the gaslit city of The Burgue. In the second, tensions erupt as the oppressed fae make a stand for their freedom\u2014putting Philo and Vini on opposing sides. With its quasi-Victoriana aesthetic and a preference for ornate character makeup and prosthetics, Carnival Row is also one of the most distinctive-looking series in recent years\u2014just make sure your TV can handle deep, dark contrast levels, as it\u2019s also one of the most literally dark shows.\n\nThe Power\n\nYou know how it is with teenagers. They feel a tingle, then suddenly sparks are flying\u2014but this isn\u2019t about first loves or misdirected crushes, but a rather more literal electricity, as young women around the world awaken to the power to generate and discharge lightning. Soon, it proves to be a gender-wide ability, with women old and young gaining The Power, a shift that soon changes social dynamics and power structures on a global scale. With a powerhouse cast fronted by Toni Collette as Seattle mayor Margot Cleary-Lopez, and Ted Lasso\u2019s Toheeb Jimoh as Tunde Ojo, a photojournalist documenting the situation as it unfolds, The Power explores the seismic shift of such a change playing out everywhere from the US to Nigeria.\n\nThe Legend of Vox Machina\n\nBawdy, gory, and absolutely not for kids, The Legend of Vox Machina began life as the hit Critical Role, in which a group of the biggest English-language voice actors in animation and gaming livestreamed their Dungeons & Dragons sessions before it evolved into its own beast. In the first season of this exquisitely animated fantasy, the show follows the eponymous Vox Machina guild\u2014a motley crew of usually drunk adventurers consisting of gunslingers, druids, and the requisite horny bard\u2014as they battle to reclaim the city of Whitestone from the monstrous Lord and Lady Briarwood. The second season ups the ante with \u201cthe worst team ever assembled\u201d fighting four apocalyptically powerful dragons. Fully accessible to long-time fans of the source material and newcomers alike, this series manages to be a love letter to D&D while poking plenty of fun at the classic RPG and transcending its origins to become one of the most original adult animated shows on Amazon.\n\nThe Rig\n\nSupernatural thriller The Rig doesn\u2019t even aspire to subtlety when it comes to ecological metaphors. In fact, they\u2019re often downright clumsy, as when one character says \u201cif you keep punching holes in the earth, eventually the earth\u2019s going to punch back.\u201d But if you can look past such clunkiness, this is an engaging piece of television. When the crew of the isolated Kinloch Bravo oil rig is cut off from civilization by a strange fog, the inexplicable deaths and equipment failures soon make it clear that this is no mere weather pattern. And as the tension and fear mount, being trapped in a glorified tin can in the North Sea drives the survivors to paranoid extremes. It\u2019s all brilliantly shot to make use of both the claustrophobic setting and the terrifying expanse of ocean around it, and the material is elevated by a phenomenal cast of Game of Thrones and Line of Duty veterans, making The Rig more than the guilty pleasure it might otherwise be.\n\nTales From the Loop\n\nDespite being a couple of years old, Tales From the Loop remains one of the most mesmerizing shows on Prime Video. Loosely based on the work of Swedish artist Simon St\u00e5lenhag, the series blurs the line between ongoing narrative and anthology as it follows the residents of Mercer, Ohio, exploring how their intersecting lives are impacted by \u201cthe Loop,\u201d an underground facility exploring experimental physics and making the impossible possible. Expect tales of frozen time, traded lives, and parallel worlds, all brought to life by a fantastic cast and directors\u2014including Andrew Stanton and Jodie Foster. But it\u2019s the visuals that really elevate this show, which captures the sublime aesthetic of St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s work and juxtaposes neofuturism and rural communities for a world that looks and feels like almost nothing else. At only eight episodes, a visit to Mercer is brief but unforgettable.\n\nThe Devil\u2019s Hour\n\nWhen Peter Capaldi, here playing mysterious criminal Gideon Shepherd, says \u201cmy perception of time is better than anyone\u2019s,\u201d it\u2019s clear that The Devil\u2019s Hour creator Tom Moran is having a little fourth-wall-breaking fun with his former Time Lord leading man. That\u2019s about as close as this gritty six-part drama gets to Doctor Who, though. Instead, this is a mix of murder mystery and thriller, topped off with a dash of the supernatural. The focus is on Lucy (Jessica Raine), an over-burdened social worker with an increasingly distant and troubled young son. Lucy wakes at exactly 3:33 am every morning, plagued by horrific visions, and her nightmares draw her into the orbit of police detective Ravi Dhillon\u2019s (Nikesh Patel) investigations of a bloody murder and a child\u2019s abduction. As she tries to figure out how the two are entangled, Lucy comes face to face with Shepherd. Raine is a phenomenally commanding lead throughout, while Capaldi's sinister performance is one of the most chilling you\u2019ll see on screen.\n\nThem\n\nThis horror anthology series, created by Little Marvin and executive-produced by Queen & Slim\u2019s Lena Waithe, sets its first season in 1950s Los Angeles and follows the Emory family as they move into an all-white neighborhood. It all goes about as well as you might expect, with Livia (Deborah Ayorinde) soon penned into their new home by the Stepford-like housewives of the area who make her life a living hell, led by ringleader Betty (Alison Pill). Outside the home, husband Henry (Ashley Thomas) faces physical assaults and harassment at work. Ayorinde and Thomas are phenomenal throughout, brilliantly portraying the mental, physical, and emotional turmoil of living under relentless threat. While the show\u2019s portrayal of the period is tense and horrifying in its own right, the layering of some truly unsettling supernatural threats make this a frequently terrifying watch.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power\n\nTapping into The Lord of the Rings creator J. R. R. Tolkien\u2019s sprawling history of Middle-earth, The Rings of Power is set millennia before the events of the core books (or films, which is really where the visual language of this adaptation comes from), detailing the major events of Tolkien\u2019s Second Age. Much of the focus is on Galadriel (Morfydd Clark) as she searches for Sauron, servant of Morgoth, but this ambitious fantasy series explores a range of events and themes, such as the fall of the island of N\u00famenor; the fractious politics between man, elves, and dwarves; and the forging of those perilous rings. While there\u2019s been no shortage of debate around Rings of Power, there\u2019s also no denying that Amazon got what it paid for with the most expensive TV show ever made\u2014this is one of the most beautiful series you\u2019ll ever lay eyes on. Whether the ongoing story nails the landing remains to be seen, but for sheer high fantasy spectacle, there\u2019s nothing better at the moment.\n\nThe Underground Railroad\n\nBased on the Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning novel by Colson Whitehead, this limited series from Moonlight director Barry Jenkins sticks pretty closely to the premise of the book. It\u2019s a work of historical fiction that takes the idea of the Underground Railroad\u2014the network of smugglers who helped escaped slaves flee the South\u2014and reimagines it as an actual subway system with trains and secretive station agents.\n\nFleabag\n\nYou\u2019re not supposed to like Fleabag. She\u2019s selfish, self-destructive, and morally bankrupt. Her family is loathsome, her lifestyle is ridiculous, and her job is a joke. Yet after watching this 12-episode series, we defy you not to love her a little. This magnificent sitcom about a Londoner (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) grappling with the death of her best friend has no filter: You\u2019ll hear her thoughts on feminism, familial tension, love, and sodomy. The first time Waller-Bridge interrupts her own dialog to shoot a disarming, conspiratorial glance to the screen, you\u2019re hooked. Season one is a smutty yet wonderful crescendo of self-destruction driven by a cast of characters that includes Fleabag\u2019s intensely awkward sister Claire (Sian Clifford), her selfish and pretentious stepmother (Olivia Colman), and her clueless father (Bill Paterson). The second season cheerfully bounds into blasphemy as she grapples with inappropriate (and reciprocated) feelings for a Catholic priest (Andrew Scott). It\u2019s shocking and immensely watchable\u2014and one of the rare cases when a series truly is as good as people say.\n\nThe Man in the High Castle\n\nThis adaptation of sci-fi master Philip K. Dick\u2019s novel about a world in which the Nazis won the Second World War was one of Amazon\u2019s first forays into original content. The world-building is stunningly done\u2014a divided, alternate-reality 1960s America never seemed so plausible\u2014but be warned: There might be just a touch too much present-day resonance for some viewers.\n\nThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\n\nWhat is a New York lady to do when she finds out her husband is having an affair with his dim-witted secretary? If Mrs. Maisel is anything to go by, the answer is to head to a dingy watering hole in your nightgown, do a little standup comedy, and get hauled away by the police after flashing the entire audience. Set in the 1950s, this fast-talking fashionista hides her new life as a comedian from her family and ex while battling sexism, bad crowds, and big competition. Rachel Brosnahan stars as Midge Maisel in this subtle nod to Joan Rivers\u2019 career. With four seasons and a host of awards and nominations to its name, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel is one of Amazon\u2019s sharpest comedies.\n\nThe Expanse\n\nHumanity now lives among the stars\u2014well, the rest of the solar system, at least. A group of antiheroes are linked by the disappearance of a wealthy political activist, and between them they must unravel what happened to her. Adding to the complexity are the political tensions between Earth, Mars, and the Belt, a group of loosely affiliated colonies between the two planets. That\u2019s just season one\u2014there are six available on Prime, and each is packed with enough daring missions, space fights, and Martian politics to keep fans of hard science fiction hooked.\n\nGood Omens\n\nFeeling battered and emotionally bruised by bleak TV dystopias and even bleaker world news? Good Omens is your shelter in the storm, and inside it\u2019s cozy, camp, and kind. Neil Gaiman has adapted his own 1990 book, cowritten with Terry Pratchett, which follows an angel (Michael Sheen) and a demon (David Tennant) as they try to stop Armageddon. The six-part event series gives fans exactly what they dreamed of from such a team. Silly stuff with Cold War overtones, extreme whimsy, and gruff British wit.\n\nGood Omens 2\n\nFour years is a long wait between seasons, but the dynamic between angel Aziraphale (Michael Sheen) and demon Crowley (David Tennant) in 2019\u2019s original Good Omens (also on this list) was so perfectly charming that barely a day has gone by without fans clamoring for more. Thankfully, the hotly anticipated second season doesn\u2019t disappoint, with the dastardly divine odd couple weaving their magic once again as they attempt to stave off yet another apocalypse. When the archangel Gabriel (Jon Hamm) goes missing from Heaven, only to show up amnesiac (and naked) at Aziraphale\u2019s homely bookshop in London, it kicks off a battle between \u201cupstairs\u201d and \u201cdownstairs.\u201d But while Gabriel\u2019s half-remembered warnings of something terrible looming frame the season, it\u2019s the exploration of the central duo\u2019s past that really delights. With plenty of flashbacks showing more of Aziraphale and Crowley\u2019s history\u2014and more than a bit of fanservice playing to the nature of their millennia-long relationship\u2014Sheen and Tennant\u2019s chemistry gets to shine so bright it dazzles. An overdue but incredibly welcome return.\n\nForever\n\nYou\u2019ll know within the first episode whether you\u2019re into this slow, a stylized miniseries from Parks & Recreation and Master of None alums Alan Yang and Matt Hubbard. It\u2019s part high-concept TV and part uncomfortable marriage drama, with a side helping of shtick from the two outrageously talented leads, Maya Rudolph and Fred Armisen. It might make you impatient at times, but Forever will stick with you if you hang on until the finale.\n\nSneaky Pete\n\nJust released from prison, Marius (Giovanni Ribisi) steals the identity of former cellmate Pete Murphy in order to hide from the dangers of his old life. On the run from a vicious debtor played by Bryan Cranston (who also jointly created the show), Marius nestles in with Pete\u2019s motley crew of estranged family, who are delighted to be reunited with their long-lost relative\u2014and enters waters just as shark-infested as those from which he\u2019s come. Over the course of three seasons, Sneaky Pete proves itself one of the finest dramas Amazon has produced yet.\n\nMozart in the Jungle\n\nA comedy-drama documenting the world of professional orchestra musicians in New York, Mozart in the Jungle is a strange beast. The series follows Hailey Rutledge (Lola Kirke), an aspiring oboist trying to build a career with the New York Symphony, and her conflicted relationship with eccentric conductor Rodrigo De Souza (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal). With a strong creative team and real-world source material in the form of professional oboist Blair Tindall\u2019s memoir Sex, Drugs, and Classical Music, the compelling and frequently hilarious show has picked up Golden Globes and Emmy Awards and proven itself one of Amazon\u2019s best exclusives.\n\nRed Oaks\n\nIn the mid-\u201980s, college student and struggling filmmaker David Myers (Craig Roberts) wants one last, great summer before facing adulthood. Unfortunately, he\u2019s stuck working at a pretentious country club and struggling to gain momentum in his life. Big dreams of making it in the film industry meet crushing reality as David navigates the demands of the club\u2019s eccentric guests\u2014from taking awkward wedding shoots to filming sex tapes for swingers clubs\u2014while also struggling to maintain his relationship with girlfriend Skye. All three seasons of this delightful period comedy are available now.\n\nVikings\n\nInspired by the real-life Viking hero and ruler Ragnar Lodbrok, Vikings is a family saga exploring the lives, epic adventures, and cultural politics of the raiders and explorers of the Dark Ages. Six seasons of the historically inspired action series are available on Amazon Prime Video, with WWE wrestler Adam \u201cEdge\u201d Copeland joining the cast in season five as the story expands to a civil war in Norway, battles in England against the Nordic invaders, and exploration of northern Africa.\n\nLore\n\nEntertaining well past Halloween, this anthology series presents \u201cthe frightening and often disturbing tales based on real people and events that have led to our modern-day myths and legends.\u201d Based on the award-winning podcast of the same name, it offers two six-episode seasons of real-world horror stories guaranteed to chill your bones.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast', 'Matt Kamen', 'Wired Staff', 'Laurence Russell', 'Angela Watercutter', 'Jennifer M.

{"title": "The 34 Best Shows on Amazon Prime Right Now", "text": "While Netflix is busy pumping out more series than any one person could watch (probably), some of the best shows are on Amazon Prime Video. Trouble is, navigating the service\u2019s labyrinthine menus can make finding the right series a pain. We\u2019re here to help.

This helps support our journalism. Learn more.\n\nThe Boys\n\nSuperheroes are meant to represent hope and optimism\u2014the best of us, given outsize form. In The Boys, adapted from the darkly satirical comic by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, they\u2019re a reflection of humanity\u2019s worst\u2014greed and unrestrained power, marketed to a gullible public by vested corporate interests, operating without restraint and leaving a trail of bodies in their wake. Enter Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) and his associates The Boys, gleefully dispatching \u201cSupes\u201d who\u2019ve gone too far, often in extraordinarily violent ways. Unfortunately, the newly dropped fourth season finds the team in disarray, fractured by Butcher\u2019s own lies, right as the world needs them most. Arch-manipulator Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit) is close to the Oval Office, while the sadistic, psychotic Homelander (Antony Starr) is planning a superhuman uprising. Probably Amazon\u2019s goriest show, The Boys stands as a pertinent examination of the abuses of power, all wrapped in superhero drag.\n\nOuter Range\n\nOuter Range follows the Abbott family, headed up by patriarch Royal (Josh Brolin), as they battle to save their Wyoming ranch from a rival encroaching on their land. This is no homestead drama though\u2014part western, part sci-fi, the Abbotts\u2019 lives get exponentially stranger with the arrival of a mysterious drifter, Autumn (Imogen Poots), and the discovery of an inexplicable black pit on the property, a void that seems capable of catapulting people through time. A little bit Outlander, a little bit Dark, and a whole lot weird, Outer Range\u2019s first season was perhaps too much of a slow burn, but the newly arrived second season finally masters its pacing and establishes itself as a compelling genre mashup well worth your time.\n\nFallout\n\nMaybe the end of the world is the secret sauce to making a great video game adaptation\u2014between The Last of Us and now this spectacular interpretation of Bethesda's postapocalyptic RPG series, we're living in an unexpected golden era for the form. Yet unlike HBO's bleak but beautiful world, Fallout taps into the source material to craft an apocalypse with a very different feel, one dripping in cracked Americana, black comedy, razor-sharp social satire, and just a little bit of camp. Its greatest strength, though, lies in how it doesn\u2019t directly adapt any one of the core Fallout games. Instead, it perfectly channels their tone and feel, focusing on a core trio\u2014naive Lucy (Ella Purnell), born and raised in a subterranean vault; driven Maximus (Aaron Moten), a recruit in an army seeking technology from the old world; and the Ghoul (Walton Goggins), a centuries-old bounty hunter mutated into a nigh-immortal zombie when the bombs fell\u2014to showcase just how brilliantly twisted this nuclear wasteland really is.\n\nThree-Body\n\nNo, you're not on the Netflix list\u2014Prime Video has its own distinct adaptation of Cixin Liu's The Three-Body Problem. This take, originally released for Chinese audiences back in 2023, faithfully adapts Liu's award-winning novel of humanity's first contact with an almost unknowable alien species and the impact that their impending arrival on Earth has on humanity. Hopping between time periods, a galactic mystery unfurls after nanotech specialist Wang Miao (Luyi Zhang) is called in by detective Shi Qiang (Hewei Yu) to investigate a global spate of suicides among scientists, with the ominous phrase \"Physics doesn't exist\" being the only link between the deaths. Although Three-Body is a bit softer than Netflix's 3 Body Problem when dealing with some aspects of the story\u2014notably anything related to China's Cultural Revolution\u2014a hearty 30-episode run allows for far more space to explore Liu's complex themes and vast roster of characters. The pacing may take some getting used to for viewers more accustomed to western TV, and it's subtitled-only, but this C-drama is out of this world.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Smith\n\nYou likely know the concept from the name alone\u2014a married couple operate as undercover agents, blurring the lines between their personal and professional relationship. Unlike the 2005 Brad Pitt/Angelina Jolie movie, though, 2024's Mr. and Mrs. Smith does far more with the concept. Donald Glover (who cocreated this reboot) and Maya Erskine offer much more developed takes on the mysterious characters of \u201cJohn\u201d and \u201cJane\u201d Smith over the course of this eight-episode series, exploring their true identities, why they signed up for their dangerous careers, and whether their growing feelings for each other are just part of the roles they're playing. It's all backed up with plenty of Mission: Impossible\u2013style action, of course, but it\u2019s the sparkling chemistry between the show's leads that will leave you thinking, \u201cBrangelina who?\u201d\n\nBosch\n\nAdapting Michael Connelly's series of LA noir crime novels, Bosch stars Titus Welliver in the title role of Detective Hieronymus \"Harry\" Bosch. A compellingly grimy, cynical show with none of the gloss and ridiculous theatrics of NCIS and its ilk, Bosch leans into old-fashioned police work with plenty of political chicanery for good measure. Each of the seven seasons deals with its own big case, but there's an overarching one as Bosch investigates a cold case: the murder of his mother when he was a child. It doesn't redefine crime dramas, but it's paced perfectly for a solid binge as the threads of each case come together, making for a superior crime drama that any fan of the genre will enjoy.\n\nReacher\n\nAmazon has a way with action thrillers focused on military tough guys who answer to \"Jack R\"\u2014see Jack Ryan, also making this guide\u2014and this sharp adaptation of Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels continues the trend. Alan Ritchson (Titans, Fast X) stars as Reacher, a former military policeman now drifting from town to town, trying to live a quiet life but unable to avoid conflict. Season one finds him accused of a murder he didn't commit, while the newly arrived second sees Reacher drawn into a vast conspiracy when someone starts picking off the members of his old army unit of special investigators. It\u2019s pulpy at times, but bombastic action and surprisingly sharp dialog help it punch above its weight.\n\nInvincible\n\nWhen Mark Grayson inherits the incredible powers and abilities of his father, Omni-Man, he sets out to follow in his footsteps as new costumed superhero Invincible. Things do not go according to plan. After a shocking twist left the first season on a major cliffhanger\u2014save for for the rather brilliant Invincible: Atom Eve one-shot plugging the gap and revealing the origins of a key character\u2014this long-awaited return finds Mark's world upended. Now, he's trying to escape his father's shadow rather than live up to his legacy. Luckily, he's not on his own, with a new generation of heroes rising to help guard the globe. A brilliantly animated adaptation of the hit Image comic book by writer Robert Kirkman and artists Cory Walker and Ryan Ottley, Invincible's more mature take on superheroes allows it to do something Marvel's and DC's characters rarely do: grow up.\n\nThe Wheel of Time\n\nBased on Robert Jordan\u2019s sprawling novel series\u2014one so vast it makes Game of Thrones look concise\u2014this is one of Amazon\u2019s most ambitious, and expensive, series to date. The eight-episode first season follows Moiraine (Rosamund Pike), a powerful weaver of an ancient form of magic, as she gathers five unassuming young people, one of whom is destined to either save the world\u2014or destroy it. The second season ups the stakes, with ancient evils returning and new terrors rising\u2014right as the only ones who can stop them are scattered around the world. A visually stunning series that blends sumptuous location shoots with cinematic effects work, this is an epic fantasy that's improving with every episode.\n\nThe Greatest Show Never Made\n\nBack in 2002, it seemed everyone wanted to achieve the kind of celebrity that only comes from a breakout role on a reality TV show. It was the kind of social obsession that was all too easy for unscrupulous producers to abuse, as a host of young British fame-seekers found out when they threw their lives away for a show that was apparently never real. They quit jobs, abandoned homes, and severed relationships in pursuit of a promised cash prize. Decades later, this three-part documentary follows the people who were drawn into the web of \"producer\" Nikita Russian (an obvious pseudonym that should have been their first clue something was off) to explore what went wrong. Created with a mix of archive footage and bizarrely shot recreations, there's an air of unreality to the whole affair, proving once more that nothing is as strange as \"reality\" TV.\n\nGen V\n\nSpinning out of Amazon's hit The Boys, Gen V follows the next generation of supes, training their abilities at the Godolkin University School of Crimefighting. In keeping with its twisted parent show, this educational establishment is less Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters and more The Hunger Games with superpowers, as students battle for glory and a chance to join premier super-team The Seven. Lead Jaz Sinclair (Chilling Adventures of Sabrina) impresses as freshman Marie Moreau, a haemokinetic with lofty ambitions who uncovers dark secrets at the college that challenge her entire world view. Factor in all the poor life choices college students are famed for and some extremely creative (if often disgusting) superpowers, then allow for The Boys' trademark ultraviolence, and one thing's for sure\u2014the kids of Gen V are most definitely not alright.\n\nJack Ryan\n\nThere's no shortage of screen adaptations of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan books, but John Krasinski's turn as the CIA desk jockey turned field agent gets far more room to breathe than its predecessors. The prestige political thriller charts Ryan's rise from analyst to operative\u2014and beyond\u2014over four perfectly crafted seasons. The final season caps Ryan's career with his biggest challenge yet, investigating the convergence of a drug cartel and a terrorist organization set to create an unstoppable criminal enterprise, all while juggling the CIA's possible involvement in a political assassination in Nigeria. While the show hasn't been without controversies\u2014season two attracted condemnation from Venezuela's government for supposedly condoning a US invasion of the country; big yikes there\u2014its sharp writing, incredible performances, and cinematic action make it compelling viewing.\n\nI'm a Virgo\n\nA surrealist comedy with the sharp political and social edge viewers have come to expect from creator and director Boots Riley (Sorry to Bother You), I\u2019m a Virgo follows Cootie (Jharrel Jerome), a regular 19-year-old who just happens to be 13 feet tall. Raised in secrecy by Aunt Lafrancine (Carmen Ejogo) and Uncle Martisse (Mike Epps), Cootie is thrust into the limelight when his larger-than-life existence is inevitably discovered. Experiencing friendships and the outside world for the first time, gentle giant Cootie has to navigate everything from romance to the public\u2019s reaction to a giant Black man wandering around Oakland. Oh, and did we mention Cootie\u2019s idol, The Hero, a real-life superhero with an authoritarian streak that would put some of the worst offenders on The Boys to shame? Told you this was surreal. Do yourself a favor and watch the behind-the-scenes episodes too, tucked under Prime Video\u2019s \u201cExplore\u201d tab, for Riley\u2019s insight into each episode.\n\nCarnival Row\n\nThere\u2019s an element of \u201cwhat might have been\u201d about Carnival Row. Its strong first season showed huge potential, framing deeper themes of class, immigration, and race within a fantasy world where dominant humans and refugee fae live in uneasy lockstep. Sadly, the Covid-19 pandemic massively delayed its second\u2014and ultimately final\u2014season. But there\u2019s still a neat package of 18 beautifully produced episodes to enjoy for a relatively concise binge. The first season introduces human police inspector Rycroft \u201cPhilo\u201d Philostrate (Orlando Bloom) and his former lover, fae Vignette \u201cVini\u201d Stonemoss (Cara Delevingne), as a string of murders rocks the gaslit city of The Burgue. In the second, tensions erupt as the oppressed fae make a stand for their freedom\u2014putting Philo and Vini on opposing sides. With its quasi-Victoriana aesthetic and a preference for ornate character makeup and prosthetics, Carnival Row is also one of the most distinctive-looking series in recent years\u2014just make sure your TV can handle deep, dark contrast levels, as it\u2019s also one of the most literally dark shows.\n\nThe Power\n\nYou know how it is with teenagers. They feel a tingle, then suddenly sparks are flying\u2014but this isn\u2019t about first loves or misdirected crushes, but a rather more literal electricity, as young women around the world awaken to the power to generate and discharge lightning. Soon, it proves to be a gender-wide ability, with women old and young gaining The Power, a shift that soon changes social dynamics and power structures on a global scale. With a powerhouse cast fronted by Toni Collette as Seattle mayor Margot Cleary-Lopez, and Ted Lasso\u2019s Toheeb Jimoh as Tunde Ojo, a photojournalist documenting the situation as it unfolds, The Power explores the seismic shift of such a change playing out everywhere from the US to Nigeria.\n\nThe Legend of Vox Machina\n\nBawdy, gory, and absolutely not for kids, The Legend of Vox Machina began life as the hit Critical Role, in which a group of the biggest English-language voice actors in animation and gaming livestreamed their Dungeons & Dragons sessions before it evolved into its own beast. In the first season of this exquisitely animated fantasy, the show follows the eponymous Vox Machina guild\u2014a motley crew of usually drunk adventurers consisting of gunslingers, druids, and the requisite horny bard\u2014as they battle to reclaim the city of Whitestone from the monstrous Lord and Lady Briarwood. The second season ups the ante with \u201cthe worst team ever assembled\u201d fighting four apocalyptically powerful dragons. Fully accessible to long-time fans of the source material and newcomers alike, this series manages to be a love letter to D&D while poking plenty of fun at the classic RPG and transcending its origins to become one of the most original adult animated shows on Amazon.\n\nThe Rig\n\nSupernatural thriller The Rig doesn\u2019t even aspire to subtlety when it comes to ecological metaphors. In fact, they\u2019re often downright clumsy, as when one character says \u201cif you keep punching holes in the earth, eventually the earth\u2019s going to punch back.\u201d But if you can look past such clunkiness, this is an engaging piece of television. When the crew of the isolated Kinloch Bravo oil rig is cut off from civilization by a strange fog, the inexplicable deaths and equipment failures soon make it clear that this is no mere weather pattern. And as the tension and fear mount, being trapped in a glorified tin can in the North Sea drives the survivors to paranoid extremes. It\u2019s all brilliantly shot to make use of both the claustrophobic setting and the terrifying expanse of ocean around it, and the material is elevated by a phenomenal cast of Game of Thrones and Line of Duty veterans, making The Rig more than the guilty pleasure it might otherwise be.\n\nTales From the Loop\n\nDespite being a couple of years old, Tales From the Loop remains one of the most mesmerizing shows on Prime Video. Loosely based on the work of Swedish artist Simon St\u00e5lenhag, the series blurs the line between ongoing narrative and anthology as it follows the residents of Mercer, Ohio, exploring how their intersecting lives are impacted by \u201cthe Loop,\u201d an underground facility exploring experimental physics and making the impossible possible. Expect tales of frozen time, traded lives, and parallel worlds, all brought to life by a fantastic cast and directors\u2014including Andrew Stanton and Jodie Foster. But it\u2019s the visuals that really elevate this show, which captures the sublime aesthetic of St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s work and juxtaposes neofuturism and rural communities for a world that looks and feels like almost nothing else. At only eight episodes, a visit to Mercer is brief but unforgettable.\n\nThe Devil\u2019s Hour\n\nWhen Peter Capaldi, here playing mysterious criminal Gideon Shepherd, says \u201cmy perception of time is better than anyone\u2019s,\u201d it\u2019s clear that The Devil\u2019s Hour creator Tom Moran is having a little fourth-wall-breaking fun with his former Time Lord leading man. That\u2019s about as close as this gritty six-part drama gets to Doctor Who, though. Instead, this is a mix of murder mystery and thriller, topped off with a dash of the supernatural. The focus is on Lucy (Jessica Raine), an over-burdened social worker with an increasingly distant and troubled young son. Lucy wakes at exactly 3:33 am every morning, plagued by horrific visions, and her nightmares draw her into the orbit of police detective Ravi Dhillon\u2019s (Nikesh Patel) investigations of a bloody murder and a child\u2019s abduction. As she tries to figure out how the two are entangled, Lucy comes face to face with Shepherd. Raine is a phenomenally commanding lead throughout, while Capaldi's sinister performance is one of the most chilling you\u2019ll see on screen.\n\nThem\n\nThis horror anthology series, created by Little Marvin and executive-produced by Queen & Slim\u2019s Lena Waithe, sets its first season in 1950s Los Angeles and follows the Emory family as they move into an all-white neighborhood. It all goes about as well as you might expect, with Livia (Deborah Ayorinde) soon penned into their new home by the Stepford-like housewives of the area who make her life a living hell, led by ringleader Betty (Alison Pill). Outside the home, husband Henry (Ashley Thomas) faces physical assaults and harassment at work. Ayorinde and Thomas are phenomenal throughout, brilliantly portraying the mental, physical, and emotional turmoil of living under relentless threat. While the show\u2019s portrayal of the period is tense and horrifying in its own right, the layering of some truly unsettling supernatural threats make this a frequently terrifying watch.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power\n\nTapping into The Lord of the Rings creator J. R. R. Tolkien\u2019s sprawling history of Middle-earth, The Rings of Power is set millennia before the events of the core books (or films, which is really where the visual language of this adaptation comes from), detailing the major events of Tolkien\u2019s Second Age. Much of the focus is on Galadriel (Morfydd Clark) as she searches for Sauron, servant of Morgoth, but this ambitious fantasy series explores a range of events and themes, such as the fall of the island of N\u00famenor; the fractious politics between man, elves, and dwarves; and the forging of those perilous rings. While there\u2019s been no shortage of debate around Rings of Power, there\u2019s also no denying that Amazon got what it paid for with the most expensive TV show ever made\u2014this is one of the most beautiful series you\u2019ll ever lay eyes on. Whether the ongoing story nails the landing remains to be seen, but for sheer high fantasy spectacle, there\u2019s nothing better at the moment.\n\nThe Underground Railroad\n\nBased on the Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning novel by Colson Whitehead, this limited series from Moonlight director Barry Jenkins sticks pretty closely to the premise of the book. It\u2019s a work of historical fiction that takes the idea of the Underground Railroad\u2014the network of smugglers who helped escaped slaves flee the South\u2014and reimagines it as an actual subway system with trains and secretive station agents.\n\nFleabag\n\nYou\u2019re not supposed to like Fleabag. She\u2019s selfish, self-destructive, and morally bankrupt. Her family is loathsome, her lifestyle is ridiculous, and her job is a joke. Yet after watching this 12-episode series, we defy you not to love her a little. This magnificent sitcom about a Londoner (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) grappling with the death of her best friend has no filter: You\u2019ll hear her thoughts on feminism, familial tension, love, and sodomy. The first time Waller-Bridge interrupts her own dialog to shoot a disarming, conspiratorial glance to the screen, you\u2019re hooked. Season one is a smutty yet wonderful crescendo of self-destruction driven by a cast of characters that includes Fleabag\u2019s intensely awkward sister Claire (Sian Clifford), her selfish and pretentious stepmother (Olivia Colman), and her clueless father (Bill Paterson). The second season cheerfully bounds into blasphemy as she grapples with inappropriate (and reciprocated) feelings for a Catholic priest (Andrew Scott). It\u2019s shocking and immensely watchable\u2014and one of the rare cases when a series truly is as good as people say.\n\nThe Man in the High Castle\n\nThis adaptation of sci-fi master Philip K. Dick\u2019s novel about a world in which the Nazis won the Second World War was one of Amazon\u2019s first forays into original content. The world-building is stunningly done\u2014a divided, alternate-reality 1960s America never seemed so plausible\u2014but be warned: There might be just a touch too much present-day resonance for some viewers.\n\nThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\n\nWhat is a New York lady to do when she finds out her husband is having an affair with his dim-witted secretary? If Mrs. Maisel is anything to go by, the answer is to head to a dingy watering hole in your nightgown, do a little standup comedy, and get hauled away by the police after flashing the entire audience. Set in the 1950s, this fast-talking fashionista hides her new life as a comedian from her family and ex while battling sexism, bad crowds, and big competition. Rachel Brosnahan stars as Midge Maisel in this subtle nod to Joan Rivers\u2019 career. With four seasons and a host of awards and nominations to its name, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel is one of Amazon\u2019s sharpest comedies.\n\nThe Expanse\n\nHumanity now lives among the stars\u2014well, the rest of the solar system, at least. A group of antiheroes are linked by the disappearance of a wealthy political activist, and between them they must unravel what happened to her. Adding to the complexity are the political tensions between Earth, Mars, and the Belt, a group of loosely affiliated colonies between the two planets. That\u2019s just season one\u2014there are six available on Prime, and each is packed with enough daring missions, space fights, and Martian politics to keep fans of hard science fiction hooked.\n\nGood Omens\n\nFeeling battered and emotionally bruised by bleak TV dystopias and even bleaker world news? Good Omens is your shelter in the storm, and inside it\u2019s cozy, camp, and kind. Neil Gaiman has adapted his own 1990 book, cowritten with Terry Pratchett, which follows an angel (Michael Sheen) and a demon (David Tennant) as they try to stop Armageddon. The six-part event series gives fans exactly what they dreamed of from such a team. Silly stuff with Cold War overtones, extreme whimsy, and gruff British wit.\n\nGood Omens 2\n\nFour years is a long wait between seasons, but the dynamic between angel Aziraphale (Michael Sheen) and demon Crowley (David Tennant) in 2019\u2019s original Good Omens (also on this list) was so perfectly charming that barely a day has gone by without fans clamoring for more. Thankfully, the hotly anticipated second season doesn\u2019t disappoint, with the dastardly divine odd couple weaving their magic once again as they attempt to stave off yet another apocalypse. When the archangel Gabriel (Jon Hamm) goes missing from Heaven, only to show up amnesiac (and naked) at Aziraphale\u2019s homely bookshop in London, it kicks off a battle between \u201cupstairs\u201d and \u201cdownstairs.\u201d But while Gabriel\u2019s half-remembered warnings of something terrible looming frame the season, it\u2019s the exploration of the central duo\u2019s past that really delights. With plenty of flashbacks showing more of Aziraphale and Crowley\u2019s history\u2014and more than a bit of fanservice playing to the nature of their millennia-long relationship\u2014Sheen and Tennant\u2019s chemistry gets to shine so bright it dazzles. An overdue but incredibly welcome return.\n\nForever\n\nYou\u2019ll know within the first episode whether you\u2019re into this slow, a stylized miniseries from Parks & Recreation and Master of None alums Alan Yang and Matt Hubbard. It\u2019s part high-concept TV and part uncomfortable marriage drama, with a side helping of shtick from the two outrageously talented leads, Maya Rudolph and Fred Armisen. It might make you impatient at times, but Forever will stick with you if you hang on until the finale.\n\nSneaky Pete\n\nJust released from prison, Marius (Giovanni Ribisi) steals the identity of former cellmate Pete Murphy in order to hide from the dangers of his old life. On the run from a vicious debtor played by Bryan Cranston (who also jointly created the show), Marius nestles in with Pete\u2019s motley crew of estranged family, who are delighted to be reunited with their long-lost relative\u2014and enters waters just as shark-infested as those from which he\u2019s come. Over the course of three seasons, Sneaky Pete proves itself one of the finest dramas Amazon has produced yet.\n\nMozart in the Jungle\n\nA comedy-drama documenting the world of professional orchestra musicians in New York, Mozart in the Jungle is a strange beast. The series follows Hailey Rutledge (Lola Kirke), an aspiring oboist trying to build a career with the New York Symphony, and her conflicted relationship with eccentric conductor Rodrigo De Souza (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal). With a strong creative team and real-world source material in the form of professional oboist Blair Tindall\u2019s memoir Sex, Drugs, and Classical Music, the compelling and frequently hilarious show has picked up Golden Globes and Emmy Awards and proven itself one of Amazon\u2019s best exclusives.\n\nRed Oaks\n\nIn the mid-\u201980s, college student and struggling filmmaker David Myers (Craig Roberts) wants one last, great summer before facing adulthood. Unfortunately, he\u2019s stuck working at a pretentious country club and struggling to gain momentum in his life. Big dreams of making it in the film industry meet crushing reality as David navigates the demands of the club\u2019s eccentric guests\u2014from taking awkward wedding shoots to filming sex tapes for swingers clubs\u2014while also struggling to maintain his relationship with girlfriend Skye. All three seasons of this delightful period comedy are available now.\n\nVikings\n\nInspired by the real-life Viking hero and ruler Ragnar Lodbrok, Vikings is a family saga exploring the lives, epic adventures, and cultural politics of the raiders and explorers of the Dark Ages. Six seasons of the historically inspired action series are available on Amazon Prime Video, with WWE wrestler Adam \u201cEdge\u201d Copeland joining the cast in season five as the story expands to a civil war in Norway, battles in England against the Nordic invaders, and exploration of northern Africa.\n\nLore\n\nEntertaining well past Halloween, this anthology series presents \u201cthe frightening and often disturbing tales based on real people and events that have led to our modern-day myths and legends.\u201d Based on the award-winning podcast of the same name, it offers two six-episode seasons of real-world horror stories guaranteed to chill your bones.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast', 'Matt Kamen', 'Wired Staff', 'Laurence Russell', 'Angela Watercutter', 'Jennifer M.

I did.\n\nI watched The Clone Wars\n\nwhen I was coming back to Star Wars\n\nto get ready for the Obi-Wan Kenobi show.\n\nI was just sort of reimmersing myself\n\nin all things Star Wars.\n\nAnd I thought they did a great job with these characters\n\nand brought in some new characters.\n\nAnd really great storytelling.\n\nHow did Hayden Christensen\n\nget the role of Anakin Skywalker?\n\nI auditioned for it.\n\nLike, a lot of other people\n\nI went in and I met with the casting director first.\n\nAnd then I went to the Skywalker Ranch\n\nand I got to meet with George Lucas, which was thrilling.\n\nAnd then I got to go back to the Skywalker Ranch\n\nand I auditioned with Natalie Portman.\n\nMaybe a few days later,\n\nI got one of the best phone calls of my life,\n\nsaying that I got the part.\n\nJust a lot of training to figure out the lightsaber stuff.\n\nYou know, they knew that I had some athletic inclinations.\n\nI played a lot of hockey and tennis as a kid,\n\nso I thought maybe I'd be able\n\nto pick up a lightsaber and handle myself.\n\nBut it was a lot of time spent with Nick Gillard,\n\nthe fight choreographer of the prequels.\n\nAnd that was some of my favorite stuff was, you know,\n\ngoing to Jedi training camp\n\nand learning how to fight with a lightsaber.\n\nWhen did Hayden Christensen play Darth Vader?\n\nI played Darth Vader when we did Revenge of the Sith,\n\nvery briefly at the end of that film.\n\nAnd then I got to play him again when we came back\n\nto do the Obi-Wan Kenobi show just recently.\n\nIt was a great thrill, you know.\n\nI'd spent a lot of time playing Anakin,\n\nbut to get to sort of spend some time as Darth Vader\n\nwas a nice continuation of my journey with the character.\n\nWill Hayden Christensen play Anakin again?\n\nThat would be a lot of fun.\n\nI think that the answer to that question remains to be seen.\n\nAll right.\n\nDoes Hayden Christensen go to conventions?\n\nI have started going to conventions.\n\nI didn't for a while. And then I did and I enjoyed it.\n\nAnd I had fun and so now I go every now and then when I can.\n\nDoes Hayden Christensen have social media?\n\nI do not have any social media.\n\nNever say never. Maybe one day.\n\nDid Hayden Christensen like playing Anakin Skywalker?\n\nIs this, yeah, Skywalker.\n\nI did. I loved playing Anakin Skywalker.\n\nJust getting to play a Jedi Knight was so much fun.\n\nPutting that costume on every day\n\nand having a lightsaber hang from your belt\n\nwas a pretty cool thing.\n\nAnd just to play the character that becomes Darth Vader.\n\nHe's got a lot of sort of, you know,\n\ninner conflict and lots of emotions.\n\nHe's always dealing with, you know,\n\nthere's a lot going on underneath the surface.\n\nProbably one of my favorite roles I've ever gotten to play.\n\nI love the character, I love Star Wars,\n\nso yeah, I definitely did.\n\nDoes Hayden Christensen play video games?\n\nI used to play a lot of video games.\n\nNot so much anymore, ever since I became a dad.\n\nI was big into Call of Duty, Halo, and then FIFA.\n\nFIFA was kind of my go-to.\n\nManchester United was the team I usually played with.\n\nDoes Hayden Christensen have any tattoos?\n\nNo. No, I don't have any tattoos.\n\nToo indecisive to commit to a tattoo.\n\nAlright. Is Hayden Christensen Mark Hamill's nephew?\n\nNo, I'm not related to Mark Hamill, in any way.\n\nI've met him a couple times. Great guy.\n\nBut yeah, we are not related.\n\nIs Hayden Christensen a farmer?\n\nNo, I'm not. I'm not actually a farmer.\n\nI do have a farm, or it was a working farm when I bought it,\n\nbut I stopped farming the land.\n\nSo I'm not really a farmer, although I do own a tractor.\n\nI don't know who really owns a tractor other than a farmer,\n\nso it's a gray area.\n\nIs Hayden Christensen a footballer?\n\nNo, not a footballer. I played when I was a little kid.\n\nAnd then I played in a charity match, called Soccer Aid.\n\nAnd I think if you go online\n\nyou can see a video of probably the exact moment\n\nwhen I lost the soccer game for my team.\n\nIt was a close game, it was a tied game,\n\nand then it went to a penalty shootout.\n\nAnd when I went up to do mine,\n\nit just didn't go very well.\n\nAnd the coach actually, his one bit of advice to me\n\nwas to keep it on the ground.\n\nAnd then I went up to strike the ball.\n\nAnd I was just like, I'm gonna give it everything I've got.\n\nAnd I nailed the sucker,\n\nand it just went flying over the net, which is probably\n\nlike a very Anakin thing to do when you think about it.\n\nIs Hayden Christensen CGI in 'Ahsoka?'\n\nNo, I was actually there. That was me.\n\nI was digitally de-aged a little bit,\n\nbut not a computer generated image.\n\nIs Hayden Christensen in 'Rise of Skywalker?'\n\nNo, but my voice is very briefly if you listen closely.\n\nIs Hayden Christensen Danish?\n\nNo, I'm part Swedish. My last name is Danish.\n\nI don't really know how that happened,\n\nbut no, I'm a bit of part Swedish, part Italian,\n\nand then part like English, Irish, Scottish, something.\n\nSort of hard to track.\n\nThat's the end of that one. All right.\n\nWhat was Hayden Christensen's first movie?\n\nMy first movie was a John Carpenter film\n\ncalled In The Mouth of Madness.\n\nI was maybe 12 or 13 at the time. And I was in one scene.\n\nI played a paper boy and it was with Sam Neil.\n\nAnd I was so excited\n\n'cause it was just after Jurassic Park had came out.\n\nAnd so I was really excited\n\nto get to be in a movie with him.\n\nI think I was giving Sam Neil directions.\n\nBoth he and and John Carpenter were very kind people.\n\nAnd I remember John Carpenter\n\ngave me a gift basket at the end of the day.\n\nAnd a very nice hand handwritten card,\n\nwhich I think I still have somewhere.\n\nWhat is Hayden Christensen's favorite song?\n\nI don't know that I have a favorite song.\n\nIt's hard to pick just one.\n\nWhen I was a kid,\n\nlike, if you ask me when I was like nine or 10 years old,\n\nI would've said Great Balls of Fire by Jerry Lee Lewis.\n\nIt was one of the first songs\n\nI learned to play on the piano.\n\nAnd I performed at a family member's wedding one time\n\nwhen I was quite young.\n\nAnd then I also used to really love\n\nFaith by George Michael.\n\nAnytime that came on the radio,\n\nwhen I was like driving the car with my mom,\n\nI used to rock out to that song.\n\nWhat school did Hayden Christensen go to?\n\nI went to Unionville High School in Ontario, Canada.\n\nAnd it was a really good school.\n\nIt was a public school, but it had an arts program\n\nwithin the sort of mainstream high school.\n\nAnd I went to the theater program there.\n\nAnd we did like half a year studying Shakespeare,\n\nand I got to play Hamlet.\n\nI really sort of connected with the role.\n\nAnd that was definitely a moment for me\n\nwhere I thought like, this would be something\n\nI'd really like to continue with\n\nand maybe try to make a profession out of.\n\nFor sure, there's lots of comparisons\n\nyou can make to Hamlet and Anakin.\n\nThey're both very sort of impulsive characters\n\nwho tend to sort of act before they think.\n\nI've certainly been accused of that myself too.\n\nBut yeah, there's lots of similarities there.\n\nMaybe that helped me in my pursuit of playing Anakin.\n\nWhat languages does Hayden Christensen speak?\n\nSadly, I really only speak English.\n\nI wish I was multilingual.\n\nBut I can speak a little bit of French, not very well.\n\nBut in Canada it's, you know,\n\na part of the sort of mandatory curriculum\n\nthat you study French up until grade nine.\n\nAnd then after grade nine I didn't continue with it.\n\nI'd be able to fake my way\n\nthrough ordering at a French restaurant.\n\nBut as soon as I get into a conversation with someone,\n\nthen they pretty quickly realize that it's not a language\n\nI should really be communicating in.\n\nBonjour, comment ca va? All right, next up.\n\nHow old was Hayden Christensen\n\nduring 'Revenge of the Sith?'\n\nI think I was about 22 years old\n\nwhen I did Revenge of the Sith\n\nor when we started the filming on those.\n\nWould go on for a couple of years,\n\nso I was probably 22, 23 when I did that.\n\nWhere is Hayden Christensen from?\n\nI'm from Canada. I was born in Vancouver, Canada.\n\nAnd then my family moved to Toronto\n\nwhen I was like five years old.\n\nAnd I grew up in the suburbs of Toronto.\n\nAre Hayden Christensen Ewan McGregor friends?\n\nYeah. Yeah, we are friends. I love Ewan.\n\nHe's a great guy, great actor.\n\nAnd it was so nice to get to come back\n\nand do the Obi-Wan show with him.\n\nAnd now we see each other every now and then,\n\nand it's been really nice.\n\nSo yes, we are friends.\n\nCan Hayden Christensen play the piano?\n\nYeah. Yeah, I can play the piano.\n\nI took a lot of piano lessons when I was a kid\n\nand I learned how to play sort of jazz and blues,\n\nwhich was my interest.\n\nI can't read any, you know, sheet music or anything,\n\nbut I can sit down and have some fun at the piano.\n\nThere's a lot of people don't know about me,\n\nsome interesting things to be curious about.\n\nThank you Wired. This was fun.\n\nI hope you learned something.

And I was in one scene.\n\nI played a paper boy and it was with Sam Neil.\n\nAnd I was so excited\n\n'cause it was just after Jurassic Park had came out.\n\nAnd so I was really excited\n\nto get to be in a movie with him.\n\nI think I was giving Sam Neil directions.\n\nBoth he and and John Carpenter were very kind people.\n\nAnd I remember John Carpenter\n\ngave me a gift basket at the end of the day.\n\nAnd a very nice hand handwritten card,\n\nwhich I think I still have somewhere.\n\nWhat is Hayden Christensen's favorite song?\n\nI don't know that I have a favorite song.\n\nIt's hard to pick just one.\n\nWhen I was a kid,\n\nlike, if you ask me when I was like nine or 10 years old,\n\nI would've said Great Balls of Fire by Jerry Lee Lewis.\n\nIt was one of the first songs\n\nI learned to play on the piano.\n\nAnd I performed at a family member's wedding one time\n\nwhen I was quite young.\n\nAnd then I also used to really love\n\nFaith by George Michael.\n\nAnytime that came on the radio,\n\nwhen I was like driving the car with my mom,\n\nI used to rock out to that song.\n\nWhat school did Hayden Christensen go to?\n\nI went to Unionville High School in Ontario, Canada.\n\nAnd it was a really good school.\n\nIt was a public school, but it had an arts program\n\nwithin the sort of mainstream high school.\n\nAnd I went to the theater program there.\n\nAnd we did like half a year studying Shakespeare,\n\nand I got to play Hamlet.\n\nI really sort of connected with the role.\n\nAnd that was definitely a moment for me\n\nwhere I thought like, this would be something\n\nI'd really like to continue with\n\nand maybe try to make a profession out of.\n\nFor sure, there's lots of comparisons\n\nyou can make to Hamlet and Anakin.\n\nThey're both very sort of impulsive characters\n\nwho tend to sort of act before they think.\n\nI've certainly been accused of that myself too.\n\nBut yeah, there's lots of similarities there.\n\nMaybe that helped me in my pursuit of playing Anakin.\n\nWhat languages does Hayden Christensen speak?\n\nSadly, I really only speak English.\n\nI wish I was multilingual.\n\nBut I can speak a little bit of French, not very well.\n\nBut in Canada it's, you know,\n\na part of the sort of mandatory curriculum\n\nthat you study French up until grade nine.\n\nAnd then after grade nine I didn't continue with it.\n\nI'd be able to fake my way\n\nthrough ordering at a French restaurant.\n\nBut as soon as I get into a conversation with someone,\n\nthen they pretty quickly realize that it's not a language\n\nI should really be communicating in.\n\nBonjour, comment ca va? All right, next up.\n\nHow old was Hayden Christensen\n\nduring 'Revenge of the Sith?'\n\nI think I was about 22 years old\n\nwhen I did Revenge of the Sith\n\nor when we started the filming on those.\n\nWould go on for a couple of years,\n\nso I was probably 22, 23 when I did that.\n\nWhere is Hayden Christensen from?\n\nI'm from Canada. I was born in Vancouver, Canada.\n\nAnd then my family moved to Toronto\n\nwhen I was like five years old.\n\nAnd I grew up in the suburbs of Toronto.\n\nAre Hayden Christensen Ewan McGregor friends?\n\nYeah. Yeah, we are friends. I love Ewan.\n\nHe's a great guy, great actor.\n\nAnd it was so nice to get to come back\n\nand do the Obi-Wan show with him.\n\nAnd now we see each other every now and then,\n\nand it's been really nice.\n\nSo yes, we are friends.\n\nCan Hayden Christensen play the piano?\n\nYeah. Yeah, I can play the piano.\n\nI took a lot of piano lessons when I was a kid\n\nand I learned how to play sort of jazz and blues,\n\nwhich was my interest.\n\nI can't read any, you know, sheet music or anything,\n\nbut I can sit down and have some fun at the piano.\n\nThere's a lot of people don't know about me,\n\nsome interesting things to be curious about.\n\nThank you Wired. This was fun.\n\nI hope you learned something.

Martin borrowed liberally\n\nfrom medieval history.\n\nThe Red Wedding itself is based on Scottish history.\n\nIn 1440, the young King of Scotland\n\ninvited the young leaders of the Douglas clan\n\nto dine with him.\n\nWhen you're invited into the feast hall,\n\nyou dine with the king.\n\nThe code of hospitality should maintain\n\nthat no Ill can come to you,\n\nand instead they were betrayed and beheaded.\n\nLike in Game of Thrones,\n\nmuch of the contest over the throne\n\nhas to do with rival factions\n\nthat maybe to some degree or another\n\nare related to one another.\n\nGeorge R.R. Martin took as his template for this\n\nthe late medieval conflict known as the Wars of the Roses.\n\nYou have the Lancaster cousins against the York cousins.\n\nAnd in the show, the Lannisters have a name\n\nthat sounds very much like Lancaster,\n\nand the Starks, with their one syllable name,\n\nthat name chimes nicely with York.\n\nAs far as characters go, the mad Targaryen king\n\nwould seem to be a pretty clear analog\n\nto King Henry VI, who suffered bouts of madness.\n\nCercei Lannister very much resembles Margaret of Anjou,\n\nHenry VI's queen.\n\nHer son was probably not the son of Henry VI.\n\nHenry VI himself commented that he could not remember\n\nwhen the conception had happened\n\nand that it must have been a miracle.\n\nThis, of course, seems to be very much\n\nlike the situation with Cercei,\n\nwhose children are not that of Robert Baratheon,\n\nbut are indeed the children of herself\n\nand her twin brother, Jaime Lannister.\n\n@sulliscomrade asks, do I have narcolepsy\n\nor do I just have the natural sleep cycle\n\nof a medieval peasant?\n\nSleep? in the Middle Ages was very different\n\nfrom sleep today.\n\nPeople in the Middle Ages generally slept biphasically,\n\nwhich means in two stages.\n\nSo there was what was called the first sleep.\n\nIf you're in a natural sleep rhythm\n\nthat does not have any exposure to unnatural light,\n\nyou'll fall asleep when the sun goes down,\n\nyou will sleep for a few hours,\n\nand then you might get up and maybe around 11, midnight,\n\nmight do some chores, might have sex,\n\nyou might visit your neighbors.\n\nIn early castles,\n\nthe lord and lady usually slept in the Great Hall\n\nbehind where they would sit at table for great feasts.\n\nAll of the king's retainers and loyal warriors\n\nwould also sleep in that same room.\n\nThere might be a screen separating their sleeping quarters\n\nfrom the rest of the hall,\n\nbut there was not a ton of privacy.\n\nThen usually around 2:00 a.m. or so,\n\nyou might enter what's called the second sleep,\n\nand this sleep would go until the sun came up\n\nand you would arise\n\nand get ready to do your chores or your work for the day.\n\nIt's not until the advent of electricity\n\nand people are able to work longer hours\n\nand they need to compress their sleep into one single block\n\nthat we see people sleeping, say,\n\nfrom 10:00 pm. to 6:00 a.m.,\n\nand that is not a natural cycle.\n\n@rahsoose asks, honestly,\n\nwhy do medieval people have so many torture devices?\n\nWhat the [beep] was wrong with those people?\n\nFirst of all, they did not have all those torture devices.\n\nYes, they had some,\n\nbut most torture devices you see came into use\n\nor were invented after the Middle Ages\n\nor they're completely fabricated,\n\nespecially by people in the 19th century\n\nwho for some reason wanted to imagine the Middle Ages\n\nas a time of savagery and barbarism\n\nso by contrast they seemed much more civilized.\n\nSo, for example, you might have the Rack.\n\nThat might be legit.\n\nThere is no Iron Maiden.\n\nThere is no Spanish Tickler.\n\nThere were no chastity belts.\n\nAny chastity belt you have seen in a museum is a fake!\n\n@MedievalScholar asks,\n\nwhat is your favorite medieval castle?\n\nThis is a tough question to answer because I have about 20.\n\nThe top of my list is Windsor Castle.\n\nIt is a great example of a motte-and-bailey castle.\n\nBasically, a motte-and-bailey castle has two parts.\n\nFirst, there would be an earthen mound.\n\nOn top of that, you would build a keep.\n\nBelow and in front of the keep would be the bailey section,\n\nand this is where all the activity\n\nof the household would happen.\n\nA motte-and-bailey castle\n\nwould also have another layer outside that enclosure,\n\nwhich would be a moat.\n\nIf you are a knight in armor,\n\nthe last thing you probably want to do\n\nis swim across the moat.\n\nThe moat also prevents the enemy\n\nfrom tunneling under the castle walls to get to the keep.\n\nIf the enemy forces push through the bailey,\n\nthen everyone retreats into the keep.\n\nFor the most part, a castle was defensive.\n\nIt was not luxurious.\n\nThere are, for example, no hallways in castles.\n\nHallways come about with the advent of the palace,\n\nwhich is post-medieval.\n\nAnd because of this there's really no privacy.\n\n@Shark3143 asks,\n\ndid medieval kings ever just piss in the moat or what?\n\nAbsolutely, and it's not just kings!\n\nToilets tended to be a very, very small sort of closet\n\nthat jutted out over the edge of the walls,\n\nsometimes over the moat,\n\nsometimes just down into a courtyard\n\nand some poor guy had to clean it up.\n\nThese were also called garderobes.\n\nGarderobe means in French, a place to keep your robe,\n\nand if you hung your clothes in the garderobe\n\nnext to all the ammonia scent from the urine,\n\nyou were less likely to get mites\n\nand other creepy crawlies in your clothes.\n\n@Wheezy_814 says,\n\ncould y'all imagine the [beep] swampass people had\n\nduring the medieval times?\n\nYes, in the Middle Ages,\n\nyou absolutely were smelling your neighbors\n\nmuch more than you are today,\n\nbut it is a myth that they were completely unsanitary.\n\nPlenty of medieval cities had bathhouses,\n\nwhere a caller would go through the streets\n\nannouncing when the water was hot.\n\nIn certain medieval communities like Strasbourg,\n\nif you were a civil servant,\n\npart of your salary went towards\n\nbeing able to use the bathhouse once a week\n\nso you could get clean.\n\nIt did smell bad, there were open sewers,\n\nbut it was not as bad as some people might believe.\n\n@cavemanpaints asks,\n\nhow did humanity survive the Black Death\n\nwithout vaccines?\n\nThey did not.\n\nMost of them died.\n\nIf we look at the mortality rate for the Black Death,\n\nwe see that it's something like 80%,\n\nand that means if you contracted plague,\n\nyou had maybe an 18-20% chance of surviving.\n\nOtherwise, you were dead.\n\nThe first big wave, which was about 1346 to 1353,\n\nwipes out half of the population, we now estimate.\n\nThe population didn't have any chance to rebound\n\nbecause plague kept coming back\n\nover and over again up, until 1721.\n\nAnd by the way, if you have seen images\n\nthat supposedly represent what plague doctors looked like,\n\nin sort of a primitive hazmat suit,\n\nno one wore those plague masks in the Middle Ages.\n\nYou should know that that is anachronistic.\n\nIt is wrong.\n\nThat probably came into being\n\nsometime around the 17th century.\n\n@i_love_ur_mom3 says, Hansel and Gretel is brutal.\n\nDid parents even love their children?\n\nInfant mortality was so high in the Middle Ages\n\nthat you might think there's no way\n\nmedieval parents could attach any affection\n\nto children who are very likely to die.\n\nEvidence now shows\n\nthat medieval people seem to have loved their children\n\njust as much as modern people do,\n\nthat they mourned when they died,\n\nthat they worried over them when they were sick.\n\nInfant mortality rates before the first year of life\n\nare somewhere around 80%,\n\nbut if you made it past age five,\n\nthere's no reason why you couldn't live into your sixties,\n\neven seventies, and, in some cases, eighties.\n\nThe rate of infant mortality skews lifespan averages\n\nin the Middle Ages\n\nso that it looks like totally healthy people\n\nare walking around and at age 35, they keel over and die.\n\nThat's not the case.\n\nSince you mentioned Hansel and Gretel,\n\nthis story and other stories like Red Riding Hood\n\nhave one purpose,\n\nto teach your children not to go into the woods.\n\nDangers in the woods include, for example, wolves.\n\nThat was a very large danger.\n\nOn the Continent and in England,\n\nyou also have all kinds of outlaws living in the woods.\n\nThey made their living by thievery, looting,\n\nand all kinds of other unsavory practices\n\n@StrongbowBeleg asks, I must ask,\n\ndid medieval artists actually know what animals look like?\n\nThis image is from the Aberdeen Bestiary.\n\nThese are cats.\n\nYes, indeed, they did know what cats looked like.\n\nWe know that they had cats\n\nand that cats were acting then like cats do now\n\nbecause we have evidence of paw prints,\n\nwalking across medieval manuscripts.\n\nWe do have a medieval manuscript\n\nin which a cat apparently peed on the page\n\nand the monk circled it\n\nand noted which cat had done this to the manuscript.\n\nThe way things were drawn or rendered\n\nwas not meant to be a realistic representation.\n\nIt was meant to be symbolic, flat, 2-D,\n\nand often would have lots of signals or clues\n\nthat had hidden meanings,\n\nespecially in manuscript illuminations.\n\nAnd if you're going for a three-dimensional,\n\nrealistic portrayal, that's not quite as easy to do.\n\n@agneponx asks, how [beep] boring would it have been\n\nto be born in medieval times?\n\nWhat the hell did they do for fun?\n\nThey played all kinds of ball games\n\nthat would involve kicking\n\nor hitting something like an inflated pig's bladder\n\nwith a stick.\n\nLawn bowling, where they would roll smooth stones\n\nto knock someone else's ball out of the way.\n\nThey also played board games.\n\nThere's a game called Fox and Geese\n\nthat's sort of a strategy game.\n\nAnd they played chess.\n\nHere we have an example of a chess piece\n\nfrom the famous Isle of Lewis chess set,\n\nwhich was fashioned out of walrus ivory\n\nsometime in the 12th century.\n\n@atothe_d asks, did medieval court jesters actually exist?\n\nSeems fake.\n\nDoes seem fake, but it's not.\n\nCourt jesters absolutely existed.\n\nThey provided some much needed entertainment,\n\nboth for the king and for nobles assembled at court,\n\nespecially on feast days.\n\nOne famous court jester\n\nwho was at the court of King Henry II\n\nwas asked every year during the Christmas holidays\n\nto put on his signature performance,\n\nwhich was a leap, a whistle, and a fart.\n\nBut jesters, or fools as they were sometimes called,\n\nmight be there just for entertainment, juggling, antics.\n\nOthers might be the individual who was the only individual\n\nwho could speak truth to the king\n\nwithout fear of getting beheaded.\n\nBecause this position of fool or jester was meant\n\non one level not to be taken seriously,\n\nthese individuals could get away\n\nwith giving the king advice or information\n\nor saying things that other people at court just could not.\n\n@kenziexlittle asks,\n\nhow the [beep] did jousting become a thing?\n\nJousting started out as a very necessary, pragmatic activity\n\nthat was to train young knights for warfare.\n\nOver time, however, jousting became something of a spectacle\n\nand this eventually developed\n\ninto the full-fledged tournament,\n\none of which we see in the beginning\n\nof House of the Dragon.\n\nThe basics are there,\n\ntwo knights riding at each other on horseback\n\nwith a very small barrier in between\n\nto keep them to either side of what are known as the lists.\n\nHouse of the Dragon has some of the lower classes there.\n\nThis wouldn't have been the case in the Middle Ages.\n\nThis was really something that the upper classes attended\n\nand the lower classes might be present\n\nas food vendors or sellers of other goods\n\noutside the tournament arena, but not inside.\n\nBoydell & Brewer asks,\n\ndid you know that in Medieval England,\n\nanimals could be tried and convicted of crimes?\n\nThere are records of animals being taken to court.\n\nAnd yes, indeed, there are.\n\nIf an animal had caused damage to crops\n\nor to other livestock or had injured a person,\n\nvery often the animal could be put on trial.\n\nAnd in this case,\n\nthey were often thought to be possessed by Satan\n\nwhen they did these terrible things.\n\nEven more interesting than animals on trial, though,\n\nis the case of animals who became saints.\n\nIn 13th century France,\n\nthere is the story of the Sainted Greyhound,\n\nand this is a story in which the lord of a castle\n\nleaves his young son in a cradle while he goes out hunting\n\nand when he comes back,\n\nhe finds the son's room is a disaster.\n\nThere's blood everywhere.\n\nThe cradle's been overturned.\n\nThe dog has blood on its muzzle,\n\nand so the Lord thinks that the dog has killed his son,\n\nso he kills the greyhound, flips over the cradle,\n\nand finds that, in fact, what the dog had done\n\nwas protect the child from a snake.\n\nAnd the lord feels so bad\n\nthat he creates a shrine to this greyhound,\n\nand her name is Saint Guinefort, and pretty soon,\n\nshe becomes a local patron saint to children.\n\nAnd a little bit later the Catholic church said,\n\nno, you are not allowed to have animal saints.\n\nWhat is wrong with you people?!\n\n@NeffliesStuff asks, Was there a real King Arthur?\n\nMaybe?\n\nIn about 1191, the monks at Glastonbury Abbey claim\n\nthat they have found the grave of King Arthur.\n\nAnd the monks report that in the coffin they discovered,\n\nthere was a very large man\n\nwho had died from an ax blow to the head\n\nand they know it's Arthur's grave\n\nbecause on it is this leaden cross,\n\nand engraved on the cross in sort of very early script,\n\nhere lies buried the renowned King Arthur\n\nin the Isle of Avalon.\n\nNow, in the 20th century,\n\narcheologists excavated where the monks said they had dug\n\nand they found out that, indeed, they had excavated someone.\n\nWhether or not it was actually King Arthur, we don't know.\n\nThe cross itself has been lost.\n\nOne clue that works in favor of this\n\nis the spelling of Arthur's name, Artorius,\n\nwhich is a really early spelling.\n\nIf you were gonna dummy up a cross\n\nto say you found the grave of Arthur in the 12th century,\n\nyou'd probably spell it Artus.\n\nAlso, the shape of the letters\n\nseem to be earlier than 12th century,\n\nalthough, again, that could be part of the forgery.\n\n@XavierTorch asks, did medieval knights name their swords?\n\nBecause that's big in fiction.\n\nIn the medieval tradition,\n\nthe most famous sword is Excalibur,\n\nwhich belongs to King Arthur.\n\nOther medieval individuals who had actual named swords\n\ninclude Charlemagne, who had Joyeuse,\n\nhis nephew, Roland, Durandal.\n\nSome of these would be passed from generation to generation,\n\nand that's one reason why they would have names.\n\nPhysical objects such as the sword\n\nwould help to identify that person\n\nas the new head of the household.\n\n@IreneC_Bgv says, why did the Vikings attack?\n\nWhy these farmers and fishermen suddenly decided\n\nto go looting and pillaging has to do with the possibility\n\nthat maybe the farmland they were working\n\nwas no longer quite as fertile,\n\nand perhaps population had increased to the point\n\nthat you had what's called this youth bulge,\n\nwhere there's too many young men\n\nand not enough for them to do.\n\nWhatever the reason, at the end of the eighth century,\n\nthe Vikings start to move out\n\nfrom what we think of as their home territory\n\nhere in Scandinavia.\n\nAll of these blue pins on the map indicate places\n\nwhere they either set up settlements\n\nor they raided frequently.\n\nThey made most of their money\n\nlooting Christian churches and monasteries.\n\nThe Vikings were not Christian,\n\nso they didn't know what these big structures were,\n\nfull of men who couldn't or wouldn't fight,\n\nexcept for they seemed to be full\n\nof lots of nice, shiny things.\n\nThey sailed up the Seine and attacked Paris.\n\nMade it all the way to the Middle East.\n\nAnd if we go back to France, this area is Normandy.\n\nWhy is it called Normandy?\n\nBecause that is where the north men settled.\n\nThere was almost nowhere that the Vikings did not go\n\nin the Middle Ages.\n\nOh, here's a good one.\n\nWho is your favorite influential woman in history?\n\nI have several favorite medieval women.\n\nRight at the top though has got to be Eleanor of Aquitaine,\n\nwho famously was married\n\nto both the French king and the English king\n\nand was mother to two more kings.\n\nEleanor was the heiress of the huge Duchy of Aquitaine,\n\nwhich is in what today is southern France.\n\nShe was married off to the French king.\n\nOvernight, that almost doubled the size of France.\n\nBut the French king wasn't a great king.\n\nHe would've made a great priest.\n\nEleanor, coming from the south,\n\nwhich was the land of troubadours\n\nand chivalry and courtly love\n\nand where women had much more power and influence,\n\nreally was not having a great time up north in Paris,\n\nwhere people were much more serious.\n\nShe and the French king had two children,\n\nbut after a certain point,\n\nit was clear that this was not working\n\nand they got the Pope to annul their marriage.\n\nOnce she was free,\n\nEleanor wrote to the young Prince Henry,\n\nletting him know that she was available\n\nshould he be interested, and he was.\n\nShe marries Henry\n\nand had an additional eight to ten pregnancies.\n\nShe is the mother of the famous Richard the Lionheart\n\nand the infamous King John.\n\nShe was busy up until the very end of her life.\n\nShe died when she was about 80 years old.\n\n@coveredinliz asks, what did the Holy Grail even do?\n\nJust a pretty cup?\n\nIt is such an important religious object.\n\nEither the cup that Christ drank from at the Last Supper\n\nand/or the cup that Joseph of Arimathea used\n\nto catch Christ's blood when he was on the cross.\n\nWhat's fascinating about the grail legend\n\nin the Arthurian stories\n\nis that no one ever really succeeds.\n\nIn fact, the only knight\n\nwho really has a true measure of success is Sir Galahad.\n\nHe gets to see the grail and when he does see it,\n\nwe are told in Sir Thomas Malory's Morte d'Arthur\n\nthat Galahad had sees something\n\nand we don't get to know what it is.\n\nHis flesh begins to tremble\n\nwhen he beholds these spiritual things\n\nand then he dies and gets taken up to heaven,\n\nwith the grail!\n\nFor everyone else,\n\nthe quest is pretty much a dismal failure.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nThanks very much for watching Medieval Support.\n\n[no audio]", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image":

closet\n\nthat jutted out over the edge of the walls,\n\nsometimes over the moat,\n\nsometimes just down into a courtyard\n\nand some poor guy had to clean it up.\n\nThese were also called garderobes.\n\nGarderobe means in French, a place to keep your robe,\n\nand if you hung your clothes in the garderobe\n\nnext to all the ammonia scent from the urine,\n\nyou were less likely to get mites\n\nand other creepy crawlies in your clothes.\n\n@Wheezy_814 says,\n\ncould y'all imagine the [beep] swampass people had\n\nduring the medieval times?\n\nYes, in the Middle Ages,\n\nyou absolutely were smelling your neighbors\n\nmuch more than you are today,\n\nbut it is a myth that they were completely unsanitary.\n\nPlenty of medieval cities had bathhouses,\n\nwhere a caller would go through the streets\n\nannouncing when the water was hot.\n\nIn certain medieval communities like Strasbourg,\n\nif you were a civil servant,\n\npart of your salary went towards\n\nbeing able to use the bathhouse once a week\n\nso you could get clean.\n\nIt did smell bad, there were open sewers,\n\nbut it was not as bad as some people might believe.\n\n@cavemanpaints asks,\n\nhow did humanity survive the Black Death\n\nwithout vaccines?\n\nThey did not.\n\nMost of them died.\n\nIf we look at the mortality rate for the Black Death,\n\nwe see that it's something like 80%,\n\nand that means if you contracted plague,\n\nyou had maybe an 18-20% chance of surviving.\n\nOtherwise, you were dead.\n\nThe first big wave, which was about 1346 to 1353,\n\nwipes out half of the population, we now estimate.\n\nThe population didn't have any chance to rebound\n\nbecause plague kept coming back\n\nover and over again up, until 1721.\n\nAnd by the way, if you have seen images\n\nthat supposedly represent what plague doctors looked like,\n\nin sort of a primitive hazmat suit,\n\nno one wore those plague masks in the Middle Ages.\n\nYou should know that that is anachronistic.\n\nIt is wrong.\n\nThat probably came into being\n\nsometime around the 17th century.\n\n@i_love_ur_mom3 says, Hansel and Gretel is brutal.\n\nDid parents even love their children?\n\nInfant mortality was so high in the Middle Ages\n\nthat you might think there's no way\n\nmedieval parents could attach any affection\n\nto children who are very likely to die.\n\nEvidence now shows\n\nthat medieval people seem to have loved their children\n\njust as much as modern people do,\n\nthat they mourned when they died,\n\nthat they worried over them when they were sick.\n\nInfant mortality rates before the first year of life\n\nare somewhere around 80%,\n\nbut if you made it past age five,\n\nthere's no reason why you couldn't live into your sixties,\n\neven seventies, and, in some cases, eighties.\n\nThe rate of infant mortality skews lifespan averages\n\nin the Middle Ages\n\nso that it looks like totally healthy people\n\nare walking around and at age 35, they keel over and die.\n\nThat's not the case.\n\nSince you mentioned Hansel and Gretel,\n\nthis story and other stories like Red Riding Hood\n\nhave one purpose,\n\nto teach your children not to go into the woods.\n\nDangers in the woods include, for example, wolves.\n\nThat was a very large danger.\n\nOn the Continent and in England,\n\nyou also have all kinds of outlaws living in the woods.\n\nThey made their living by thievery, looting,\n\nand all kinds of other unsavory practices\n\n@StrongbowBeleg asks, I must ask,\n\ndid medieval artists actually know what animals look like?\n\nThis image is from the Aberdeen Bestiary.\n\nThese are cats.\n\nYes, indeed, they did know what cats looked like.\n\nWe know that they had cats\n\nand that cats were acting then like cats do now\n\nbecause we have evidence of paw prints,\n\nwalking across medieval manuscripts.\n\nWe do have a medieval manuscript\n\nin which a cat apparently peed on the page\n\nand the monk circled it\n\nand noted which cat had done this to the manuscript.\n\nThe way things were drawn or rendered\n\nwas not meant to be a realistic representation.\n\nIt was meant to be symbolic, flat, 2-D,\n\nand often would have lots of signals or clues\n\nthat had hidden meanings,\n\nespecially in manuscript illuminations.\n\nAnd if you're going for a three-dimensional,\n\nrealistic portrayal, that's not quite as easy to do.\n\n@agneponx asks, how [beep] boring would it have been\n\nto be born in medieval times?\n\nWhat the hell did they do for fun?\n\nThey played all kinds of ball games\n\nthat would involve kicking\n\nor hitting something like an inflated pig's bladder\n\nwith a stick.\n\nLawn bowling, where they would roll smooth stones\n\nto knock someone else's ball out of the way.\n\nThey also played board games.\n\nThere's a game called Fox and Geese\n\nthat's sort of a strategy game.\n\nAnd they played chess.\n\nHere we have an example of a chess piece\n\nfrom the famous Isle of Lewis chess set,\n\nwhich was fashioned out of walrus ivory\n\nsometime in the 12th century.\n\n@atothe_d asks, did medieval court jesters actually exist?\n\nSeems fake.\n\nDoes seem fake, but it's not.\n\nCourt jesters absolutely existed.\n\nThey provided some much needed entertainment,\n\nboth for the king and for nobles assembled at court,\n\nespecially on feast days.\n\nOne famous court jester\n\nwho was at the court of King Henry II\n\nwas asked every year during the Christmas holidays\n\nto put on his signature performance,\n\nwhich was a leap, a whistle, and a fart.\n\nBut jesters, or fools as they were sometimes called,\n\nmight be there just for entertainment, juggling, antics.\n\nOthers might be the individual who was the only individual\n\nwho could speak truth to the king\n\nwithout fear of getting beheaded.\n\nBecause this position of fool or jester was meant\n\non one level not to be taken seriously,\n\nthese individuals could get away\n\nwith giving the king advice or information\n\nor saying things that other people at court just could not.\n\n@kenziexlittle asks,\n\nhow the [beep] did jousting become a thing?\n\nJousting started out as a very necessary, pragmatic activity\n\nthat was to train young knights for warfare.\n\nOver time, however, jousting became something of a spectacle\n\nand this eventually developed\n\ninto the full-fledged tournament,\n\none of which we see in the beginning\n\nof House of the Dragon.\n\nThe basics are there,\n\ntwo knights riding at each other on horseback\n\nwith a very small barrier in between\n\nto keep them to either side of what are known as the lists.\n\nHouse of the Dragon has some of the lower classes there.\n\nThis wouldn't have been the case in the Middle Ages.\n\nThis was really something that the upper classes attended\n\nand the lower classes might be present\n\nas food vendors or sellers of other goods\n\noutside the tournament arena, but not inside.\n\nBoydell & Brewer asks,\n\ndid you know that in Medieval England,\n\nanimals could be tried and convicted of crimes?\n\nThere are records of animals being taken to court.\n\nAnd yes, indeed, there are.\n\nIf an animal had caused damage to crops\n\nor to other livestock or had injured a person,\n\nvery often the animal could be put on trial.\n\nAnd in this case,\n\nthey were often thought to be possessed by Satan\n\nwhen they did these terrible things.\n\nEven more interesting than animals on trial, though,\n\nis the case of animals who became saints.\n\nIn 13th century France,\n\nthere is the story of the Sainted Greyhound,\n\nand this is a story in which the lord of a castle\n\nleaves his young son in a cradle while he goes out hunting\n\nand when he comes back,\n\nhe finds the son's room is a disaster.\n\nThere's blood everywhere.\n\nThe cradle's been overturned.\n\nThe dog has blood on its muzzle,\n\nand so the Lord thinks that the dog has killed his son,\n\nso he kills the greyhound, flips over the cradle,\n\nand finds that, in fact, what the dog had done\n\nwas protect the child from a snake.\n\nAnd the lord feels so bad\n\nthat he creates a shrine to this greyhound,\n\nand her name is Saint Guinefort, and pretty soon,\n\nshe becomes a local patron saint to children.\n\nAnd a little bit later the Catholic church said,\n\nno, you are not allowed to have animal saints.\n\nWhat is wrong with you people?!\n\n@NeffliesStuff asks, Was there a real King Arthur?\n\nMaybe?\n\nIn about 1191, the monks at Glastonbury Abbey claim\n\nthat they have found the grave of King Arthur.\n\nAnd the monks report that in the coffin they discovered,\n\nthere was a very large man\n\nwho had died from an ax blow to the head\n\nand they know it's Arthur's grave\n\nbecause on it is this leaden cross,\n\nand engraved on the cross in sort of very early script,\n\nhere lies buried the renowned King Arthur\n\nin the Isle of Avalon.\n\nNow, in the 20th century,\n\narcheologists excavated where the monks said they had dug\n\nand they found out that, indeed, they had excavated someone.\n\nWhether or not it was actually King Arthur, we don't know.\n\nThe cross itself has been lost.\n\nOne clue that works in favor of this\n\nis the spelling of Arthur's name, Artorius,\n\nwhich is a really early spelling.\n\nIf you were gonna dummy up a cross\n\nto say you found the grave of Arthur in the 12th century,\n\nyou'd probably spell it Artus.\n\nAlso, the shape of the letters\n\nseem to be earlier than 12th century,\n\nalthough, again, that could be part of the forgery.\n\n@XavierTorch asks, did medieval knights name their swords?\n\nBecause that's big in fiction.\n\nIn the medieval tradition,\n\nthe most famous sword is Excalibur,\n\nwhich belongs to King Arthur.\n\nOther medieval individuals who had actual named swords\n\ninclude Charlemagne, who had Joyeuse,\n\nhis nephew, Roland, Durandal.\n\nSome of these would be passed from generation to generation,\n\nand that's one reason why they would have names.\n\nPhysical objects such as the sword\n\nwould help to identify that person\n\nas the new head of the household.\n\n@IreneC_Bgv says, why did the Vikings attack?\n\nWhy these farmers and fishermen suddenly decided\n\nto go looting and pillaging has to do with the possibility\n\nthat maybe the farmland they were working\n\nwas no longer quite as fertile,\n\nand perhaps population had increased to the point\n\nthat you had what's called this youth bulge,\n\nwhere there's too many young men\n\nand not enough for them to do.\n\nWhatever the reason, at the end of the eighth century,\n\nthe Vikings start to move out\n\nfrom what we think of as their home territory\n\nhere in Scandinavia.\n\nAll of these blue pins on the map indicate places\n\nwhere they either set up settlements\n\nor they raided frequently.\n\nThey made most of their money\n\nlooting Christian churches and monasteries.\n\nThe Vikings were not Christian,\n\nso they didn't know what these big structures were,\n\nfull of men who couldn't or wouldn't fight,\n\nexcept for they seemed to be full\n\nof lots of nice, shiny things.\n\nThey sailed up the Seine and attacked Paris.\n\nMade it all the way to the Middle East.\n\nAnd if we go back to France, this area is Normandy.\n\nWhy is it called Normandy?\n\nBecause that is where the north men settled.\n\nThere was almost nowhere that the Vikings did not go\n\nin the Middle Ages.\n\nOh, here's a good one.\n\nWho is your favorite influential woman in history?\n\nI have several favorite medieval women.\n\nRight at the top though has got to be Eleanor of Aquitaine,\n\nwho famously was married\n\nto both the French king and the English king\n\nand was mother to two more kings.\n\nEleanor was the heiress of the huge Duchy of Aquitaine,\n\nwhich is in what today is southern France.\n\nShe was married off to the French king.\n\nOvernight, that almost doubled the size of France.\n\nBut the French king wasn't a great king.\n\nHe would've made a great priest.\n\nEleanor, coming from the south,\n\nwhich was the land of troubadours\n\nand chivalry and courtly love\n\nand where women had much more power and influence,\n\nreally was not having a great time up north in Paris,\n\nwhere people were much more serious.\n\nShe and the French king had two children,\n\nbut after a certain point,\n\nit was clear that this was not working\n\nand they got the Pope to annul their marriage.\n\nOnce she was free,\n\nEleanor wrote to the young Prince Henry,\n\nletting him know that she was available\n\nshould he be interested, and he was.\n\nShe marries Henry\n\nand had an additional eight to ten pregnancies.\n\nShe is the mother of the famous Richard the Lionheart\n\nand the infamous King John.\n\nShe was busy up until the very end of her life.\n\nShe died when she was about 80 years old.\n\n@coveredinliz asks, what did the Holy Grail even do?\n\nJust a pretty cup?\n\nIt is such an important religious object.\n\nEither the cup that Christ drank from at the Last Supper\n\nand/or the cup that Joseph of Arimathea used\n\nto catch Christ's blood when he was on the cross.\n\nWhat's fascinating about the grail legend\n\nin the Arthurian stories\n\nis that no one ever really succeeds.\n\nIn fact, the only knight\n\nwho really has a true measure of success is Sir Galahad.\n\nHe gets to see the grail and when he does see it,\n\nwe are told in Sir Thomas Malory's Morte d'Arthur\n\nthat Galahad had sees something\n\nand we don't get to know what it is.\n\nHis flesh begins to tremble\n\nwhen he beholds these spiritual things\n\nand then he dies and gets taken up to heaven,\n\nwith the grail!\n\nFor everyone else,\n\nthe quest is pretty much a dismal failure.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nThanks very much for watching Medieval Support.\n\n[no audio]", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image":

[Erin laughs]\n\nDid Starlight join The Boys?\n\nYes. [bell dings]\n\nOoh, ooh! Yes!\n\nI was like-\n\nShe's a part of The Boys now!\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nIs Homeland pure evil?\n\nWhoa! Whoa. Wait.\n\nHe's a flawed human being like all of us.\n\nI do think that like, he is pretty freaking evil,\n\nbut I think it's 'cause he's got some PTSD.\n\n[bell dings] I mean,\n\nhe was raised in a lab and he was abused.\n\nWhat happened on the plane with Maeve and Homelander?\n\nOh. Oh God.\n\n[Claudia groans] Okay.\n\nThe deaths of so many people.\n\nSo many people. Homelander just...\n\n[bell dings] See-\n\nThat was a- He is evil.\n\nHe is evil. Mass murder.\n\nA little mass murder.\n\nPreventable mass murder.\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Preventable.\n\nThat stuck with me.\n\nThat one, it was a scary moment.\n\nOof. Yeah. Shocking.\n\nWho can beat Homelander?\n\nI mean- Any of us.\n\nI think Neuman.\n\n[buzzer dings]\n\nI dunno.\n\nI feel like he cheats\n\n'cause he has so many powers.\n\nSo like, we need...\n\nYeah, it's not really fair.\n\nWe need to talk to the writers about this.\n\nHe has like, six different powers\n\nand we only have one or two, so.\n\nBut like, I feel like between the three of us...\n\n[Erin clicks her tongue]\n\nWe- Yeah.\n\nGo for it.

Because- I don't know.\n\nHe didn't like his name, John,\n\nthat he was given at birth.\n\nOh! [buzzer dings]\n\nAnd he thought, I'm gonna be the Home...\n\nHe's choosing his like, stage name, essentially.\n\nYeah. That reminds me, by the way-\n\nAnytime someone asks me if Antony Starr,\n\nwho plays Homelander,\n\nif that's his stage name,\n\nI say yes.\n\n[all three laugh]\n\nHomelander would be such a good name\n\nfor like, a car.\n\nGood marketing, Karen. Yeah.\n\nWas Starlight a pageant kid?\n\nI read that as pregnant.\n\n[all three laugh]\n\nI mean...\n\nWas Starlight pregnant as a child?\n\nAs a kid? Sorry, no. Yes.\n\n[bell dings]\n\nI was a beauty pageant child. Yeah.\n\nYes. Yeah.\n\nCrazy mom, Donna January.\n\nCould Neuman kill Homelander?\n\nHell yeah.\n\nYes! Yes! Girls get it done!\n\nYes!

Yeah, we're biased.\n\nBut, also girls get it done.\n\nWe're all waiting for that.\n\nHow did Starlight get into the Seven?\n\nI'm gonna let you in- By auditioning.\n\nHard work. [bell dings]\n\nHard work. You know, talent.\n\nShe has- Perseverance.\n\nMy audition character for The Boys, the show,\n\nwas Starlight's audition to get into the Seven.\n\nWhich is super meta.\n\nYeah, that's so meta.

[bell dings]\n\nThey did! Yeah, we did.\n\nThank you, A-train.\n\nI'm kidding.\n\n[all three laugh]\n\nHow does Kimiko get her powers back?\n\nSelf love. [buzzer dings]\n\n[all three laughing] Self love.\n\nInject her.\n\nIs Victoria Neuman evil?\n\nNo. No!\n\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\nShe's gray. A gray area. She has her reasons.\n\nYes. This is fun.\n\nWhy is Ashley going bald?\n\nStress.\n\nEveryone has their own way of coping with stress.\n\nNo one is doing it to her. She's-\n\nShe's doing it to her.\n\nShe's like, she needs to- She's self-soothing.\n\nShe's self-soothing. Yeah.\n\nBy ripping her hair out of her scalp.\n\n[bell dings]\n\nI do love her bald wig. We all do it.\n\nThat she has to put on. It's such a good wig.\n\nSmeagol. Smeagol, yeah! [laugh]\n\nIn a beautiful, sexy way.\n\n[Erin] In a beautiful, yeah, exactly.\n\nColby kills it in that wig.\n\nOh my God. In every scene.\n\nWill the Boys get new powers in season four?\n\nI can't tell you that.\n\nCan't you? Can we?\n\nNo, we can- Next.\n\nNo, no, no, no.\n\nI dunno if we can talk about it.\n\nMove on. I don't wanna get shot.\n\nJust wind down. [laughing]\n\nWhat unique physical ability does Kimiko possess?\n\nYou can, I mean, like, you're obviously really strong\n\nand you dance pretty well.\n\nManiac. I think about that.\n\nYeah. But you heal.\n\n[bell dings]\n\nI do. You heal.\n\nIt's my favorite power. She heals.\n\nAre the Boys good guys?\n\nYou know, it's a gray world.\n\nI think they have good intentions.\n\n[bell dings]\n\nYeah, yeah. Everyone does.\n\nFor the most part.\n\nI feel like our show\n\ndoes a really good job of showing good and bad.\n\nWe possess bad qualities, also good qualities.\n\nRedemptive.\n\nIt's a politically correct answer we're giving.\n\nDid Billy Butcher take Compound V?\n\nYes! Yes.\n\nWait, Temp V. [bell dings]\n\n[All Three] Temp V.\n\nCompound V.\n\nGreat Google question. Temp V.\n\nYeah. He gave in.\n\nYeah, he did. We all do it sometimes.\n\nHe's a hypocrite.\n\nYoink!\n\nHe's a hypocrite.\n\nHow powerful is Starlight?\n\nSo powerful. I can answer that.\n\n[bell dings]\n\nThe bitch can fly.\n\n[Erin and Claudia laugh]\n\nThe bitch can fight. The bitch can fight,\n\nthe bitch can fly.\n\nThe bitch can do all.\n\nCan do it all. Excuse me.\n\nI can blast lightning bolts.\n\nGirls get it done! [Claudia and Karen laugh]\n\nDon't forget about my lightning bolts, please.\n\nThe bitch has lightning bolts!\n\nPew pew!\n\nDoes Hughie tell Starlight the truth?\n\nWell... Like, yes and no.\n\nYes. Yeah. Ultimately, yeah.\n\nYeah. I think so.\n\n[bell dings]\n\nHe tries to do it the first few seasons.\n\nHe's head over heels for you.\n\nYeah, he won't lie to you. He's honest.\n\nListen, I ship us. So eventually-\n\nHe's like a golden retriever boyfriend.\n\nHe is! Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nThe truth comes out with that dude.\n\nHas to. What a sweetie.\n\nSweetie. We love him, we love him.\n\nWe love him. We love Hughie.\n\nDoes Hughie get powers? Yes, he does.\n\nHe does! [bell dings]\n\nHe shoots up that Temp V.\n\nThat's me disappearing. And lies to me.\n\nAnd naked. But don't- And naked.\n\nWhy can't Kimiko speak?\n\nWe cannot answer that question because it is in season four.\n\nOh.\n\nWe can't answer that. We can't.\n\nWe can't tell you that. Nope. No.\n\nWatch the show.\n\nWho does Victoria Neuman secretly work for?\n\n[sighs dramatically]\n\nThat's a secret. Yeah. [chuckles]\n\nI'll never tell. [laughs]\n\nI don't know any of the answers to the Victoria questions.\n\nWell, Victoria in the comic books is Vic the Veep\n\nand he's a dimwitted man.\n\nBut in our show, Stan Edgar.\n\nThey might be asking, like, yeah, yeah.\n\nI'm gonna say Stan.\n\nI'm gonna say father figure Stan.\n\n[bell dings] Giancarlo.\n\nEsposito. Esposito!\n\nLove him.\n\nHow does Kimiko first come into contact with the Boys?\n\nThere's a woman in a cage and then they find her.\n\nShe escapes and then gouges someone's eyes out and...\n\n[bell dings]\n\nIt's like every rom-com that I've seen.\n\nBut how do they- Honestly,\n\nit should be a rom-com.\n\nI'd watch it. It is a rom-com.\n\nWe do watch it. It's the show.\n\nThe Boys is a rom-com. It's a rom-com.\n\nWhat unique powers does Queen Maeve have?\n\nLeaving the scene of a crime early.\n\n[buzzer dings] Early bird.\n\nGetting out.\n\nWhat are Kimiko's powers?\n\nThe healing and the strength.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo powerful. She's so strong.\n\n[bell dings]\n\nShe's so strong. You are.\n\nImmortality is awesome. It's pretty dope.\n\nI would love to fly, just, like on wires.\n\nOh, my god. It looks fun.\n\nIt's so much fun.\n\nI mean, like, whew. I went high up in the air last year.\n\nI feel like I'd get vertigo.\n\nYeah. It's not really a spoiler.\n\nYou've seen me. Yeah.\n\nYou've seen me with vertigo. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nHow did Starlight trick Homelander?\n\nMm. Hid my phone! [bell dings]\n\nI think- Yeah, that's right.\n\nJust recorded him. Wow, yeah.\n\nTechnology. Still didn't work.\n\nHome Teamers are still at it,\n\nbut you know. What are gonna do?\n\nWhy does Queen Maeve fake her own death?\n\nBecause she's smart and she wants to get out.\n\nI mean, she's so smart.\n\nShe wants out. She's like, I'm done.\n\nIf you're dealing with these people,\n\n[bell dings]\n\nI'd fake my death and go live in The Bahamas or something.\n\nI dunno. Yeah, yeah.\n\nPut me on an island somewhere.\n\nI'm out.\n\nShe's like the person in the scary movie\n\nthat we're all like,\n\nThe sound! Do you hear that sound over there?\n\nAnd she's like, I'm outta this.\n\nThat's so true! That's it.\n\nThat's so true.\n\nShe's like, There's no reception over here.\n\nI'm gonna go this way.\n\nYeah. She's the only survivor.\n\nShe's like, Get outta the house.\n\nShe gets out.\n\nShe gets out. Yeah.\n\nGood for her.\n\nOkay.\n\nWhy did Victoria Neuman do that to everybody\n\nduring the hearing?\n\nI was having a bad day.\n\nYou were going through something.\n\nSecrets. Secrets.\n\nSecrets. Secrets.\n\nShe was frustrated.\n\nShe was really going through it.\n\nShe was having a bad day.\n\nShe felt like it.\n\nI didn't have coffee that day. You know?\n\nShe was hangry. It was pretty intense.\n\nShe was like, Pop some heads. It's fine.\n\nI think that's a really good answer.\n\n[buzzer dings] I don't want the real answer.\n\nThe real answer is bleak. That is the real answer.\n\nThe real answer is bleak. Yeah, it's intense.\n\nHow does Queen Maeve try to empower Starlight\n\nagainst Vought's manipulative tactics?\n\nShe says, like, Look at me. Look at where I'm at.\n\nLook at the power that you have\n\nand don't let yourself sink down\n\ninto this hole like I have. [bell dings]\n\nI would say you, Starlight,\n\nalso had an impact on her, though,\n\nbecause you inspire her to do the right thing in the end.\n\nYeah. You know?\n\nI think when you've got like, hope,\n\nin a place that's like literally just-\n\nHopeless? A drought,\n\nthat in itself can be contagious.\n\nWhich member of the Seven does Starlight replace\n\nwhen she joins the team?\n\nLamplighter.

{"title": "Walton Goggins Answers The Web's Most Searched Questions", "text": "Transcript\n\nSo sorry.\n\nIs this seat taken?\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nTable for one, right?\n\nHello, I'm Walton Goggins\n\nand this is the Wired Auto Complete Interview.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nOkay.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nWhere did Walton Goggins grow up?\n\nI grew up in a little bitty town called Lithia Springs,\n\nwhich is about 20 minutes outside of Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nIt's a beautiful little town.\n\nIt only had one stop sign\n\nand nobody else is from there but me.\n\nDoes Walton Goggins really have a southern accent?\n\nI do have a Southern accent, you know,\n\nbecause I'm from the south,\n\nso I speak like the other people speak that I grew up with.\n\nI can change it.\n\nI can't really do many accents.\n\nI mean, I can do Southern accent\n\nand I can just do one\n\nthat has just a slight southern accent to it.\n\nThat's about it.\n\nIt's the only range I have.\n\nWalton Goggins looks like Jim Morrison.\n\nThank you.\n\nReally?\n\nJim Morrison if he had teeth this big, I'll take it.\n\nLast one.\n\nWalton Goggins photography.\n\nOh, I like taking photos.\n\nI like traveling and I like taking pictures of the people\n\nthat I meet along the way.\n\nSo photography for me is a really big deal.\n\nIt's the way I document my experiences.\n\nCheck this out.\n\nNext.\n\nThis guy, is he in the union?\n\nWhat is Walton Goggins best known for?\n\nWell, depends on who you ask, right?\n\nI like to think clogging, but most people would disagree.\n\nMaybe The Hateful Eight.\n\nMaybe The Shield, may be Justified,\n\nmaybe Vice Principals,\n\nmaybe The Righteous Gemstones.\n\nBut right now, it's for Fallout.\n\nOkay.\n\nWalton Goggins upcoming projects.\n\nFallout season two.\n\nOh, and I am currently doing the White Lotus season three.\n\nHow about that?\n\nUnbelievable.\n\nWe're filming it down in Thailand.\n\nWalton Goggins, Quentin Tarantino.\n\nOh, how about that?\n\nWhen I was a little kid, I never thought I would see this\n\nname next to this name.\n\nI worked with Quentin two times on Django Unchained\n\nand The Hateful Eight.\n\nAnd he is my favorite filmmaker.\n\nLiving or deceased.\n\nThank God he's still living, my favorite.\n\nOkay, Walton Goggins western movies.\n\nI've been in a few of those.\n\nI love western movies.\n\nI love watching western movies.\n\nMy son was 11 years old when we really started\n\nintroducing him to a lot of different films.\n\nAnd the western genre was the first one\n\nthat we started with.\n\nLike The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,\n\nRio Bravo, Stagecoach, and all the rest of them.\n\nAnd he loves the westerns as much as I do.\n\nSergio Leone, I love you.\n\nOh, one fan fact.\n\nEnnio Morricone,\n\nyou know the great guy who won the Academy Award,\n\nwho did all of Leone's films?\n\nI got to record with him at Abbey Road in London.\n\nHow about that?\n\nCan Walton Goggins sing?\n\nYou know, the greatest compliment I've ever been given,\n\ntrue story, was Walton Goggins can sing\n\nwell enough to believe that he would never\n\nmake it as a singer.\n\nTrue story.\n\nCan Walton Goggins clog?\n\nYeah.\n\nIf this was a full shot, I would clog for you here,\n\nbut it's not.\n\nSo I can't.\n\nJust trust that these feet were made for clogging.\n\n'Cause my mother was a clogger\n\nand she got me into a clogging class.\n\nBelieve it or not.\n\nThat was a thing in Lithia Springs, Georgia, where I'm from.\n\nAnd she did it because my mom loves to dance\n\nand she wanted me to dance with her.\n\nSo I learned how to clog, but I also learned how to bop\n\nand bopping is the Florida version\n\nof the North Carolina shag.\n\nIt's super cool.\n\nYou know what else my mom taught me\n\nthat's not on this list?\n\nShe taught me how to two step\n\nand I'm a mean two stepper.\n\nWalton Goggins Misbehavin.\n\nYes, this is a song that I sang with Jennifer Nettles\n\nin season one of The Righteous Gemstones.\n\nThe thing that I had going for me was singing it\n\nwith Jennifer Nettles.\n\nThey boosted all of the lines that she sang\n\nand they brought all the lines that I sang down.\n\nYou know what?\n\nMaybe you know this lyric?\n\nRunning through the house with a pickle in my mouth.\n\nThank you.\n\nWow.\n\nGod, you should do this for a living.\n\nIt's extraordinary.\n\nIs Walton Goggins a bad guy in Fallout?\n\nOh, a great, great question.\n\nThe thing that I love about doing Fallout so much,\n\nit was architected in a way that the antagonist\n\nbecomes the protagonist\n\nthat may also become the antagonist again.\n\nAnd I would say that that applies\n\nto everybody that's in the show.\n\nIt takes a lot of energy to survive in the wasteland.\n\nAnd sometimes you gotta be a good guy\n\nand sometimes you gotta be a bad guy.\n\nIs Walton Goggins a nice guy?\n\n[beep], yes, I am.\n\nI'm the nicest guy.\n\nWhere's the next [beep] card, man?\n\nJust kidding.\n\nCan I cuss?\n\nI don't even know if I can cuss.\n\nOkay, is Walton Goggins...\n\nWow, this is a long piece of tape.\n\nThis is scaring me.\n\nComing back to Justified.\n\nI would absolutely love to come back to Justified.\n\nSo would Tim Olyphant,\n\nand I know FX would like to have Justified\n\nback on the air.\n\nIt's just a matter of timing.\n\nNext card.\n\n[beep], man.\n\nThank God you're not in the union.\n\nWhen does Walton Goggins\n\nappear in Righteous Gemstones?\n\nOh, okay, that's a very good question.\n\nEpisode three, season one.\n\nAnd I appear in The Righteous Gemstones\n\nin a bathtub for the very first time.\n\nAnd I stand up and I am naked in that bathtub.\n\nIt wasn't my actual body and it wasn't my anatomy.\n\nIt was a 78-year-old stand-in\n\nthat they flew in from Chicago.\n\nI got a call after the first...\n\nThat episode appeared,\n\nand a really good friend of mine said,\n\nmy God, your body looks so good, Walton.\n\nWhat?\n\nIt's not my body.\n\nThat's a 78-year-old stand-in.\n\nNext.\n\nWalton Goggins, Vice Principals.\n\nMm hmm.\n\nThat was literally one of the greatest\n\nexperiences of my life, honest to check.\n\nWalton Goggins on The Shield.\n\nLet's segue into a drama.\n\nAgain, another one of the greatest experiences of my life.\n\nWe filmed it in Los Angeles.\n\nMichael Chiklis and Kenny Johnson\n\nare still some of my best friends today.\n\nWe did The Shield over seven years.\n\nIt totaled 84 hours of television.\n\nThe Sopranos were on at the same time that we were.\n\nBut no one, no actor had been given the opportunity\n\nto play the same character in a serialized format\n\nfor 84 hours.\n\nWe had no idea that we were astronauts\n\nkind of in this world, if you will.\n\nAnd when we shot the pilot,\n\nno one had any idea that seven years later\n\nwe would be ending this story,\n\nhaving explored every aspect\n\nof their psychology, if you will.\n\nIt was and will remain\n\none of the greatest experiences of my life.\n\nNext.\n\nThank you.\n\nWalton Goggins.\n\nHey, I know him.\n\nWalton Goggins, Venus Van Dam.\n\nOh, now this is my girl, Venus Van Dam.\n\nKurt Sutter, the writer of Sons of Anarchy,\n\nwas one of the main writers on The Shield,\n\na very, very dear friend of mine.\n\nAnd the truth is, this is a true story.\n\nHe did an an interview where he said that\n\nthe only two people that I could never have on my show\n\nare Michael Chiklis and Walton Goggins,\n\nbecause no one could ever see them as anything\n\nbut their characters on The Shield.\n\nSomeone sent this article to me, I read it,\n\nI forwarded it to Kurt Sutter.\n\nAnd I said, you, [beep] you, man.\n\nI wouldn't do your show anyway.\n\nTrue story.\n\nI said, the only way that I would do your show\n\nis if I played a transgender.\n\nTwo years later, he sent me a text\n\nand he said, were you serious?\n\nAnd I said, about what?\n\nHe said, about playing a transgender.\n\nAnd I said, do you have pages?\n\nHe said, yes.\n\nHe sent them.\n\nI read them and it was one of the greatest things\n\nthat I had ever read.\n\nAnd it made me laugh and it broke my heart.\n\nAnd so I bought a pair of high heels\n\nwhile we were doing Django Unchained.\n\nAnd I walked the streets of New Orleans\n\nafter wrap at like midnight every night\n\nfor the better part of a month, just to get used to it.\n\nIf you can walk on high heels on cobblestone streets,\n\nyou could walk in them anywhere.\n\nI don't feel like I did that show\n\nbecause it took four and a half hours to get made up.\n\nI would come very early in the morning\n\nand no one outta respect for me\n\nand deference to Venus,\n\nno one ever saw that transition\n\nexcept the people that were working on it.\n\nCharlie and Kim and all the boys on the show\n\nonly ever met me as Venus Van Dam.\n\nWe had been friends for years before that,\n\nbut they never talked to me as Walton.\n\nThey only referred to me as Venus.\n\nAnd they treated me like the lady that I was.\n\nIt will remain one of the...\n\nAlso one of the greatest experiences of my life.\n\nWalton Goggins, White Lotus.\n\nLet me just say that again.\n\nWalton Goggins, White Lotus, season three,\n\nfilming it right now in Thailand.\n\nMike White has a unique way in which he observes the world.\n\nHe is able to articulate\n\nthrough dialogue an existential crisis of people\n\nthat is applicable to people from all walks of life,\n\nfrom all of these different character voices.\n\nAnd the thing about Mike White,\n\nwhich not a lot of people know outside of the business,\n\nis he writes all of it.\n\nHe does it all himself.\n\nOkay, Walton Goggins, Shanghai Noon.\n\nYeah, I did that.\n\nThere was a time in my life where I...\n\nI don't know if I manifested it,\n\nbut I just kind of concentrated on people\n\nthat I wanted to work with.\n\nAnd it started with Robert Duvall\n\nand I did The Apostle with Robert Duvall.\n\nAbout four months after I spent obsessing over\n\nthe fact that I wanted to work with Robert Duvall.\n\nOwen Wilson?\n\nI did the same thing.\n\nBottle Rocket was one of my favorite movies\n\nand remains this day to be one of my favorite movies.\n\nAnd Owen was the guy that I really wanted to work with.\n\nLo and behold, I got a call to come in\n\nand meet with Tom Dey, the director,\n\nand got the role of this movie with Owen\n\nand we became friends over the course of making it.\n\nAnd he is everything that I hoped he would be.\n\nIt was a great experience.\n\nWatch this.\n\nWell, that's it.\n\nWe're out of boards.\n\nI've never really thought about questions\n\nthat people ask when they Google my name,\n\nbut this has been illuminating in many, many ways.\n\nI hope that this satiates your curiosity.\n\nThank you very much for Googling me.\n\n[upbeat music]", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image":

secret?\n\nVibrato takes a long time.\n\nAs with every little technique, you kind of get it\n\nand then you're doing one little thing wrong\n\nand then it all kind of falls apart.\n\nVibrato is when you're...\n\n[violin playing]\n\nYou can see my last knuckle is kind of flexing a little bit\n\nand I'm moving the hand like this, not like this.\n\nAnd...\n\n[violin playing]\n\nBut just be patient.\n\nIt's just muscle memory.\n\nIt takes a long time.\n\nYou'll get it.\n\nOkay, this is from cowboiklaus.\n\nHow expensive are violins?\n\nLike I'm asking for a friend.\n\nViolins are quite expensive.\n\nBaffles me sometimes like a vintage guitar\n\nthat's super cool\n\nand sexy-looking is still somewhat affordable.\n\nTo get a violin that starts to be just playable\n\nand decent, not much under eight grand or 10 grand.\n\nThey just don't sound very good.\n\nI don't know why that is.\n\nIt's an art.\n\nIt's really tricky to shave down the wood thin enough.\n\nThere's a lot of nuance to making a good violin.\n\nThe market is very, it's very high.\n\nEmKenWheel.\n\nI've never understood how to hold a violin bow properly.\n\nAnother one that takes longer than almost anything\n\nto get with playing the violin,\n\nmore than figuring out where your fingers go\n\nis the bow technique 'cause it's a bit abstract.\n\nWhen I used to teach, I would tell my students\n\nto pretend that they're lying in a canoe\n\nand they've got their arm draped over the side in the water\n\nand they're dragging their arm through the water.\n\nYou got a very light touch on the bow.\n\nAny kind of like, death grip on the bow makes it not work.\n\nSo you got the bare minimum pressure on the bow,\n\nand your wrist is a hinge.\n\nAnd you're kind of leading this way\n\nand everything's trailing behind,\n\nlike dragging through the wind.\n\nThis one's from _Aware_Wolf.\n\nIs there a difference between a fiddle and a violin?\n\nOr is it that one of the players is classically trained\n\nand the other has a recipe for possum?\n\nWell, you don't need to get into stereotypes here.\n\nLet's just say it's basically function of it.\n\nViolin is listening music,\n\nand fiddle is functional, dance music.\n\nAnd the techniques,\n\ncreating your own backbeat, that's fiddle playing.\n\nIt tends to be a little rougher around the edges\n\nbecause the point of it\n\nis to drive social dance situations.\n\nSo social music versus like, listening music.\n\nViolin versus fiddle.\n\nBut otherwise,\n\nthere's no difference in the instrument itself.\n\nAnd this one is FishyIrfan.\n\nI should have attended a pre-concert explanation\n\nabout the difference between baroque violin\n\nand modern violin technique.\n\nThe main difference is there's little to no vibrato\n\nin baroque violin.\n\nAnd that means Mozart\n\nis really not supposed to be played vibrato\n\nif you want to be accurate\n\n'cause it sounds a little more like fiddle music in a way.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nAnd it's very resonant, and early music is very.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nLike, that's a sympathetic resonation of I'm playing\n\na D on the G-string.\n\nSo I have an open D next to it\n\nso it creates this extra resonance.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nWhereas I would play a C right below it,\n\nthere is no sympathetic sea stringing to that saw.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nIt's a little more dry-sounding.\n\nSo it's like natural reverb,\n\nwhen you get that extra string vibrating next to it.\n\n'Cause the sound waves go off of the string\n\nand hit the string next to it,\n\nand if it's the same note,\n\nit'll start vibrating sympathetically.\n\nThis is from pateverman.\n\nI must know the secrets\n\nof how to make the Stradivarius violet.\n\nWell a lot of people have been trying to figure that out.\n\nIt's a beautiful sound, but it's a very specific sound.\n\nIt's not always what you want.\n\nThe Stradivarius is an ancient instrument,\n\nand it is a more focused and goes into other senses.\n\nIt's like a, you know, succulent kind of sound.\n\nRich and dark, very dark.\n\nI mean first of all,\n\nthey were made in the 16 hundreds, generally, 17.\n\nIt was a family business,\n\nso it stretched over a period of time.\n\nSome say it's the particular wood that they sourced\n\nor the way they treated it or the way they've varnished it.\n\nScientists have taken this on as like a little project\n\n'cause they think, Oh there must be some quantifiable way\n\nto recreate the Stradivarius.\n\nAnd they've learned some interesting things,\n\nbut no one's really been able to quite pull it off.\n\nColin, it's 7619.\n\nThe violin doesn't work because there's no rosin.\n\nWTF is rosin.\n\nThe rosin is what makes the horse hair on the bow\n\ngrip a string and cause it to resonate.\n\nYou take this stuff, some sort of a resin,\n\njust go like that.\n\nComes off and you don't need much.\n\nIf you touch the bow with your hand,\n\nthe grease or oils from your hand will cause it to slick\n\nand it'll just go [shushing].\n\nIt'll just be like, it won't grip.\n\nThis one is from aileenyhaha.\n\nWould anyone please teach me how to use a loop pedal?\n\nCould be key for solo gigs.\n\nI've been using this loop pedal for years.\n\nIt's from the mid nineties.\n\nThe chip in it is apparently ancient.\n\nAnd it has a loop function where you get either 26 seconds\n\nto make a phrase\n\nthat once you click record again, it starts over that phrase\n\nand keeps recording so you can layer on top of that.\n\nThat's our loop.\n\nI usually start with pizzicato.\n\nIt's like playing the violin like a guitar.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nSo I'll start a phrase like this.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nSo I just sort of improvised\n\nsomething that's sort of polyrhythmic, has a groove to it.\n\nSo I've got my rhythmic skeleton here,\n\nand then I might improvise something on top of that.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nSo that just started out as like a novel way\n\nto expand this otherwise linear instrument\n\ninto like a cordal instrument, and just to try out ideas.\n\nSamSaltyScience.\n\nAnyone know how to properly tune a violin?\n\nGoogling and tuning apps are only getting me so far.\n\nUsually you start with A.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nThe violin is in fifths, the interval is fifths.\n\nGuitars are in fourths, so...\n\n[violin playing]\n\nYou get used to the sound\n\nof what a fifth being in tune sounds like.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nYou can actually hear this like [chattering] sound of these,\n\nthe sound waves fighting against,\n\nand being out of sync with each other.\n\nBut when they get in sync, it all...\n\n[violin playing]\n\nSo there's flat.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nWhen I'm turning the tuning peg up,\n\nbringing the D-ring up to the A string\n\nand you hear dissonant dissonant undertones,\n\ndoesn't sound right and then suddenly ah,\n\nyou know, satisfaction.\n\nIt's a perfect fifth.\n\nStayMoment.\n\nHow do violin players not go effing deaf\n\nwith that shit near their ears?\n\nSince the advent of amplification,\n\nwe've got worse things to worry about\n\nthan the acoustic instrument\n\nbeing somewhat close to your ears.\n\nBut they do.\n\nMost violinists have hearing loss in their left ear\n\nfrom playing, you know, right here.\n\nAnd that's just a fact.\n\nI'm sure I do.\n\nW-L-W kaeya.\n\nThis is a genuine question for violin players\n\n'cause I don't know\n\nif y'all just can't follow tempo for some reason,\n\nbut why is it that every violinist I've ever seen\n\nspeeds up any song they play?\n\nAny instrumentalist might have trouble speeding up,\n\nespecially when you get in front of a bunch of people\n\nin a performance and the adrenaline kicks in.\n\nThe natural inclination is to speed up.\n\nAll players have to develop a good sense of time.\n\nPlaying with a drummer certainly helps.\n\nThat's why a lot of live records, it feels great\n\nfor everybody at the time, the audience and the players,\n\nbut you listen to the recording, you're like,\n\nOh, this is not gonna stand up on an album\n\nbecause it's too exciting.\n\nIt doesn't stand up to repeated listens.\n\nBut it doesn't mean it's not right in the moment.\n\nI'm guilty of it sometimes,\n\nbut it's usually when I'm playing a big show\n\nfor thousands of people and like, your adrenaline's way up.\n\nThe whole band gets that feeling.\n\nAll right,\n\nthat looks like that's all the questions for today.\n\nThanks so much.\n\nCarry on.\n\n[upbeat music]", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image":

{"title": "Lando Norris & Oscar Piastri Answer Formula 1 Questions From Twitter", "text": "Transcript\n\nI'm Lando Norris.\n\nAnd I'm Oscar Piastri.\n\nAnd we're from Team McLaren.\n\nAnd today, we're gonna answer\n\nsome questions from the internet.\n\nThis is Formula 1 Support.\n\n[deep bass playing]\n\nYou got a little question from @theulteriorkid.\n\nIs it true that F1 drivers can tell\n\nwhat course it is from just hearing\n\nan audio recording of it?\n\nI've seen people do it before.\n\nI feel like I'm gonna be terrible at this.\n\n[cars revving]\n\nWell, this is coming down the pit lane.\n\nPit lane, Yeah.\n\nLong pit lane.\n\nOkay.\n\nThis is a very slow corner.\n\nI reckon it's Bahrain.\n\nYeah, a quick turn to,\n\nYou think Bahrain, huh?\n\nI think Bahrain.\n\n[Producer] You're right.\n\n[Lando] It is. There you go.\n\nIt's true.\n\nIt's possible.\n\nTheulteriorkid, it's true. Yeah.\n\nSo, that was just done via our knowledge\n\nof distance of pit exit.\n\nYeah.\n\nTo turn one.\n\nThe distance from the pit lane\n\nto the first corner is always different\n\ndepending on the track.\n\nIt sounded like we got up to like, I don't know,\n\nfifth gear or sixth gear and then we went down\n\na lot of gears, which means it's a slow corner.\n\nAnd then, the next corner seemed pretty quick.\n\nI thought it would be Bahrain.\n\nSo, there you go.\n\nFrom, @jswallow123.\n\nI wonder why F1 drivers have to get weighed after a race.\n\nDo you know why?\n\nSo, we have a minimum weight limit\n\nof 798 kilograms, including the car.\n\nThat's why we get weighed just to make sure\n\nthat we're not under the weight limit,\n\n'cause obviously that's an advantage.\n\nWe do lose weight 'cause we're sweating,\n\nwe're working hard.\n\nDoesn't always look it, but we are.\n\nSometimes you have a very hot race, you can lose a lot.\n\nYou can lose easily three, four kilograms.\n\nThe most weight I've ever lost is probably,\n\nyeah three, three and a bit kilos.\n\nAnd yeah, often we weigh ourselves\n\nbefore the session as well,\n\nbecause then the engineers have a good idea\n\nof what we're gonna weigh so that we're not underweight\n\nin the score flight.\n\nFrom Juaann_14, What do you think\n\nis the hardest track in F1?\n\nI think Monaco.\n\nProbably Monaco.\n\nMonaco or Singapore.\n\n[Lando] Easiest one to crash.\n\n[Oscar] Yeah.\n\n[Lando] Easiest one to make mistakes.\n\nYeah.\n\nMost demanding.\n\nYou just can't make a mistake.\n\nSimple as that.\n\nYou make one little mistake, you're on the wall.\n\nThat's game over. Game over.\n\nFrom @ashlikesracing.\n\nWhat's your favorite F1 rivalry?\n\nI think for me, probably Senna versus Prost,\n\nI think it's probably the most famous one.\n\nWe are rivals.\n\nWe are rivals, yeah.\n\nI wanna beat him and he wants to be me.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut, we have to pretend that we're besties.\n\nI think we both have the same goals.\n\nWe both wanna win.\n\nThe quickest way into achieving that\n\n[Oscar] is by working together, Yeah.\n\nhelping one another.\n\nJust helping the team score the most points possible.\n\nAs soon as you put their helmet on,\n\nyou kind of fight for yourself,\n\nbut you also fight for the team.\n\nYou just have to get that balance correct.\n\nPoints, you get 25 if you win.\n\nYou get 18 if you second,\n\n15 if you're third, 12 if you're fourth.\n\nAnd then, once you get to fifth it's 10,\n\nand then it keeps dropping by twos\n\nuntil you get to 10th, you get one point.\n\nAnd then anyone finishes from 11th to 20th,\n\nthey don't get any points.\n\nYou also get a fastest lap point if you get the fastest lap.\n\nSometimes you'll see us make a bit of an unexpected pit stop\n\nor push really hard for one lap.\n\nThat's 'cause we're trying to get\n\nan extra point for the fastest lap.\n\nAnd points mean prizes And points mean prizes.\n\n[Lando] More points you get, More prizes you get,\n\nthe more money you get.\n\n@nickscotney,\n\nHow critical is a front wing in today's F1?\n\nVery. Yes.\n\n[Oscar] It's huge. Yeah.\n\nIt's like as soon as you have a little bit of damage,\n\nYou know about it.\n\nOh, you know about it straightaway.\n\nThis is it.\n\nThis is the front wing.\n\nYep.\n\nBit of the front nose.\n\nYep. And the front wing.\n\nEverything on the car is pretty much aimed\n\nat trying to push the car into ground.\n\nThat's how you get more grip.\n\nThat's down force.\n\nThat just pushes the car down, pushes the tires down,\n\n[Oscar] gives you more grip. Yeah.\n\nBasically makes you go quicker.\n\nSo, this is crucial when you're steering.\n\n[Oscar] Yep.\n\nYou take this off, you'll turn into a corner,\n\nthere's no load, there's no grip on the front tires.\n\nYou'll just go straight on.\n\nJust as important as this is, the rear wing,\n\nwhich Oscar's pre-prepared,\n\nbasically does the same thing but at the back of the car.\n\n[Oscar] Yeah. Pitches the car down,\n\ngives you a lot more rear grip.\n\nIt'll be difficult to even complete a lap.\n\nYou would spin a lot and probably crash a lot.\n\nThese are like everything to us.\n\n[Oscar] Yeah.\n\nThese are magical.\n\nThe other thing is the car is designed\n\nto have a front wing on it so the rest of,\n\nif you take the front wing off,\n\nthe rest of the car doesn't really work either.\n\nBut, the air goes through the front wing first, obviously.\n\nAnd then, it goes like to the floor.\n\nIt goes to the rear wing.\n\nSo, if you lose the front wing or the air,\n\ndoesn't get directed where it needs to go.\n\nAnd then, you have even more problems\n\nthen just losing the front wing.\n\n@Nuttymedium asks, What's the driver's visibility like?\n\nPretty bad.\n\n[Oscar] You see your car. Yeah.\n\nThe first bit of like ground that you can see like,\n\nprobably 10 meters ahead.\n\nWhen you're driving, you're kind of just focusing\n\non what's ahead of you.\n\nEven like, you know we have the halo,\n\nprotects our head, but you don't really see it\n\nbecause similar to like your nose,\n\nyou're looking far enough ahead that it kind of,\n\nyour mind just blurs it out.\n\nBut because you're looking 20 meters ahead, 30 meters ahead,\n\nand you get your own sense of gears.\n\nLike we have the gear number on our screen.\n\nMaybe you do.\n\nI never look at it. I never look at it.\n\nLike, you just do it off of sound.\n\nYou do it off of memory, Yeah.\n\noff of feeling.\n\nWhen we pull up to the pit stop sometimes\n\nand we have people all around the car,\n\nyou don't wanna hurt anyone.\n\nBut you also wanna gain\n\nevery little bit of lab time possible.\n\nSo, you push it as much as you can.\n\nBut, we still make mistakes.\n\nWe misjudge it sometimes.\n\nSometimes you kind of lock up.\n\n[Oscar] Yeah.\n\nYou hit the guy but he's ready to kind of absorb\n\na bit of the impact.\n\nAnd then he jacks the car up to change the tires,\n\nput it back down and you go.\n\nThe first time you do it, you know you enter very slowly.\n\nAnd you kind of slowly start to learn\n\nhow much you can push it, and exactly how long\n\nand why the car is.\n\nBut, that's something that takes time.\n\nWe also have like a board\n\nthat we kind of line our tires up with.\n\nSo, we have like a good reference\n\nand we can't see much out of the car\n\nbut we can see a little bit sort of the top of the tires\n\nand a little bit above that.\n\nOtherwise, you probably see a lot more people getting hit.\n\nSo, our next question is from @B4wekiss.\n\nHow do drivers know that it's time for a pit stop?\n\nOur engineer just tells us.\n\nUltimately, we can decide if we don't want to or not.\n\nUsually, there's a pretty good reason\n\nwhy they would call us into the pit lane.\n\nYou kinda pit for two reasons.\n\nActually, you can have three reasons.\n\nOne, you've got damage.\n\nTwo, the tires are wearing out.\n\nThe tire's made of rubber.\n\nOver time that wears down.\n\nThe less rubber you have, the less grip you have.\n\nSo, at a certain point it's better\n\nto come into the pits, put new tires on.\n\nThey're always talking to us about\n\nhow our tires are going, whether we think we can keep going,\n\nand if it gets really bad,\n\nwhether we can keep the car on the track.\n\nSometimes you might just pit\n\nbecause the guy behind you is pit.\n\nUndercut is when someone pits before you,\n\nputs on fresh tires and then by the time that you pit,\n\nyou actually come out behind them.\n\nOvercut, which is actually the opposite of that.\n\nYou put on fresh tires but really the fresh tires\n\naren't that much better\n\nor maybe they're difficult to warm up.\n\nIt's actually better to go for a bit longer, pit later,\n\nand maybe you overtake someone that way.\n\nThat's when you get into the more technical stuff\n\nwith strategy, which is a big part of racing.\n\nSo, there's a lot of communication around\n\nthat side of things.\n\nSo, you kind of wanna be able to communicate\n\nwith your team without giving away too much information\n\nbecause all the other teams can listen\n\nto each other's radio.\n\nIt's why you never hear anyone say\n\nwhat lap they're gonna pit,\n\n'cause then you tell the whole pit lane\n\nwhat your strategy is.\n\nFrom AmberLoungeLtd.\n\nWhat's your favorite F1 car shape?\n\nWell, we grew up watching like 2010s, or late 2000s.\n\nSo, the old cars, like Lando's holding, look really cool.\n\nMuch more simple than what we have now.\n\n[Lando] The McLaren MP4 2B 1985 Prost car.\n\n[Oscar] Yeah.\n\nI think I've driven this one.\n\nI think I drove it in Sonoma.\n\nAll right.\n\nJust everything's cool about it.\n\nYeah. Everything.\n\nThe colors, the look.\n\nSounds incredible as well.\n\nFor me, sound is a big part of everything.\n\n[Oscar] Yeah.\n\nCars nowadays, sound terrible.\n\nThese sound way better.\n\nVery little technology.\n\nEverything here is to do with technology.\n\nHow they build it, how they design it.\n\n[Oscar] Yeah.\n\nMake it, it just drives differently.\n\nVery different.\n\nNo power steering.\n\nNow, we have power steering.\n\nSo, from step one to the end,\n\nbasically everything is changed\n\nor a lot more advanced nowadays.\n\nFrom @MaybellineGrace,\n\nDo all F1 drivers have a max speed of 241 miles an hour?\n\nFastest clocked has been 241 miles an hour.\n\nIt feels pretty quick going at that speed.\n\nIt depends on the car you're in,\n\ndepends on this track,\n\ndepends if you're in a slipstream as well.\n\nIf you've got a car in front of you,\n\nliterally punches a hole in the air for you\n\nso you have less drag and you can go faster.\n\nYou don't really realize how fast you're going\n\nuntil you see like, on your dash.\n\nWe'll just hit the throttle pedal as hard as we can.\n\nIt's not down to us, it's down to the car.\n\nIt depends a lot on the track as well.\n\nHow long the straight is.\n\nSo, when we race in Monaco for example,\n\nwe race with the most amount of down force on the car.\n\nSo, the top speed is very low.\n\nBut, when we go to somewhere like Monza,\n\nwe run the lowest amount of down force.\n\nWe go much faster on the straits.\n\nFrom T_angge,\n\nHi Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.\n\nI have a question for both of you.\n\nWhat are your rituals or warmups you do\n\nbefore going onto the race?\n\nI always do like a physical warmup before the race.\n\nSome skipping, some stretches.\n\nI lie on my bed.\n\nI have a little massage.\n\nI listen to some music.\n\nThe more chilled I can be, the better.\n\nOne other thing we do\n\na few days before the race is walk the track.\n\nTo see if there's anything new\n\nthat's changed from the year before,\n\nor if it's a new circuit or a track we haven't been to.\n\nJust looking at the curbs, what things to avoid,\n\nwhat places you definitely don't wanna over push.\n\nWhat places you can push.\n\nYou know, places you don't wanna make mistakes\n\nor you can't afford to make mistakes.\n\nDifferent things like that.\n\nWe talk a lot about the strategy before the race.\n\nSo we have some plans about\n\nwhat we might wanna do in the race.\n\nIf there's one pit stop or two or three, we'll have plans\n\nthat might have different amount of pit stops.\n\nNext question we got from @samuraisofree.\n\nHow does one train become an F1 driver\n\nso that they can also have cat-like reflexes?\n\nWe trained from a very early age,\n\nbut luckily, I got a pair of balls.\n\nLet's put it to the test.\n\nI wanna test you.\n\nThere's many different ways of doing things.\n\nHere's one of them.\n\nYeah.\n\nAre you ready?\n\nAs ready as I'll ever be.\n\nUh huh.\n\nThere you go.\n\nOh!\n\nThree.\n\n[laughter]\n\nOh, you got it.\n\nEvery driver does something different.\n\nI use these lights, which come on,\n\nyou have to react to the lights.\n\nYou can also get these glasses, which like flicker.\n\nOh yeah.\n\nThis also helps your reactions a little bit more.\n\nNext question is from @bybrandonwhite.\n\nDo F1 drivers accelerate or break on curves?\n\nSo, on the corners, what's the strategy with that?\n\nNormally, you break before the corner.\n\nIf you're coming from a really long straight\n\ninto a slow corner, you need to break a lot more\n\nthan if you're coming into a fast corner\n\nor you know you're coming out of a slow corner\n\nand then you've got another corner.\n\nThat's why you see it's lock up\n\nbecause we're trying to break as much as we can.\n\nThat's the strategy with that one.\n\nSo, those are all the questions for today.\n\nThank you very much for watching Formula 1 Support.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image": "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill,d_placeholder_wired.png,fl_progressive,g_face,h_1080,q_80,w_1920/v1717695609/wired_tech-support-lando-norris-and-oscar-piastri-answer-formula-1-questions-from-twitter.jpg", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "Lando Norris & Oscar Piastri Answer Formula 1 Questions From Twitter", "text": "Transcript\n\nI'm Lando Norris.\n\nAnd I'm Oscar Piastri.\n\nAnd we're from Team McLaren.\n\nAnd today, we're gonna answer\n\nsome questions from the internet.\n\nThis is Formula 1 Support.\n\n[deep bass playing]\n\nYou got a little question from @theulteriorkid.\n\nIs it true that F1 drivers can tell\n\nwhat course it is from just hearing\n\nan audio recording of it?\n\nI've seen people do it before.\n\nI feel like I'm gonna be terrible at this.\n\n[cars revving]\n\nWell, this is coming down the pit lane.\n\nPit lane, Yeah.\n\nLong pit lane.\n\nOkay.\n\nThis is a very slow corner.\n\nI reckon it's Bahrain.\n\nYeah, a quick turn to,\n\nYou think Bahrain, huh?\n\nI think Bahrain.\n\n[Producer] You're right.\n\n[Lando] It is. There you go.\n\nIt's true.\n\nIt's possible.\n\nTheulteriorkid, it's true. Yeah.\n\nSo, that was just done via our knowledge\n\nof distance of pit exit.\n\nYeah.\n\nTo turn one.\n\nThe distance from the pit lane\n\nto the first corner is always different\n\ndepending on the track.\n\nIt sounded like we got up to like, I don't know,\n\nfifth gear or sixth gear and then we went down\n\na lot of gears, which means it's a slow corner.\n\nAnd then, the next corner seemed pretty quick.\n\nI thought it would be Bahrain.\n\nSo, there you go.\n\nFrom, @jswallow123.\n\nI wonder why F1 drivers have to get weighed after a race.\n\nDo you know why?\n\nSo, we have a minimum weight limit\n\nof 798 kilograms, including the car.\n\nThat's why we get weighed just to make sure\n\nthat we're not under the weight limit,\n\n'cause obviously that's an advantage.\n\nWe do lose weight 'cause we're sweating,\n\nwe're working hard.\n\nDoesn't always look it, but we are.\n\nSometimes you have a very hot race, you can lose a lot.\n\nYou can lose easily three, four kilograms.\n\nThe most weight I've ever lost is probably,\n\nyeah three, three and a bit kilos.\n\nAnd yeah, often we weigh ourselves\n\nbefore the session as well,\n\nbecause then the engineers have a good idea\n\nof what we're gonna weigh so that we're not underweight\n\nin the score flight.\n\nFrom Juaann_14, What do you think\n\nis the hardest track in F1?\n\nI think Monaco.\n\nProbably Monaco.\n\nMonaco or Singapore.\n\n[Lando] Easiest one to crash.\n\n[Oscar] Yeah.\n\n[Lando] Easiest one to make mistakes.\n\nYeah.\n\nMost demanding.\n\nYou just can't make a mistake.\n\nSimple as that.\n\nYou make one little mistake, you're on the wall.\n\nThat's game over. Game over.\n\nFrom @ashlikesracing.\n\nWhat's your favorite F1 rivalry?\n\nI think for me, probably Senna versus Prost,\n\nI think it's probably the most famous one.\n\nWe are rivals.\n\nWe are rivals, yeah.\n\nI wanna beat him and he wants to be me.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut, we have to pretend that we're besties.\n\nI think we both have the same goals.\n\nWe both wanna win.\n\nThe quickest way into achieving that\n\n[Oscar] is by working together, Yeah.\n\nhelping one another.\n\nJust helping the team score the most points possible.\n\nAs soon as you put their helmet on,\n\nyou kind of fight for yourself,\n\nbut you also fight for the team.\n\nYou just have to get that balance correct.\n\nPoints, you get 25 if you win.\n\nYou get 18 if you second,\n\n15 if you're third, 12 if you're fourth.\n\nAnd then, once you get to fifth it's 10,\n\nand then it keeps dropping by twos\n\nuntil you get to 10th, you get one point.\n\nAnd then anyone finishes from 11th to 20th,\n\nthey don't get any points.\n\nYou also get a fastest lap point if you get the fastest lap.\n\nSometimes you'll see us make a bit of an unexpected pit stop\n\nor push really hard for one lap.\n\nThat's 'cause we're trying to get\n\nan extra point for the fastest lap.\n\nAnd points mean prizes And points mean prizes.\n\n[Lando] More points you get, More prizes you get,\n\nthe more money you get.\n\n@nickscotney,\n\nHow critical is a front wing in today's F1?\n\nVery. Yes.\n\n[Oscar] It's huge. Yeah.\n\nIt's like as soon as you have a little bit of damage,\n\nYou know about it.\n\nOh, you know about it straightaway.\n\nThis is it.\n\nThis is the front wing.\n\nYep.\n\nBit of the front nose.\n\nYep. And the front wing.\n\nEverything on the car is pretty much aimed\n\nat trying to push the car into ground.\n\nThat's how you get more grip.\n\nThat's down force.\n\nThat just pushes the car down, pushes the tires down,\n\n[Oscar] gives you more grip. Yeah.\n\nBasically makes you go quicker.\n\nSo, this is crucial when you're steering.\n\n[Oscar] Yep.\n\nYou take this off, you'll turn into a corner,\n\nthere's no load, there's no grip on the front tires.\n\nYou'll just go straight on.\n\nJust as important as this is, the rear wing,\n\nwhich Oscar's pre-prepared,\n\nbasically does the same thing but at the back of the car.\n\n[Oscar] Yeah. Pitches the car down,\n\ngives you a lot more rear grip.\n\nIt'll be difficult to even complete a lap.\n\nYou would spin a lot and probably crash a lot.\n\nThese are like everything to us.\n\n[Oscar] Yeah.\n\nThese are magical.\n\nThe other thing is the car is designed\n\nto have a front wing on it so the rest of,\n\nif you take the front wing off,\n\nthe rest of the car doesn't really work either.\n\nBut, the air goes through the front wing first, obviously.\n\nAnd then, it goes like to the floor.\n\nIt goes to the rear wing.\n\nSo, if you lose the front wing or the air,\n\ndoesn't get directed where it needs to go.\n\nAnd then, you have even more problems\n\nthen just losing the front wing.\n\n@Nuttymedium asks, What's the driver's visibility like?\n\nPretty bad.\n\n[Oscar] You see your car. Yeah.\n\nThe first bit of like ground that you can see like,\n\nprobably 10 meters ahead.\n\nWhen you're driving, you're kind of just focusing\n\non what's ahead of you.\n\nEven like, you know we have the halo,\n\nprotects our head, but you don't really see it\n\nbecause similar to like your nose,\n\nyou're looking far enough ahead that it kind of,\n\nyour mind just blurs it out.\n\nBut because you're looking 20 meters ahead, 30 meters ahead,\n\nand you get your own sense of gears.\n\nLike we have the gear number on our screen.\n\nMaybe you do.\n\nI never look at it. I never look at it.\n\nLike, you just do it off of sound.\n\nYou do it off of memory, Yeah.\n\noff of feeling.\n\nWhen we pull up to the pit stop sometimes\n\nand we have people all around the car,\n\nyou don't wanna hurt anyone.\n\nBut you also wanna gain\n\nevery little bit of lab time possible.\n\nSo, you push it as much as you can.\n\nBut, we still make mistakes.\n\nWe misjudge it sometimes.\n\nSometimes you kind of lock up.\n\n[Oscar] Yeah.\n\nYou hit the guy but he's ready to kind of absorb\n\na bit of the impact.\n\nAnd then he jacks the car up to change the tires,\n\nput it back down and you go.\n\nThe first time you do it, you know you enter very slowly.\n\nAnd you kind of slowly start to learn\n\nhow much you can push it, and exactly how long\n\nand why the car is.\n\nBut, that's something that takes time.\n\nWe also have like a board\n\nthat we kind of line our tires up with.\n\nSo, we have like a good reference\n\nand we can't see much out of the car\n\nbut we can see a little bit sort of the top of the tires\n\nand a little bit above that.\n\nOtherwise, you probably see a lot more people getting hit.\n\nSo, our next question is from @B4wekiss.\n\nHow do drivers know that it's time for a pit stop?\n\nOur engineer just tells us.\n\nUltimately, we can decide if we don't want to or not.\n\nUsually, there's a pretty good reason\n\nwhy they would call us into the pit lane.\n\nYou kinda pit for two reasons.\n\nActually, you can have three reasons.\n\nOne, you've got damage.\n\nTwo, the tires are wearing out.\n\nThe tire's made of rubber.\n\nOver time that wears down.\n\nThe less rubber you have, the less grip you have.\n\nSo, at a certain point it's better\n\nto come into the pits, put new tires on.\n\nThey're always talking to us about\n\nhow our tires are going, whether we think we can keep going,\n\nand if it gets really bad,\n\nwhether we can keep the car on the track.\n\nSometimes you might just pit\n\nbecause the guy behind you is pit.\n\nUndercut is when someone pits before you,\n\nputs on fresh tires and then by the time that you pit,\n\nyou actually come out behind them.\n\nOvercut, which is actually the opposite of that.\n\nYou put on fresh tires but really the fresh tires\n\naren't that much better\n\nor maybe they're difficult to warm up.\n\nIt's actually better to go for a bit longer, pit later,\n\nand maybe you overtake someone that way.\n\nThat's when you get into the more technical stuff\n\nwith strategy, which is a big part of racing.\n\nSo, there's a lot of communication around\n\nthat side of things.\n\nSo, you kind of wanna be able to communicate\n\nwith your team without giving away too much information\n\nbecause all the other teams can listen\n\nto each other's radio.\n\nIt's why you never hear anyone say\n\nwhat lap they're gonna pit,\n\n'cause then you tell the whole pit lane\n\nwhat your strategy is.\n\nFrom AmberLoungeLtd.\n\nWhat's your favorite F1 car shape?\n\nWell, we grew up watching like 2010s, or late 2000s.\n\nSo, the old cars, like Lando's holding, look really cool.\n\nMuch more simple than what we have now.\n\n[Lando] The McLaren MP4 2B 1985 Prost car.\n\n[Oscar] Yeah.\n\nI think I've driven this one.\n\nI think I drove it in Sonoma.\n\nAll right.\n\nJust everything's cool about it.\n\nYeah.

What it do?\n\nThis is Method Man right here.\n\nAnd this is the Wired Autocomplete Interview.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nAll right.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nAll right.\n\nWhere did Method Man grow up?\n\nLong Island and Staten Island,\n\n'cause my moms, we moved to Staten Island\n\nfrom Brooklyn, actually.\n\nA place where you couldn't stay too long,\n\nkind of like a shelter, but not a shelter.\n\nThe lady that was one of the people that worked there,\n\nher and my mom got really tight\n\nand that's how we ended up in Staten Island.\n\nLong Island, I was born there,\n\nso always got a place in my heart\n\nfor Hempstead, Long Island as a whole, period.\n\nMethod Man, Da Rockwilder.\n\nThis record done by the person we named it after,\n\nI wanted to name it after him, show homage,\n\ncame up through the ranks with Eric Sherman, Redman,\n\nand those guys.\n\nRedman didn't like the record.\n\nIt wasn't that he didn't like the record,\n\nhe knew that Rockwilder could do way better,\n\n'cause like I said, they all came up through those ranks.\n\nSo he was a little bit harder on Rockwilder,\n\nbut it turned out to be a hit.\n\nRockwilder, microphone checker.\n\nMethod man Jay-Z tour.\n\nWell it was actually the Hard Knock Life Tour,\n\nyes, it was definitely Jay-Z's tour.\n\nShout out to Jay-Z, you're doing magnificent things, man,\n\nbig things for hip hop as well as our culture as a whole.\n\nWhen we were asked to go on that, we knew what it entailed,\n\nwe knew who the artists were.\n\nI mean DMX, Jay-Z, you know, those are heavyweights.\n\nSo myself and Redman being that we were already veterans\n\nin the game, we kind of fit right in.\n\nAnd plus, I'm pretty sure Jay knew what me and Redman\n\nwere capable of doing on stage,\n\nand it was a very successful tour.\n\nWe did 54 dates, all of 'em sold out, there was even,\n\nI mean, we was getting so much money\n\nwhen the thing happened in Columbine,\n\neverybody donated their paycheck,\n\nor rather their show money to that cause\n\nfor the kids that lost lives.\n\nWe probably would've did it anyway,\n\neven if we weren't getting money,\n\n'cause a sign of the times that's what it is.\n\nBut yeah, it was a pretty lucrative tour for everybody.\n\nMethod man, The Riddler, loved this record.\n\nActually the guitar riff is played by\n\nOld Dirty Brasstards' older brother.\n\nNot too many people know that, fun fact.\n\nwe did this in The RZA's basement before the flood.\n\nYou know, us Blerds, us black nerds,\n\nwe love our comic books.\n\nAnd when the opportunity presented itself, The Riddler.\n\nI knew off top that I wanted to do a bad guy song.\n\nThe riff that Old Dirty Brasstards' brother came up with\n\nwas perfect.\n\nAnd I believe The Riddler played\n\na major part in that album,\n\nthe whole soundtrack going 10 times platinum.\n\nI like to say that in my head,\n\nbut it was really Seal, Kiss from a Rose,\n\nand, U2, U2, U2 had a great record on there as well.\n\nYeah, The Riddler.\n\nBam.\n\nWhat's Happenin', Method Man.\n\nI don't know, chilling.\n\nActually that's a song that picked me.\n\nBusta had a record and he came to me and he was like,\n\nyou need this record, lord.\n\nAnd when Busta tell you you need a record,\n\nyou need a record.\n\nAnd it became the first single.\n\nSo yeah, What's Happenin'.\n\nWhat does tical mean?\n\nTical can mean a lot of things,\n\nbut right now it means the top is cold and lonely.\n\nWell, I mean it came from a word we used to use\n\nto describe trees, plants, flower.\n\nIt was a word made up by a friend\n\naround my way named Lounging Low.\n\nIt took on its own life,\n\nso yeah, tical means a lot of things,\n\nbut right now the top is cold and lonely.\n\nWhat the Blood Clot, Method Man.\n\nI was actually mad at the Clan when I wrote that record.\n\nI was on the airplane playing my radio at that right,\n\ntimes have changed, they would never let me do that now.\n\nBut I was playing my radio\n\nand I kept rewinding an Eric Sherman record called\n\nIt's All In The Mind,\n\nthat's what I wrote What The Blood Clot to.\n\nI remember 'cause we got into a big argument\n\nbefore we got on the plane and I was just mad at all of 'em.\n\nLike Wu-tang Clan ain't nothing to [beep] with,\n\n[beep] you guys.\n\nThe What, Method Man, Biggie.\n\nThis is crazy too, because I actually snuck\n\nto go do this record with Biggie,\n\nTracey Waples, salute to Traywap.\n\nShe came and scooped me up that night\n\nand like I said, I wasn't supposed to be doing any records\n\nwith anybody, I had my own album coming.\n\nWu-Tang had steam and we wanted to keep that in home,\n\nand the money as well.\n\nSo I went and did the Biggie record, Big was mad cool.\n\nContrary to what everybody believes,\n\nhe wrote his rhyme right there when I wrote mine.\n\nNobody was doing anything inside their head.\n\nAnd it was a fun time, man, The What, Method Man,\n\nBiggie, Brooklyn.\n\nAll right, I got me embellishing too much.\n\nIs Method Man in Power?\n\nYes, I'm in Power.\n\nI play Davis MacLean on Power, very savvy lawyer.\n\nAnybody that follows the Power universe\n\nknow that lawyers don't fare too well on this show.\n\nSo I think the fact that Davis is still alive\n\nfor this fourth and final season\n\nsays a lot about his character and a lot about me.\n\nIs Method Man in Trainwreck?\n\nYes, I'm in Trainwreck,\n\nhad a lot of fun with the old cat Norman,\n\nI forgot his last name, but he's been around forever.\n\nHe was actually in the scene with me, he was the older cat,\n\nthat used to talk about Babe Ruth all day.\n\nFirst time working with Judd Apatow, not my first time, no,\n\nas a matter of fact,\n\nit wasn't my first time working with him.\n\nI actually read for the movie he did with Adam Sandler\n\nthat RZA got.\n\nBut Judd said that it is his life's mission\n\nto have every Wu-Tang member in at least one of his films.\n\nSo he's got two down, he's got about seven more to go.\n\nTrainwreck, dope.\n\nShout out to Amy Schumer, hey muffin.\n\nIs Method Man a Jets fan?\n\nAbso-freaking-lutely.\n\nI'm a Long Island kid, I mean we grew up on Jets and Mets.\n\nNot too big on basketball, but Jets and Mets\n\nwere always synonymous with Long Island, Queens,\n\nyou know what I'm saying?\n\nNew York Sack Exchange, those guys,\n\nI mean even Richard Todd, you know what I mean?\n\nHe was my guy for a minute.\n\nWesley Walker, Freeman McNeil, the Big Tuna.\n\nWe had Keyshawn for a while, Rob Moore, who I grew up with,\n\nRob Moore was a wide receiver for the team.\n\nSo yeah, I've been a Jets fan for life.\n\nSalute.\n\nWhere did Method Man get his name?\n\nTook it from a [beep].\n\nNah, actually, it's a block name, like I said,\n\nwe had different terminology for trees\n\nand Method was one of the terms that we used\n\nto describe trees and I felt like the man.\n\nSo yeah, Method Man, just fit.\n\nIs Method Man in The Wire?\n\nYes, I am in The Wire,' but I am not wired\n\n'cause I'm no snitch.\n\nI actually played a character called\n\nMelvin Cheese Wagstaff, nephew of Prop Joe.\n\nCheese was a piece of work, I think Cheese was a survivor,\n\nbut anybody that watched the show\n\nwould think he's a piece of [beep].\n\nI won't give any spoilers away,\n\nbut he does something that's against code\n\nand he deserved everything that he got.\n\nIs Method Man going on tour?\n\nNo sir, Method Man is more focused on acting,\n\nthat is first position for me.\n\nSo unless the movie is about a tour,\n\nMethod Man will not be on tour anytime soon.\n\nBut we do actually have a residency in Vegas, Wu-Tang.\n\nIf you can catch it, come out, it's pretty fun.\n\nYou know, bring you and your old lady, no kids.\n\nMethod Man, best songs.\n\nI got one, one that I think is my best song\n\nand it's definitely All I Need, of course.\n\nGot me a Grammy.\n\nIt actually was Mary's first Grammy,\n\nshe's gotten plenty more after that as she should.\n\nThe fact that it was a song that I didn't even wanna put out\n\nand it did what it did,\n\njust shows how much I know about music.\n\n[Interviewer] Why didn't you wanna put it out?\n\nIn my eyes, it wasn't a traditional love song,\n\nbut it was still a love song, which wasn't in my idea,\n\nsomething that I wanted to put out at that point in time.\n\nLook, keep Googling, stop with whatever, man.\n\nI

What it do?\n\nThis is Method Man right here.\n\nAnd this is the Wired Autocomplete Interview.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nAll right.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nAll right.\n\nWhere did Method Man grow up?\n\nLong Island and Staten Island,\n\n'cause my moms, we moved to Staten Island\n\nfrom Brooklyn, actually.\n\nA place where you couldn't stay too long,\n\nkind of like a shelter, but not a shelter.\n\nThe lady that was one of the people that worked there,\n\nher and my mom got really tight\n\nand that's how we ended up in Staten Island.\n\nLong Island, I was born there,\n\nso always got a place in my heart\n\nfor Hempstead, Long Island as a whole, period.\n\nMethod Man, Da Rockwilder.\n\nThis record done by the person we named it after,\n\nI wanted to name it after him, show homage,\n\ncame up through the ranks with Eric Sherman, Redman,\n\nand those guys.\n\nRedman didn't like the record.\n\nIt wasn't that he didn't like the record,\n\nhe knew that Rockwilder could do way better,\n\n'cause like I said, they all came up through those ranks.\n\nSo he was a little bit harder on Rockwilder,\n\nbut it turned out to be a hit.\n\nRockwilder, microphone checker.\n\nMethod man Jay-Z tour.\n\nWell it was actually the Hard Knock Life Tour,\n\nyes, it was definitely Jay-Z's tour.\n\nShout out to Jay-Z, you're doing magnificent things, man,\n\nbig things for hip hop as well as our culture as a whole.\n\nWhen we were asked to go on that, we knew what it entailed,\n\nwe knew who the artists were.\n\nI mean DMX, Jay-Z, you know, those are heavyweights.\n\nSo myself and Redman being that we were already veterans\n\nin the game, we kind of fit right in.\n\nAnd plus, I'm pretty sure Jay knew what me and Redman\n\nwere capable of doing on stage,\n\nand it was a very successful tour.\n\nWe did 54 dates, all of 'em sold out, there was even,\n\nI mean, we was getting so much money\n\nwhen the thing happened in Columbine,\n\neverybody donated their paycheck,\n\nor rather their show money to that cause\n\nfor the kids that lost lives.\n\nWe probably would've did it anyway,\n\neven if we weren't getting money,\n\n'cause a sign of the times that's what it is.\n\nBut yeah, it was a pretty lucrative tour for everybody.\n\nMethod man, The Riddler, loved this record.\n\nActually the guitar riff is played by\n\nOld Dirty Brasstards' older brother.\n\nNot too many people know

{"title": "Biomedical Scientist Answers Pseudoscience Questions From Twitter", "text": "Transcript\n\nI'm Dr. Andrea Love, biomedical scientist.\n\nI fact check false health claims.\n\nThis is Pseudoscience Support.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\n@AwayFromTheKeys wants to know,\n\nhow do you define pseudoscience?\n\nSo pseudoscience refers to beliefs or practices\n\nthat appear scientific on the surface,\n\nbut they lack the repeatability, the reliability,\n\nor the credibility of science.\n\nOften they're making claims that are based on anecdotes,\n\nas opposed to evidence.\n\nThey often start with a nugget of truth,\n\nand then widely exaggerate that\n\nbeyond what reality would indicate.\n\n@Shannyxrae wants to know,\n\nshould I buy this flat tummy tea or not?\n\nAnyone tried it?\n\nI hate to break it to you,\n\nthat these things are really just glorified laxatives.\n\nSo what's happening is that\n\nyou're speeding up your digestive process\n\nbeyond what it should be normally.\n\nBut what you're flushing out is\n\nfood that you haven't finished digesting properly\n\nand absorbing their nutrients.\n\nSo you're creating a lot of diarrhea,\n\nand you're also dehydrating yourself.\n\nSo while you might feel like you have a very flat tummy,\n\nit's not because you're actually losing weight\n\nor removing toxins, it's simply because you've removed food\n\nto quickly from your body, and you're dehydrating yourself.\n\n@itssynecdoche is asking, why am I only just learning\n\nthat chiropractors are not real doctors?\n\nYeah.\n\nSo chiropractic is a $15 billion industry,\n\nand it was invented by a guy named Didi Palmer\n\nwho thought that ghosts were telling him to create it.\n\nThey believe that the joints and the nerves\n\nthat go through our body are the cause of every ailment\n\nthat we know of.\n\nUnfortunately, chiropractic is a full-on pseudoscience.\n\nThere are certain chiropractors\n\nthat maybe stay in the lane of more physical therapy,\n\nand there's a little bit of data to suggest that\n\nfor certain types of low back pain,\n\nchiropractic adjustment can offer temporary relief,\n\nbut it's not fixing a musculoskeletal problem,\n\nand it's definitely not doing\n\nthe other things that chiropractors claim to do.\n\nSo if you see the abbreviation DC\n\nafter someone's name on social media,\n\nthat means that they're a chiropractor,\n\nand they're not a medical or scientific expert.\n\n@pathogenflock, is it just me,\n\nor is belief in pseudoscience rising recently?\n\nThis is absolutely correct.\n\nWe have seen a dramatic rise in anti-science\n\nand pseudoscience beliefs,\n\nand this does trend with the prevalence of social media.\n\nAlso coincides with the recent Covid-19 pandemic\n\nand the increasing amount of politicization of vaccines.\n\nSo this past year,\n\nonly 93.1% of entering school age children\n\nreceived vaccinations for the MMR,\n\nthe measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.\n\nThis is a 2% drop compared to the previous school year,\n\nparticularly for a disease where you need\n\nat least 95% coverage to stop the spread of measles,\n\nthis is a very concerning trend.\n\n@gutznotguts wants to know\n\nhow the [bleep] did the vaccines cause autism myth\n\neven start?\n\nThis myth started in 1998\n\nbecause of a British gastroenterologist\n\nnamed Andrew Wakefield,\n\nwho has since lost his medical license\n\nand the ability to practice medicine.\n\nBut he published a paper in The Lancet,\n\nwhich is a very prestigious medical journal,\n\nand claimed that he had data to demonstrate\n\na link between the MMR vaccine,\n\nwhich is the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine\n\nand autism symptoms in children.\n\nThe problem was he falsified all of the data in that paper.\n\nMore than that, he used self-reports from parents\n\nwho were planning to sue the existing manufacturers\n\nof the MMR vaccine.\n\nOn top of that, he was trying to sell\n\nand market his own MMR vaccine,\n\nbut because it was published\n\nin such prestigious medical journal,\n\nit took the world by storm, it caused a lot of fear.\n\nEventually that paper was retracted,\n\nbut that retraction did not occur until 2010,\n\n12 years later.\n\nNow, in recent years, we're seeing measles rates\n\nabove what we have ever seen in the US,\n\nand it is really a cause for concern\n\nbecause the very first measles vaccine\n\nwas put on the market in 1963.\n\nSo we have over 60 years of data\n\nthat demonstrate that there is no relationship\n\nbetween vaccines and autism.\n\n@briney4trump, GMOs change our DNA every day\n\nand give people several diseases.\n\nWhy did we approve of this?\n\nThis is not true.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the papaya was being wiped out\n\nby a virus called the papaya ring spot virus.\n\nSo we created a GMO papaya\n\nthat can resist the papaya ring spot virus.\n\n90% of the papayas are GMO.\n\nAnd when you eat them, it is not changing your DNA.\n\nSo when you eat the papaya, you're eating all of its cells\n\nand all of those cells contain DNA.\n\nSo those DNA molecules are going to enter your stomach\n\nand it's gonna mix with an enzyme called pepsin.\n\nSo when the pepsin interacts with the DNA molecule,\n\nit blasted apart into all of these individual subunits,\n\nand therefore the DNA is no longer intact.\n\nIt's not gonna change your DNA,\n\nit's not gonna cause any harmful consequences.\n\n@JohnnyV45385760 wants to know,\n\nhow can you tell if a health influencer is legit\n\nor full of shit?\n\nSome of the red flags to look for are, number one,\n\nthey are trying to evoke very strong negative emotions.\n\nThings like fear, anxiety, or worry,\n\nparticularly as it relates to your health\n\nor the health of your children or your family.\n\nNumber two, they're making all or none statements.\n\nThey're saying that this thing is causing cancer,\n\nor this thing is going to fix some disorder.\n\nNumber three, if they're selling you something\n\nthat is related to the claims that they're making,\n\nwhether that is a supplement, or a diet plan,\n\nor a protocol, or a book.\n\nNumber four, if they have an obvious conflict of interest.\n\nAre they working for the company\n\nof the product that they're selling you?\n\nAnd last but not least, if they're speaking way outside\n\nof their area of expertise.\n\nIf someone is a neuroscientist\n\nthat specializes in optic nerve signaling,\n\nand they're pretending to be an expert\n\nin infectious disease immunology,\n\nthat's probably a red flag.\n\n@10000problems wants to know\n\nwhy does homeopathic medicine work\n\nso much better than real medicine?\n\nUnfortunately that is not the case.\n\nBut let me tell you a little bit about what homeopathy is,\n\n'cause it's often confused with\n\nother sorts of alternative remedies.\n\nHomeopathy is a pseudoscience that was created\n\nor invented in the 1700s by a German guy\n\nnamed Samuel Hahnemann.\n\nHe created this based on two beliefs.\n\nThe first is that like cures like,\n\nmeaning that if something causes a symptom,\n\nthat same substance can cure\n\nan ailment that creates that symptom.\n\nOnion causes watery eyes when you cut it.\n\nTherefore, homeopathic onion\n\nis going to cure things like allergies\n\nthat also cause watery eyes.\n\nBut that goes along with the second belief,\n\nor the law of infinite decimals.\n\nMeaning that the remedy becomes more potent\n\nthe more it is diluted.\n\nIf you find a label on a homeopathic remedy\n\nthat says 12C, C means 100, and 12 means that you've diluted\n\nthe substance 12 times a hundred fold over,\n\nwhich means you have one part in this many parts,\n\nwhich is also called one septillion.\n\nSo what that means is that\n\nthere's no actual active ingredient in that.\n\nThat is probably a good thing\n\nbecause there are many homeopathic remedies\n\nthat can be very dangerous\n\nif you would ingest them at normal dosage.\n\nFor example, teething tablets\n\nthat claim to have homeopathic belladonna,\n\nwhich is deadly nightshade,\n\nwere contaminated with measurable levels of belladonna,\n\nand hundreds of babies developed seizures,\n\nand at least 10 babies died.\n\nThis happened starting in 2010 and 2012,\n\nand there were several brands that were to blame.\n\nOne final danger of homeopathy is that\n\nmany people believe that they're taking something\n\nthat's beneficial, and beyond the fact that it is\n\nnothing more than a sugar pill,\n\nit often leads people to forego actual medical care,\n\nwhich is one of the biggest harms of all.\n\n@paul_metta555 asks,\n\nare cell phone towers detrimental to our health?\n\nWhy so many?\n\nWhy do they emit high pitch noises?\n\nAre they carcinogenic?\n\nWhy the spiking cancer rates since they arrived?\n\nCell phone towers look like this.\n\nYou have this primary node that's coming out from all sides,\n\nand you have these radio waves that are being emitted.\n\nYou also have these secondary nodes\n\nthat are a little bit smaller,\n\nbut all of these radio frequency waves\n\nare projected in every direction,\n\nbecause otherwise we wouldn't have cell reception.\n\nSo this myth kind of started because people heard the word\n\nradiofrequency radiation and got scared,\n\nbecause we know that there are certain types of radiation\n\nthat are linked to cancer.\n\nHere we have the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nThings on this end are very high energy,\n\nand this rainbow right here is our visible light spectrum.\n\nUltraviolet and above, these types of radiation\n\ncan potentially damage our cells in our body,\n\nand can lead to changes in our cells and mutations.\n\nBut when you get below the energy level of visible light\n\nand you get into infrared and microwaves, way down here,\n\nthose are your radio waves.\n\nSo this radio frequency radiation\n\nis one of the lowest energy types of radiation,\n\nand it's considered what we call non-ionizing,\n\nmeaning it cannot penetrate your body.\n\nSo even if those radio waves are all over our planet,\n\nbecause we have cell reception everywhere,\n\nthe amount of energy that they're exerting\n\nis not actually going to damage your body\n\nor cause you any potential harm.\n\n@JohnPetersonFW wants to know, I'd really like to know,\n\nfrom someone that actually knows\n\nif buying organic food for double the price\n\nis actually worth it/better for you.\n\nThe biggest misconception is that organic is pesticide free.\n\nHere we have organic blueberries.\n\nThey are grown using organic pesticides\n\nand organic pesticides are simply chemicals\n\nthat have not been synthetically altered\n\nfrom the original state in which they exist\n\nsomewhere in nature.\n\nIn contrast, these are conventional blueberries\n\nwho were grown using conventional pesticides.\n\nConventional pesticides are those that can be\n\nsynthetically altered in order to improve their specificity.\n\nA 2010 study in PLoS One was looking at\n\nsix different pesticides that are used to control aphids\n\non soybean plants.\n\nIt was found to not only control aphids,\n\nbut it also killed the natural predators of the aphids,\n\nthe insidious flower bug, and the Asian lady beetle,\n\nhaving a more broad negative ecological impact.\n\nAnother misconception about all produce\n\nis that they have all these residues of pesticides on them.\n\nWe're talking about parts per trillion, parts per billion.\n\nThese are minuscule levels.\n\nIf you're very concerned about it, absolutely.\n\nWash your produce in water.\n\nBut aside from that,\n\nyou don't need to be stressing about your produce.\n\n@ToyaRochelle wants to know,\n\nwhat do people think they're cleansing\n\nwhen they do juice and smoothie cleanses or detoxes?\n\nBut I hate to break it to you,\n\nif you have functioning organ systems,\n\nyou're already detoxing all day every day.\n\nSo when people say that they're doing a parasite cleanse\n\nor a cleanse and they're claiming that these stringy things\n\nin their poop is parasite parse,\n\nwhat they're actually seeing is mucus\n\nand sloughed off intestinal cells,\n\nwhich is not a good thing,\n\nit's actually harming your GI tract.\n\n@bigpapabriggs wants to know, on a scale from one to 10,\n\nhow scared should I be of Lyme disease?\n\nSo as someone who's actually studied Lyme disease\n\nfor several decades,\n\nLyme disease is actually not as easy to get as you think.\n\nNot only do you have to have the right species of tick\n\nactually bite you, but it has to feed on you\n\nfor at least 24 hours\n\nin order to have a chance to transmit the bacteria for you.\n\nYour likelihood or risk of getting Lyme disease\n\nis very, very low.\n\nScale of one to 10, I would give it about a two or a three.\n\nThere's only two species of ticks in the US\n\nthat can transmit Lyme disease.\n\nThere are some areas in the country\n\nthat you have higher risk,\n\nlike the Midwest and the Northeast,\n\nand this is because you have higher proportions of\n\nboth the ticks that live there\n\nand the bacteria in those ticks.\n\nIn other parts of the country, the risk is almost zero.\n\nThere are a lot of common myths about Lyme disease.\n\nThe first is that once you're infected,\n\nyou're always gonna be infected, and that is just not true.\n\nIt's a bacterial infection,\n\nand once you've taken antibiotics for standard course\n\nor very effective treatments,\n\nyou're going to eliminate the bacteria.\n\nBut unfortunately, since it was discovered in the 1980s,\n\nit has really been the target of a lot of misinformation.\n\nAnd that can be attributed partially to some of these tests\n\nthat are sold direct to consumer,\n\nthat claim to be able to diagnose you with Lyme disease.\n\nUnfortunately, these tests are not FDA approved,\n\nand are not accurate, but they tell people\n\nthat they have Lyme disease when in reality they do not.\n\nSo it creates the perception that Lyme disease\n\nis not only more widespread than it is,\n\nbut is much more prevalent and severe.\n\n@RetiredDent, I'm seeing more and more parents\n\ngiving their children non fluoridated toothpaste.\n\nWhat's up with that?\n\nWhy are people so afraid of fluoride?\n\nWell, fluoride is a naturally occurring substance\n\nthat can be found in minerals and soil,\n\nand in our environment.\n\nAnd it was determined many, many years ago that communities\n\nthat had naturally higher levels of fluoride in their water\n\nwe're less likely to develop cavities.\n\nSo we started fluoridating water\n\nand adding fluoride to toothpaste over 75 years ago,\n\nand that's really plummeted\n\nthe amount of dental caries or cavities.\n\nUnfortunately claims on social media\n\nthat are not based on reality,\n\ntell people that fluoride is a neurotoxin.\n\nWhat they don't mention is that the dosage\n\nat which you'd have to consume fluoride\n\nin order to have any toxic effect\n\nis well outside of the reality\n\nof anything you could possibly consume.\n\nFluoride in water is added at 0.7 milligrams per kilogram,\n\nwhich means that in order to hit the minimum threshold\n\nwhere you might have skeletal effects from fluoride,\n\nif you were a child weighing 22 pounds,\n\nyou'd have to drink 57 liters of water a day.\n\nSo it really is not a concern.\n\n@karinefrigon says,\n\neverybody should have a gluten-free diet, I'm just saying.\n\nThe reality is if you don't have a medical reason\n\nto avoid gluten, you don't need to avoid gluten.\n\nGluten is a structural protein\n\nthat's found in certain grains like wheat,\n\nbarley, rosin and others.\n\nAnd there are certain medical conditions\n\nthat you should avoid this particular protein.\n\nThis would be something like celiac disease,\n\nwhich is an autoimmune disorder.\n\nThere's been a lot of studies\n\nin whether or not avoiding gluten offers a benefit,\n\nand the big consensus is is that it doesn't.\n\nSometimes we hear claims that the gluten here is worse\n\nbecause we use all the processed chemicals\n\nand we use all the pesticides.\n\nAnd when you went to Europe,\n\nyou were able to eat all the bread you wanted\n\nand you didn't have those issues with the gluten.\n\nAnd unfortunately, the gluten quantity in wheats\n\nacross countries is essentially the same.\n\nOn top of that, we also use the same pesticides.\n\nGlyphosate is one that's often demonized\n\nbecause it's used to dry down wheat,\n\nbut it's also used in Europe.\n\nEurope imports millions of pounds of American wheat\n\nevery year to make the very breads that you're eating.\n\nI would suggest that maybe you're more relaxed\n\nwhile you're on vacation,\n\nand you're not gulping down your food\n\nin between bringing kids to activities and swallowing air,\n\nleading to the perceived feeling of bloat,\n\nwhich has nothing to do with the gluten,\n\nbut everything to do with the rushing\n\nand the stress that you have with your day-to-day life.\n\n@TealePB wants to know what makes a study,\n\nany study, reliable?\n\nSo when we talk about the scientific method,\n\nwe have what we call the hierarchy of evidence.\n\nAt the bottom, you have things that are generally based\n\non small sample sizes or opinions.\n\nFrom there, you're going into animal trials\n\nand in vitro data.\n\nSo these are your Petri dish studies, or your animal data\n\nthat are not automatically representative\n\nof what's happening in people.\n\nSay you wanna study a disease process in humans\n\nand you use an animal model\n\nthat that disease doesn't occur in,\n\nthat's not going to be an accurate\n\nor representative research model,\n\nbecause it's not going to give you data\n\nthat you can then generalize to people.\n\nOnce you get above that, you're moving into human studies.\n\nRandomized controlled trials, they're usually also blinded.\n\nThose are considered our gold standard,\n\nso with vaccine studies, this is very common.\n\nThere is a group of people that receive the placebo,\n\nwhich is usually salt water,\n\nand there are people that received the vaccine.\n\nNone of them know what they received,\n\nyou might report different symptoms than if you knew\n\nyou were getting the placebo.\n\nAt the very top, you have what we call meta-analyses\n\nand systematic reviews.\n\nThese are analyses where we take multiple studies\n\nand we pool them and analyze them together.\n\nThere are really high quality journals like JAMA,\n\nwhich is the Journal of the American Medical Association\n\nor PNAS, which is the Proceedings\n\nof the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nBut as a rule of thumb, if you're trying to find information\n\non a given topic, you wanna look for at the minimum,\n\nthat it is indeed peer reviewed,\n\nand that it is aligning with other topics\n\nor other papers that are in that field.\n\nIt is very, very unlikely that one study\n\nis going to displace the thousands of other studies\n\nwithin a given field or topic.\n\nWe call that cherry picking.\n\n@WishWellTherapy wants know,\n\nstudy after study has revealed that aspartame,\n\nsucralose, and saccharin lead to cancer\n\nand other disorders of the cells and organ.\n\nSaccharin was actually banned temporarily in the US,\n\nbecause there was thought to be a relationship\n\nbetween saccharin and bladder cancer.\n\nIt turns out that the studies they were using\n\nwere using a type of rat.\n\nThese rats had a genetic predisposition\n\nthat they developed these bladder crystals,\n\nand made them more likely to develop tumors.\n\nNot only were we using rats that were not an appropriate\n\nor realistic research model, these rats were being fed\n\nclose to 10% of their body weight per day in saccharin.\n\nAnd it was at that point that a proportion of the male rats\n\ndeveloped bladder cancers.\n\nFollow-up studies using rhesus macaques, mice,\n\nand looking at human data have demonstrated\n\nthat saccharin is not related to cancer in humans at all,\n\nand so the ban was lifted.\n\nBut ultimately that stigma related to saccharin\n\nhas actually transferred to other artificial sweeteners.\n\n@flyrodu asks, how do we know that supplements work?\n\nIs there any real research on all these supplements\n\nthat exist?\n\nE.G, athletic greens, et cetera?\n\nSo in the United States alone,\n\nthe dietary supplement industry\n\nis worth nearly $160 billion.\n\nUnlike FDA approved medications,\n\nsupplements do not have to prove that they are helping\n\nor offering a benefit.\n\nA lot of people may take powdered vitamin C\n\nand mix it into their water\n\nwhen they feel like they have a cold or a flu coming on.\n\nVitamin C supplementation doesn't reduce the duration\n\nof respiratory illnesses,\n\nit doesn't lessen the severity of them,\n\nit doesn't prevent them.\n\nThere's been a lot of studies, especially in recent years\n\nthat have been looking at\n\nthe benefits of vitamin D supplement.\n\nSo this one assessed the efficacy of vitamin D and zinc\n\nin combination to improve outcomes of Covid-19.\n\nAnd ultimately what these show is that\n\nvitamin D supplementation did not lessen disease severity,\n\ndid not reduce hospital stay,\n\ndid not reduce severity of symptoms,\n\nand did not improve mortality outcomes.\n\nAnd there was a study that actually found over 50%\n\nof immune boosting supplements\n\nwere lying about what was in the product.\n\nAnd worse, some were not\n\nmentioning things that were in them.\n\n@pennebykameron wants to know,\n\nis there scientific evidence of crystals\n\nbefore and after charging?\n\nMany people believe that crystals have energetic powers,\n\nthat the crystal, or the energy in the crystal\n\nis vibrating with your own personal energy.\n\nAnd unfortunately there have been no studies\n\nthat have suggested that this is a true relationship.\n\nIt is likely nothing more than the placebo effect.\n\nThe placebo effect can be very strong.\n\nThere is a body of data that suggests that in some instances\n\npeople can feel like they're recovering\n\nfrom things more quickly or that their symptoms\n\nor side effects are lower\n\nbecause they have that power of the placebo.\n\nSo we don't wanna discount the placebo effect,\n\nbut we certainly don't want it to replace\n\nactual science-based medicine.\n\n@Janani802 wants to know, can fasting help cancer patients?\n\nSo this claim is really pervasive,\n\nand as someone who works in cancer research\n\nis really harmful for a lot of reasons,\n\nand it kind of breaks my heart.\n\nThis claim originated from in vitro studies,\n\nor Petri dish studies where we are growing cancer cells.\n\nAnd what they found was depriving them of nutrients,\n\nor simulating fasting cause the cancer cells to die.\n\nBut what that fails to account for is that\n\nany cell deprived of nutrient is going to fail to grow.\n\nAnd what happening in a piece of plastic\n\nor a plastic dish like this,\n\nis not what is happening inside the complex being of a human\n\nwho has cancer.\n\nFasting can actually be harmful if you're battling cancer,\n\n'cause you're depriving yourself and your body\n\nof very essential nutrients and calories that you need\n\nfor your immune system to do its best work.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nAlways be skeptical when you encounter things\n\nthat may not be as they seem.\n\nThanks for

{"title": "Biomedical Scientist Answers Pseudoscience Questions From Twitter", "text": "Transcript\n\nI'm Dr. Andrea Love, biomedical scientist.\n\nI fact check false health claims.\n\nThis is Pseudoscience Support.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\n@AwayFromTheKeys wants to know,\n\nhow do you define pseudoscience?\n\nSo pseudoscience refers to beliefs or practices\n\nthat appear scientific on the surface,\n\nbut they lack the repeatability, the reliability,\n\nor the credibility of science.\n\nOften they're making claims that are based on anecdotes,\n\nas opposed to evidence.\n\nThey often start with a nugget of truth,\n\nand then widely exaggerate that\n\nbeyond what reality would indicate.\n\n@Shannyxrae wants to know,\n\nshould I buy this flat tummy tea or not?\n\nAnyone tried it?\n\nI hate to break it to you,\n\nthat these things are really just glorified laxatives.\n\nSo what's happening is that\n\nyou're speeding up your digestive process\n\nbeyond what it should be normally.\n\nBut what you're flushing out is\n\nfood that you haven't finished digesting properly\n\nand absorbing their nutrients.\n\nSo you're creating a lot of diarrhea,\n\nand you're also dehydrating yourself.\n\nSo while you might feel like you have a very flat tummy,\n\nit's not because you're actually losing weight\n\nor removing toxins, it's simply because you've removed food\n\nto quickly from your body, and you're dehydrating yourself.\n\n@itssynecdoche is asking, why am I only just learning\n\nthat chiropractors are not real doctors?\n\nYeah.\n\nSo chiropractic is a $15 billion industry,\n\nand it was invented by a guy named Didi Palmer\n\nwho thought that ghosts were telling him to create it.\n\nThey believe that the joints and the nerves\n\nthat go through our body are the cause of every ailment\n\nthat we know of.\n\nUnfortunately, chiropractic is a full-on pseudoscience.\n\nThere are certain chiropractors\n\nthat maybe stay in the lane of more physical therapy,\n\nand there's a little bit of data to suggest that\n\nfor certain types of low back pain,\n\nchiropractic adjustment can offer temporary relief,\n\nbut it's not fixing a musculoskeletal problem,\n\nand it's definitely not doing\n\nthe other things that chiropractors claim to do.\n\nSo if you see the abbreviation DC\n\nafter someone's name on social media,\n\nthat means that they're a chiropractor,\n\nand they're not a medical or scientific expert.\n\n@pathogenflock, is it just me,\n\nor is belief in pseudoscience rising recently?\n\nThis is absolutely correct.\n\nWe have seen a dramatic rise in anti-science\n\nand pseudoscience beliefs,\n\nand this does trend with the prevalence of social media.\n\nAlso coincides with the recent Covid-19 pandemic\n\nand the increasing amount of politicization of vaccines.\n\nSo this past year,\n\nonly 93.1% of entering school age children\n\nreceived vaccinations for the MMR,\n\nthe measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.\n\nThis is a 2% drop compared to the previous school year,\n\nparticularly for a disease where you need\n\nat least 95% coverage to stop the spread of measles,\n\nthis is a very concerning trend.\n\n@gutznotguts wants to know\n\nhow the [bleep] did the vaccines cause autism myth\n\neven start?\n\nThis myth started in 1998\n\nbecause of a British gastroenterologist\n\nnamed Andrew Wakefield,\n\nwho has since lost his medical license\n\nand the ability to practice medicine.\n\nBut he published a paper in The Lancet,\n\nwhich is a very prestigious medical journal,\n\nand claimed that he had data to demonstrate\n\na link between the MMR vaccine,\n\nwhich is the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine\n\nand autism symptoms in children.\n\nThe problem was he falsified all of the data in that paper.\n\nMore than that, he used self-reports from parents\n\nwho were planning to sue the existing manufacturers\n\nof the MMR vaccine.\n\nOn top of that, he was trying to sell\n\nand market his own MMR vaccine,\n\nbut because it was published\n\nin such prestigious medical journal,\n\nit took the world by storm, it caused a lot of fear.\n\nEventually that paper was retracted,\n\nbut that retraction did not occur until 2010,\n\n12 years later.\n\nNow, in recent years, we're seeing measles rates\n\nabove what we have ever seen in the US,\n\nand it is really a cause for concern\n\nbecause the very first measles vaccine\n\nwas put on the market in 1963.\n\nSo we have over 60 years of data\n\nthat demonstrate that there is no relationship\n\nbetween vaccines and autism.\n\n@briney4trump, GMOs change our DNA every day\n\nand give people several diseases.\n\nWhy did we approve of this?\n\nThis is not true.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the papaya was being wiped out\n\nby a virus called the papaya ring spot virus.\n\nSo we created a GMO papaya\n\nthat can resist the papaya ring spot virus.\n\n90% of the papayas are GMO.\n\nAnd when you eat them, it is not changing your DNA.\n\nSo when you eat the papaya, you're eating all of its cells\n\nand all of those cells contain DNA.\n\nSo those DNA molecules are going to enter your stomach\n\nand it's gonna mix with an enzyme called pepsin.\n\nSo when the pepsin interacts with the DNA molecule,\n\nit blasted apart into all of these individual subunits,\n\nand therefore the DNA is no longer intact.\n\nIt's not gonna change your DNA,\n\nit's not gonna cause any harmful consequences.\n\n@JohnnyV45385760 wants to know,\n\nhow can you tell if a health influencer is legit\n\nor full of shit?\n\nSome of the red flags to look for are, number one,\n\nthey are trying to evoke very strong negative emotions.\n\nThings like fear, anxiety, or worry,\n\nparticularly as it relates to your health\n\nor the health of your children or your family.\n\nNumber two, they're making all or none statements.\n\nThey're saying that this thing is causing cancer,\n\nor this thing is going to fix some disorder.\n\nNumber three, if they're selling you something\n\nthat is related to the claims that they're making,\n\nwhether that is a supplement, or a diet plan,\n\nor a protocol, or a book.\n\nNumber four, if they have an obvious conflict of interest.\n\nAre they working for the company\n\nof the product that they're selling you?\n\nAnd last but not least, if they're speaking way outside\n\nof their area of expertise.\n\nIf someone is a neuroscientist\n\nthat specializes in optic nerve signaling,\n\nand they're pretending to be an expert\n\nin infectious disease immunology,\n\nthat's probably a red flag.\n\n@10000problems wants to know\n\nwhy does homeopathic medicine work\n\nso much better than real medicine?\n\nUnfortunately that is not the case.\n\nBut let me tell you a little bit about what homeopathy is,\n\n'cause it's often confused with\n\nother sorts of alternative remedies.\n\nHomeopathy is a pseudoscience that was created\n\nor invented in the 1700s by a German guy\n\nnamed Samuel Hahnemann.\n\nHe created this based on two beliefs.\n\nThe first is that like cures like,\n\nmeaning that if something causes a symptom,\n\nthat same substance can cure\n\nan ailment that creates that symptom.\n\nOnion causes watery eyes when you cut it.\n\nTherefore, homeopathic onion\n\nis going to cure things like allergies\n\nthat also cause watery eyes.\n\nBut that goes along with the second belief,\n\nor the law of infinite decimals.\n\nMeaning that the remedy becomes more potent\n\nthe more it is diluted.\n\nIf you find a label on a homeopathic remedy\n\nthat says 12C, C means 100, and 12 means that you've diluted\n\nthe substance 12 times a hundred fold over,\n\nwhich means you have one part in this many parts,\n\nwhich is also called one septillion.\n\nSo what that means is that\n\nthere's no actual active ingredient in that.\n\nThat is probably a good thing\n\nbecause there are many homeopathic remedies\n\nthat can be very dangerous\n\nif you would ingest them at normal dosage.\n\nFor example, teething tablets\n\nthat claim to have homeopathic belladonna,\n\nwhich is deadly nightshade,\n\nwere contaminated with measurable levels of belladonna,\n\nand hundreds of babies developed seizures,\n\nand at least 10 babies died.\n\nThis happened starting in 2010 and 2012,\n\nand there were several brands that were to blame.\n\nOne final danger of homeopathy is that\n\nmany people believe that they're taking something\n\nthat's beneficial, and beyond the fact that it is\n\nnothing more than a sugar pill,\n\nit often leads people to forego actual medical care,\n\nwhich is one of the biggest harms of all.\n\n@paul_metta555 asks,\n\nare cell phone towers detrimental to our health?\n\nWhy so many?\n\nWhy do they emit high pitch noises?\n\nAre they carcinogenic?\n\nWhy the spiking cancer rates since they arrived?\n\nCell phone towers look like this.\n\nYou have this primary node that's coming out from all sides,\n\nand you have these radio waves that are being emitted.\n\nYou also have these secondary nodes\n\nthat are a little bit smaller,\n\nbut all of these radio frequency waves\n\nare projected in every direction,\n\nbecause otherwise we wouldn't have cell reception.\n\nSo this myth kind of started because people heard the word\n\nradiofrequency radiation and got scared,\n\nbecause we know that there are certain types of radiation\n\nthat are linked to cancer.\n\nHere we have the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nThings on this end are very high energy,\n\nand this rainbow right here is our visible light spectrum.\n\nUltraviolet and above, these types of radiation\n\ncan potentially damage our cells in our body,\n\nand can lead to changes in our cells and mutations.\n\nBut when you get below the energy level of visible light\n\nand you get into infrared and microwaves, way down here,\n\nthose are your radio waves.\n\nSo this radio frequency radiation\n\nis one of the lowest energy types of radiation,\n\nand it's considered what we call non-ionizing,\n\nmeaning it cannot penetrate your body.\n\nSo even if those radio waves are all over our planet,\n\nbecause we have cell reception everywhere,\n\nthe amount of energy that they're exerting\n\nis not actually going to damage your body\n\nor cause you any potential harm.\n\n@JohnPetersonFW wants to know, I'd really like to know,\n\nfrom someone that actually knows\n\nif buying organic food for double the price\n\nis actually worth it/better for you.\n\nThe biggest misconception is that organic is pesticide free.\n\nHere we have organic blueberries.\n\nThey are grown using organic pesticides\n\nand organic pesticides are simply chemicals\n\nthat have not been synthetically altered\n\nfrom the original state in which they exist\n\nsomewhere in nature.\n\nIn contrast, these are conventional blueberries\n\nwho were grown using conventional pesticides.\n\nConventional pesticides are those that can be\n\nsynthetically altered in order to improve their specificity.\n\nA 2010 study in PLoS One was looking at\n\nsix different pesticides that are used to control aphids\n\non soybean plants.\n\nIt was found to not only control aphids,\n\nbut it also killed the natural predators of the aphids,\n\nthe insidious flower bug, and the Asian lady beetle,\n\nhaving a more broad negative ecological impact.\n\nAnother misconception about all produce\n\nis that they have all these residues of pesticides on them.\n\nWe're talking about parts per trillion, parts per billion.\n\nThese are minuscule levels.\n\nIf you're very concerned about it, absolutely.\n\nWash your produce in water.\n\nBut aside from that,\n\nyou don't need to be stressing about your produce.\n\n@ToyaRochelle wants to know,\n\nwhat do people think they're cleansing\n\nwhen they do juice and smoothie cleanses or detoxes?\n\nBut I hate to break it to you,\n\nif you have functioning organ systems,\n\nyou're already detoxing all day every day.\n\nSo when people say that they're doing a parasite cleanse\n\nor a cleanse and they're claiming that these stringy things\n\nin their poop is parasite parse,\n\nwhat they're actually seeing is mucus\n\nand sloughed off intestinal cells,\n\nwhich is not a good thing,\n\nit's actually harming your GI tract.\n\n@bigpapabriggs wants to know, on a scale from one to 10,\n\nhow scared should I be of Lyme disease?\n\nSo as someone who's actually studied Lyme disease\n\nfor several decades,\n\nLyme disease is actually not as easy to get as you think.\n\nNot only do you have to have the right species of tick\n\nactually bite you, but it has to feed on you\n\nfor at least 24 hours\n\nin order to have a chance to transmit the bacteria for you.\n\nYour likelihood or risk of getting Lyme disease\n\nis very, very low.\n\nScale of one to 10, I would give it about a two or a three.\n\nThere's only two species of ticks in the US\n\nthat can transmit Lyme disease.\n\nThere are some areas in the country\n\nthat you have higher risk,\n\nlike the Midwest and the Northeast,\n\nand this is because you have higher proportions of\n\nboth the ticks that live there\n\nand the bacteria in those

and that is just not true.\n\nIt's a bacterial infection,\n\nand once you've taken antibiotics for standard course\n\nor very effective treatments,\n\nyou're going to eliminate the bacteria.\n\nBut unfortunately, since it was discovered in the 1980s,\n\nit has really been the target of a lot of misinformation.\n\nAnd that can be attributed partially to some of these tests\n\nthat are sold direct to consumer,\n\nthat claim to be able to diagnose you with Lyme disease.\n\nUnfortunately, these tests are not FDA approved,\n\nand are not accurate, but they tell people\n\nthat they have Lyme disease when in reality they do not.\n\nSo it creates the perception that Lyme disease\n\nis not only more widespread than it is,\n\nbut is much more prevalent and severe.\n\n@RetiredDent, I'm seeing more and more parents\n\ngiving their children non fluoridated toothpaste.\n\nWhat's up with that?\n\nWhy are people so afraid of fluoride?\n\nWell, fluoride is a naturally occurring substance\n\nthat

wheats\n\nacross countries is essentially the same.\n\nOn top of that, we also use the same pesticides.\n\nGlyphosate is one that's often demonized\n\nbecause it's used to dry down wheat,\n\nbut it's also used in Europe.\n\nEurope imports millions of pounds of American wheat\n\nevery year to make the very breads that you're eating.\n\nI would suggest that maybe you're more relaxed\n\nwhile you're on vacation,\n\nand you're not gulping down your food\n\nin between bringing kids to activities and swallowing air,\n\nleading to the perceived feeling of bloat,\n\nwhich has nothing to do with the gluten,\n\nbut everything to do with the rushing\n\nand the stress that you have with your day-to-day life.\n\n@TealePB wants to know what makes a study,\n\nany study, reliable?\n\nSo when we talk about the scientific method,\n\nwe have what we call the hierarchy of evidence.\n\nAt the bottom, you have things that are generally based\n\non small sample sizes or opinions.\n\nFrom there, you're going into animal trials\n\nand in vitro data.\n\nSo these are your Petri dish studies, or your animal data\n\nthat are not automatically representative\n\nof what's happening in people.\n\nSay you wanna study a disease process in humans\n\nand you use an animal model\n\nthat that disease doesn't occur in,\n\nthat's not going to be an accurate\n\nor representative research model,\n\nbecause it's not going to give you data\n\nthat you can then generalize to people.\n\nOnce you get above that, you're moving into human studies.\n\nRandomized controlled trials, they're usually also blinded.\n\nThose are considered our gold standard,\n\nso with vaccine studies, this is very common.\n\nThere is a group of people that receive the placebo,\n\nwhich is usually salt water,\n\nand there are people that received the vaccine.\n\nNone of them know what they received,\n\nyou might report different symptoms than if you knew\n\nyou were getting the placebo.\n\nAt the very top, you have what we call meta-analyses\n\nand systematic reviews.\n\nThese are analyses where we take multiple studies\n\nand we pool them and analyze them together.\n\nThere are really high quality journals like JAMA,\n\nwhich is the Journal of the American Medical Association\n\nor PNAS, which is the Proceedings\n\nof the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nBut as a rule of thumb, if you're trying to find information\n\non a given topic, you wanna look for at the minimum,\n\nthat it is indeed peer reviewed,\n\nand that it is aligning with other topics\n\nor other papers that are in that field.\n\nIt is very, very unlikely that one study\n\nis going to displace the thousands of other studies\n\nwithin a given field or topic.\n\nWe call that cherry picking.\n\n@WishWellTherapy wants know,\n\nstudy after study has revealed that aspartame,\n\nsucralose, and saccharin lead to cancer\n\nand other disorders of the cells and organ.\n\nSaccharin was actually banned temporarily in the US,\n\nbecause there was thought to be a relationship\n\nbetween saccharin and bladder cancer.\n\nIt turns out that the studies they were using\n\nwere using a type of rat.\n\nThese rats had a genetic predisposition\n\nthat they developed these bladder crystals,\n\nand made them more likely to develop tumors.\n\nNot only were we using rats that were not an appropriate\n\nor realistic research model, these rats were being fed\n\nclose to 10% of their body weight per day in saccharin.\n\nAnd it was at that point that a proportion of the male rats\n\ndeveloped bladder cancers.\n\nFollow-up studies using rhesus macaques, mice,\n\nand looking at human data have demonstrated\n\nthat saccharin is not related to cancer in humans at all,\n\nand so the ban was lifted.\n\nBut ultimately that stigma related to saccharin\n\nhas actually transferred to other artificial sweeteners.\n\n@flyrodu asks, how do we know that supplements work?\n\nIs there any real research on all these supplements\n\nthat exist?\n\nE.G, athletic greens, et cetera?\n\nSo in the United States alone,\n\nthe dietary supplement industry\n\nis worth nearly $160 billion.\n\nUnlike FDA approved medications,\n\nsupplements do not have to prove that they are helping\n\nor offering a benefit.\n\nA lot of people may take powdered vitamin C\n\nand mix it into their water\n\nwhen they feel like they have a cold or a flu coming on.\n\nVitamin C supplementation doesn't reduce the duration\n\nof respiratory illnesses,\n\nit doesn't lessen the severity of them,\n\nit doesn't prevent them.\n\nThere's been a lot of studies, especially in recent years\n\nthat have been looking at\n\nthe benefits of vitamin D supplement.\n\nSo this one assessed the efficacy of vitamin D and zinc\n\nin combination to improve outcomes of Covid-19.\n\nAnd ultimately what these show is that\n\nvitamin D supplementation did not lessen disease severity,\n\ndid not reduce hospital stay,\n\ndid not reduce severity of symptoms,\n\nand did not improve mortality outcomes.\n\nAnd there was a study that actually found over 50%\n\nof immune boosting supplements\n\nwere lying about what was in the product.\n\nAnd worse, some were not\n\nmentioning things that were in them.\n\n@pennebykameron wants to know,\n\nis there scientific evidence of crystals\n\nbefore and after charging?\n\nMany people believe that crystals have energetic powers,\n\nthat the crystal, or the energy in the crystal\n\nis vibrating with your own personal energy.\n\nAnd unfortunately there have been no studies\n\nthat have suggested that this is a true relationship.\n\nIt is likely nothing more than the placebo effect.\n\nThe placebo effect can be very strong.\n\nThere is a body of data that suggests that in some instances\n\npeople can feel like they're recovering\n\nfrom things more quickly or that their symptoms\n\nor side effects are lower\n\nbecause they have that power of the placebo.\n\nSo we don't wanna discount the placebo effect,\n\nbut we certainly don't want it to replace\n\nactual science-based medicine.\n\n@Janani802 wants to know, can fasting help cancer patients?\n\nSo this claim is really pervasive,\n\nand as someone who works in cancer research\n\nis really harmful for a lot of reasons,\n\nand it kind of breaks my heart.\n\nThis claim originated from in vitro studies,\n\nor Petri dish studies where we are growing cancer cells.\n\nAnd what they found was depriving them of nutrients,\n\nor simulating fasting cause the cancer cells to die.\n\nBut what that fails to account for is that\n\nany cell deprived of nutrient is going to fail to grow.\n\nAnd what happening in a piece of plastic\n\nor a plastic dish like this,\n\nis not what is happening inside the complex being of a human\n\nwho has cancer.\n\nFasting can actually be harmful if you're battling cancer,\n\n'cause you're depriving yourself and your body\n\nof very essential nutrients and calories that you need\n\nfor your immune system to do its best work.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nAlways be skeptical when you encounter things\n\nthat may not be as they seem.\n\nThanks for

Yeah!\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI just did Transformers. I did Optimus Prime.\n\nNo, you, what? Mm-hm.\n\nThat's sick! Bring me Shia LaBeouf!\n\nOkay. [laughing] Where's Megan Fox?\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nHello. How was Anya Taylor-Joy discovered?\n\nI was walking my dog, and a car started chasing me,\n\nand I picked up my dog- What?\n\nStraight up.\n\nSo, like, at the time,\n\nmy parents had been watching a lot of 24.\n\nAnd so, in my head,\n\nwhen I was, like, walking down the street with my dog,\n\nI was like, Ah, maybe that car's chasing me,\n\nbut maybe it's not.\n\nAnd then I picked up pace, and the car did start chasing me.\n\nAnd then this guy stuck his head out the window and said,\n\nIf you stop, you won't regret it.\n\nAnd I stopped. Wow.\n\nAnd it was a modeling agency.\n\nBut, at the end of that conversation, they were like,\n\nNever do that again. Yeah, wow.\n\nDon't know what the moral of the story is here.\n\nLike, definitely don't stop,\n\nYeah. but, worked out for me.\n\nDo, but don't.\n\nHow good, oh no, how good-\n\nChris, you're too aggressive with it!\n\nDid someone use some super glue?\n\nYou know, how goodle? How good\n\nis Anya Taylor-Joy at chess?\n\nSo, I was quite good, when we were filming.\n\nAnd then, you know that short-term memory part of your brain\n\nwhere you store all the stuff\n\nYeah. that you're supposed to do\n\nfor film and TV?\n\nI had to fill it with other things.\n\nSo, I filled it with Cranky Black,\n\nand this, and that, and whatever.\n\nBut I do wanna get back into it.\n\nWe should have a chess game\n\nsome time. We should.\n\nNow, I'm not, I used to play chess as a kid,\n\nbut, Really?\n\nnot so much anymore. Ah.\n\nHow does Anya Taylor-Joy cry on cue? Can you cry on cue?\n\nI can cry on cue. Wow.\n\nI also had a nosebleed on cue once,\n\nwhich was really crazy. On purpose?\n\nIt was supposed to happen in the scene,\n\nand then, when it was supposed to happen in the scene,\n\nI had a nosebleed.\n\nReally? Yeah, for real.\n\nWow. It was really crazy.\n\nI once had somebody tell me\n\nthat the best way to remember lines was to have\n\nthe right thoughts. Mm-hm.\n\nAnd if you're having the right thoughts,\n\nthen the right thing to say would naturally come.\n\nAnd so, I feel like when you're crying like that,\n\nit just, naturally, the emotion takes you there.\n\nSo, is it, you have to think of something sad,\n\nor is it, like, physical, No.\n\nsqueeze the tears out.\n\nIt cannot be about my own life.\n\nI made that mistake on my first movie.\n\nI spent the whole day, like, prepping\n\nfor this really emotional scene,\n\nand I just thought of, like, terrible things\n\nfor seven hours straight,\n\nwhich is really- And not on camera.\n\nNot on camera. Yeah.\n\nSo, by the time that the scene came 'round,\n\nI was like, I got nothing.\n\nSo, yeah, it has to be\n\nfor the point-of-view of the character.\n\nBut how 'bout you? I'm curious.\n\nYes, I feel like,\n\nso many years of trying to manipulate emotions\n\nthat my body's like, Nah.\n\nYeah, no, yeah. And calls BS\n\nevery time I try and do it.\n\nSo, I hope the script gets me there,\n\nand I hope it organically happens.\n\nBut I also, more concentrate on whatever the emotion is,\n\nand whatever I'm trying to say or do in the scene,\n\nrather than actually cry.\n\nHow does Anya Taylor-Joy know Spanish?\n\nIt is my first language.\n\nSo, most of my family lives in Argentina.\n\nMy mom is half English, half Spanish, born in Africa.\n\nI learned to speak English when I was eight years old.\n\nIt's one of the main questions for me.\n\nHow come Chris Hemsworth is so good at Spanish?\n\n[Anya giggling]\n\nAlso just comes naturally.\n\nAll right, yeah, flip it. Ah!\n\nOh, it's my turn.\n\nYeah, it's your turn. All right.\n\n[Anya] Is Chris Hemsworth\n\nThe villain. the villain in Furiosa?\n\nNo. Just kidding. [chuckles]\n\nWell, I mean, to be- Not in his own eyes.\n\nYeah. You know.\n\nI mean, I think he sort of justifies his actions\n\nthrough the lens of, and his version of how things are,\n\nand he believes he's doing what is appropriate\n\nand needed for his survival, for himself,\n\nbut also for Furiosa,\n\nand the people, the biker horde that he's responsible for.\n\nBut yeah, he's not a nice guy. [chuckles]\n\nWho is Chris Hemsworth,\n\nI'm gonna say, is it, like, related to?\n\nWho is Chris Hemsworth best friend?\n\nBesides you, [Anya giggles]\n\nI've got two guys I work with,\n\nthat I've known since I was six and seven, Zaki and Aza,\n\nYeah. who I think you would've met\n\non the movie. Yeah.\n\nI was gonna say your kids.\n\nYou're a really great dad. My kids.\n\nLet's do that one again, in case they're watching.\n\nOh, my kids, of course.\n\nYour kids. [laughs] And my wife, and my wife.\n\nMy kids and my wife, Yeah, Chris.\n\n[laughing] have always been my best friends.\n\nWhen was Chris Hemsworth, okay,\n\nOn dances. on Dancing with the Stars?\n\nYeah. You're joking.\n\nDon't be surprised. It's, you've seen it.\n\nWhich, no, I haven't.\n\nI swear to God. She used to watch it\n\nevery day on set,\n\nbefore a scene, Which country?\n\nAre there multiple countries? just to totally lose\n\nrespect for me. Wait, wait, wait,\n\nwait, wait, wait. The Australian version.\n\nThere's only seven contestants,\n\never. Can I watch this?\n\nThere's only 10 people in the country.\n\nIs that okay?\n\nYou can watch it, yeah. Can I watch it?\n\nEveryone else can. What was your favorite\n\nkind of dance?\n\n'Cause there's, like, different casts.\n\nI've not seen it, but- The samba.\n\nSamba, okay, cool. Yeah.\n\nAnd then the waltz.\n\nI was really bad, but,\n\nI'm really excited. it gave me [chuckles]\n\nmy finances to come to America.\n\nIt looks really scary, to be honest with you.\n\nLike, I can imagine it's quite, like, stressful\n\nto go and perform in front\n\nof a bunch of people. Oh, it was terrifying.\n\nYeah. It's also terrifying\n\nfor you to watch, probably.\n\nIt's like a cockroach. I won't tell you\n\nwhen I watch it. You won't be able\n\nto look away.\n\nYou'll just be like, No, no, no.\n\nYou'll show up, and I'll have a knowing look in my eye,\n\nand be like, Hi, Chris.\n\n[Interviewer] How far did you go on the show?\n\nOh, fifth, I think. [chuckles]\n\nThat's good! Everyone remembers\n\nfifth place.\n\nThat's good. That was where\n\nI wanted to get. Yeah.\n\nI didn't wanna get any higher.\n\nI believe it.\n\nJust, I didn't want to upset anyone else.\n\nYeah. I felt\n\nfor the other contestants.\n\nSo, it got to five, and I was like, I'm gonna intentionally\n\nscrew this up. Yeah.\n\nWho is Chris Hemsworth related to? I knew it would come up.\n\nA lot of people.\n\nI have two brothers, Luke and Liam.\n\nYour parents. My parents,\n\nthe only, who came.\n\nMy kids. Your children.\n\nYep, my kids.\n\nI've got cousins and grandparents, and,\n\nthis is a really wild question, this one.\n\nBack to the dancing questions. Back to the dancing.\n\nOkay, and so, au revoir. [card clatters]\n\nDoes Anya Taylor joy? Yes.\n\nDo you joy? Oh, God, I don't know.\n\n[Chris] Do you joy?\n\n[Both] Sing in Last Night in Soho?\n\nYeah, I did. I love that film.\n\nYeah, it was really fun.\n\nI got to sing it acapella in the movie,\n\nbeautiful song called, Downtown.\n\nAnd then, Edgar had the mad idea to just, like, bring me in\n\nand have me record a bunch of stuff,\n\nand it was so much fun.\n\n[Chris] Anya Taylor-Joy imperator Furiosa.\n\nWhat's the question? Yeah,\n\nthat's not really a question, is it?\n\nWhat's? You explain.\n\nI will be playing her, in a film that we are both in,\n\ncoming out May 23rd, or May 24th,\n\ndepending on where you are.\n\nThat's right. So, yeah.\n\n[Chris] Anya Taylor-Joy Super Mario.\n\nI'm also in that one, yeah.\n\nI'm Princess Peach. Yes.\n\nIt was so much fun.\n\nI actually, I got to go to Universal Studios the other day,\n\nand bring a bunch of my friends and family,\n\nYeah. and that was really,\n\nreally fun.\n\nDo you like doing the animation?\n\nI do. It's hard work. Yeah.\n\nLike, I was really surprised.\n\nI think the first time I ever did animation,\n\nI threw up after the session,\n\n'cause I'd just been screaming,\n\nOh, wow. for, like, seven hours.\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy Jack Black. Jack Black, I love him.\n\nI very rarely get starstruck, and he was just huge for me,\n\n'cause I loved Tenacious D\n\nas a kid. Yeah.\n\nAnd so, like, I immediately\n\njust scream-sang tribute at him,\n\nand he was very cool about it.\n\nI can't imagine someone coming up to me\n\nand just singing at me.\n\nAnd so, I think he was a really good sport about it.\n\nHe's awesome. Like him a lot.\n\nGood. Thank you.\n\nAre Chris Hemsworth eyes really that blue?\n\nYeah. Yeah, they are. [laughs]\n\nWhere is Limitless Chris Hemsworth filmed?\n\nMostly in Australia, some in America, and then Norway.\n\nI really wanna go to Norway. Yeah.\n\nBeautiful. I really want to go there.\n\nWhy is Chris Hemsworth\n\nnot playing Thor anymore? Not playing Thor anymore.\n\n'Cause I'm playing Dementus, in Furiosa.\n\nProfessional, right there.\n\nI've played Thor, what, eight times now, I think.\n\nLoved every second of it,\n\nand, at the moment, enjoying doing other things,\n\nand who knows what the future holds.\n\n[Anya] Is Chris Hemsworth\n\nGonna play Hulk Hogan. going to play Hulk Hogan?\n\nI'm fascinated. So, Todd Phillips and I\n\nwere talking about this.\n\nHe was gonna direct it.\n\nI don't know where that's at, to be honest. I don't know.\n\nThat's not in the immediate future,\n\nOkay. but it was a discussion,\n\nfor a little while.\n\nBut, hey brother.\n\n[chuckles] No. Yeah!\n\nAll right, let's go.\n\nThat's the same as Optimus Prime, isn't it?\n\nHey, here we go.\n\nFinal card. All right, Anya Taylor-Joy,\n\nwho is Anya Taylor-Joy in Peaky Blinders?\n\nIn Peaky Blinders, I am a real piece of work,\n\nnamed Gina Gray, and I get very weirdly embarrassed\n\nwhen people tell me that they really like me\n\nin Peaky Blinders, because she's awful.\n\nI struggle watching me as Gina.\n\nSo, when people are like, Oh, you're great in that show,\n\nI'm like, Oh, God, you've seen me\n\nbe terrible to people. No, it was cool, though.\n\nThat show is awesome. Thanks.\n\nIt was. It was really, really fun.\n\nYeah, here we go.\n\nWhat languages does Anya Taylor-Joy\n\nSpeak? Speak. speak in The Northman?\n\nGosh, you're testing my memory here.\n\nWe created a form of old Slavic,\n\nOh, wow. for me to be able\n\nto do spells and incantations in.\n\nAnd it was really fun, but also pretty crazy,\n\nbecause you would show up to set,\n\nand just be, like, screaming spells, in a made-up language.\n\nBut I remember Ralph Ineson, who did The Witch, with me,\n\nhe was also on the boat,\n\nwhere I was, like, doing my big one.\n\nAnd I remember his eyes going like,\n\nOh, shit, get out the way, and I was like, Yes!\n\n[chuckling] Yeah, cool.\n\nI scared the big Yorkshire man.\n\nYeah, you guys have a good nod\n\nto the, [clears throat] the Nordic realm.\n\nI chose to just do an Australian accent,\n\n[Anya laughs]\n\nwith a bit of an English twang to it,\n\n'cause, you know, Works great.\n\nthey speak English\n\nin the clouds, don't they? Yeah.\n\n[chuckles] Is Anya Taylor-Joy, dun-dun,\n\noh, come off it. Dude.\n\nThis is not your game. I'm doing it this way.\n\nSee, see, see?\n\nIn Dune Two. In Dune Two.\n\nI am. I am in Dune Two.\n\nAnd it was absolutely amazing.\n\nIt was, like, probably\n\none of the coolest shooting experiences I've ever had.\n\nReally? Awesome. Yeah.\n\nIt was a skeleton crew.\n\nDenis and I, in the dunes in Namibia, and it was awesome.\n\nI loved it. Epic.\n\nThanks, love. Okay.\n\nWhat is Chris Hemsworth max bench?\n\nLike, bench press. Oh, max bench.\n\nGot it. Not very good, to be honest.\n\nAs in, it's okay,\n\nbut I don't- I don't buy it.\n\nNo, because I don't do a lot of accumulation of movement.\n\nJust time under tension, you know? A lot of pushups.\n\n30, 40kg dumbbells, so, 80. Kinda my body weight, I guess.\n\n[Anya] What is Chris Hemsworth's favorite song?\n\nAh. What's your favorite song,\n\nbabe? Hm,\n\nI would just go favorite album.\n\nHow 'bout Van Morrison, Poetic Champions\n\nCompose? Nice.\n\nYep. Or Jeff Buckley, Live at Sin-e.\n\nWow! Mm.\n\nWhat? The Teskey Brothers,\n\nCrying Shame? Very impressive.\n\nThe Teskey Brothers, yeah.\n\nNice. What's your favorite album?\n\nI can't ever\n\nanswer that question. No, see.\n\nIt's like when someone says favorite film,\n\nI just get very deer-in-the-headlights,\n\nand go, Uh, uh, uh,\n\nand, like, rattle off something with animals in it.\n\nWhat tattoos does Chris Hemsworth have?\n\nI've got a Doctor Seuss tattoo up here.\n\nMy daughter, I used to read this book to her,\n\nOh, the Places You'll Go.\n\nI love that book. And then I got the tattoo,\n\nand then, I kinda got sick of the tattoo years later,\n\nand I started getting it removed.\n\nAnd then she's like, Dad, what are you doing?\n\nWhere's he going?\n\nAnd I was like, Oh, I was gonna get it rubbed off.\n\nAnd she said, No, leave it. So it stayed there.\n\nThese, my daughter drew.\n\nI was actually up with a friend one night.\n\nShe woke up, it's like 11 o'clock,\n\nshe's said, Dad, Dad, I can't sleep.\n\nSat on my lap, and started drawing some things,\n\nand these were the things she drew.\n\nThat's beautiful.\n\nAnd someone else who was sitting there was like,\n\nOh, do you know that's the Wheel of Dharma?\n\nThat's the, in Hindu, it meant many things\n\nin different spaces, but the male and female union.\n\nInitials of my family, and that's it.\n\nVery nice. Okay, last one.\n\nWhat age did Chris Hemsworth start acting?\n\nI think my first job, I would've been 18,\n\nwhen I was in high school. Yeah, same.\n\nI was, I did drama class,\n\nI got kicked outta drama class a lot.\n\nWhy? What'd you do?\n\nI just, you know, couldn't sit still,\n\nYeah. and, I just wanted to play.\n\nI wanted to have fun.\n\nAnyway, and then, when I finished school,\n\nI started, I did an acting course,\n\nand started auditioning, and got my first job.\n\nI played King Arthur. I was basically an extra.\n\nHad this, like, red wig.\n\nAnd I didn't have any dialogue,\n\nbut I was King Arthur. But you wore a crown.\n\nI wore a crown. Yeah.\n\nAnd a long wig. Sick.\n\nAll right. I think that's us done.\n\n[card clatters] Whoo-hoo!\n\nI have Googled myself, but it is never a good idea.\n\nI sort of operate with, Someone will tell me,\n\nYeah. if I need to know.\n\nAnd then you try not to read the reviews and things,\n\nand someone goes. [winces]\n\nIt's often my dad, too.\n\nI'm like, Dad, just don't, I don't wanna know.\n\nI don't have to see.\n\nOh, could you believe what they said?\n\nI'm like. Yeah, but that's dads, yeah.\n\nSo, if you're watching, Dad, stop it.\n\n[upbeat music]", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image": "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill,d_placeholder_wired.png,fl_progressive,g_face,h_1080,q_80,w_1920/v1716398615/wired_wi-autocomplete-anya-taylor-joy-and-chris-hemsworth.jpg", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

On purpose?\n\nIt was supposed to happen in the scene,\n\nand then, when it was supposed to happen in the scene,\n\nI had a nosebleed.\n\nReally? Yeah, for real.\n\nWow. It was really crazy.\n\nI once had somebody tell me\n\nthat the best way to remember lines was to have\n\nthe right thoughts. Mm-hm.\n\nAnd if you're having the right thoughts,\n\nthen the right thing to say would naturally come.\n\nAnd so, I feel like when you're crying like that,\n\nit just, naturally, the emotion takes you there.\n\nSo, is it, you have to think of something sad,\n\nor is it, like, physical, No.\n\nsqueeze the tears out.\n\nIt cannot be about my own life.\n\nI made that mistake on my first movie.\n\nI spent the whole day, like, prepping\n\nfor this really emotional scene,\n\nand I just thought of, like, terrible things\n\nfor seven hours straight,\n\nwhich is really- And not on camera.\n\nNot on camera. Yeah.\n\nSo, by the time that the scene came 'round,\n\nI was like, I got nothing.\n\nSo, yeah, it has to be\n\nfor the point-of-view of the character.\n\nBut how 'bout you? I'm curious.\n\nYes, I feel like,\n\nso many years of trying to manipulate emotions\n\nthat my body's like, Nah.\n\nYeah, no, yeah. And calls BS\n\nevery time I try and do it.\n\nSo, I hope the script gets me there,\n\nand I hope it organically happens.\n\nBut I also, more concentrate on whatever the emotion is,\n\nand whatever I'm trying to say or do in the scene,\n\nrather than actually cry.\n\nHow does Anya Taylor-Joy know Spanish?\n\nIt is my first language.\n\nSo, most of my family lives in Argentina.\n\nMy mom is half English, half Spanish, born in Africa.\n\nI learned to speak English when I was eight years old.\n\nIt's one of the main questions for me.\n\nHow come Chris Hemsworth is so good at Spanish?\n\n[Anya giggling]\n\nAlso just comes naturally.\n\nAll right, yeah, flip it. Ah!\n\nOh, it's my turn.\n\nYeah, it's your turn. All right.\n\n[Anya] Is Chris Hemsworth\n\nThe villain. the villain in Furiosa?\n\nNo. Just kidding. [chuckles]\n\nWell, I mean, to be- Not in his own eyes.\n\nYeah. You know.\n\nI mean, I think he sort of justifies his actions\n\nthrough the lens of, and his version of how things are,\n\nand he believes he's doing what is appropriate\n\nand needed for his survival, for himself,\n\nbut also for Furiosa,\n\nand the people, the biker horde that he's responsible for.\n\nBut yeah, he's not a nice guy. [chuckles]\n\nWho is Chris Hemsworth,\n\nI'm gonna say, is it, like, related to?\n\nWho is Chris Hemsworth best friend?\n\nBesides you, [Anya giggles]\n\nI've got two guys I work with,\n\nthat I've known since I was six and seven, Zaki and Aza,\n\nYeah. who I think you would've met\n\non the movie. Yeah.\n\nI was gonna say your kids.\n\nYou're a really great dad. My kids.\n\nLet's do that one again, in case they're watching.\n\nOh, my kids, of course.\n\nYour kids. [laughs] And my wife, and my wife.\n\nMy kids and my wife, Yeah, Chris.\n\n[laughing] have always been my best friends.\n\nWhen was Chris Hemsworth, okay,\n\nOn dances. on Dancing with the Stars?\n\nYeah. You're joking.\n\nDon't be surprised. It's, you've seen it.\n\nWhich, no, I haven't.\n\nI swear to God. She used to watch it\n\nevery day on set,\n\nbefore a scene, Which country?\n\nAre there multiple countries? just to totally lose\n\nrespect for me. Wait, wait, wait,\n\nwait, wait, wait. The Australian version.\n\nThere's only seven contestants,\n\never. Can I watch this?\n\nThere's only 10 people in the country.\n\nIs that okay?\n\nYou can watch it, yeah. Can I watch it?\n\nEveryone else can. What was your favorite\n\nkind of dance?\n\n'Cause there's, like, different casts.\n\nI've not seen it, but- The samba.\n\nSamba, okay, cool. Yeah.\n\nAnd then the waltz.\n\nI was really bad, but,\n\nI'm really excited. it gave me [chuckles]\n\nmy finances to come to America.\n\nIt looks really scary, to be honest with you.\n\nLike, I can imagine it's quite, like, stressful\n\nto go and perform in front\n\nof a bunch of people. Oh, it was terrifying.\n\nYeah. It's also terrifying\n\nfor you to watch, probably.\n\nIt's like a cockroach. I won't tell you\n\nwhen I watch it. You won't be able\n\nto look away.\n\nYou'll just be like, No, no, no.\n\nYou'll show up, and I'll have a knowing look in my eye,\n\nand be like, Hi, Chris.\n\n[Interviewer] How far did you go on the show?\n\nOh, fifth, I think. [chuckles]\n\nThat's good! Everyone remembers\n\nfifth place.\n\nThat's good. That was where\n\nI wanted to get. Yeah.\n\nI didn't wanna get any higher.\n\nI believe it.\n\nJust, I didn't want to upset anyone else.\n\nYeah. I felt\n\nfor the other contestants.\n\nSo, it got to five, and I was like, I'm gonna intentionally\n\nscrew this up. Yeah.\n\nWho is Chris Hemsworth related to? I knew it would come up.\n\nA lot of people.\n\nI have two brothers, Luke and Liam.\n\nYour parents. My parents,\n\nthe only, who came.\n\nMy kids.

Yeah,\n\nthat's not really a question, is it?\n\nWhat's?

It's hard work. Yeah.\n\nLike, I was really surprised.\n\nI think the first time I ever did animation,\n\nI threw up after the session,\n\n'cause I'd just been screaming,\n\nOh, wow. for, like, seven hours.\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy Jack Black. Jack Black, I love him.\n\nI very rarely get starstruck, and he was just huge for me,\n\n'cause I loved Tenacious D\n\nas a kid. Yeah.\n\nAnd so, like, I immediately\n\njust scream-sang tribute at him,\n\nand he was very cool about it.\n\nI can't imagine someone coming up to me\n\nand just singing at me.\n\nAnd so, I think he was a really good sport about it.\n\nHe's awesome. Like him a lot.\n\nGood. Thank you.\n\nAre Chris Hemsworth eyes really that blue?\n\nYeah. Yeah, they are. [laughs]\n\nWhere is Limitless Chris Hemsworth filmed?\n\nMostly in Australia, some in America, and then Norway.\n\nI really wanna go to Norway. Yeah.\n\nBeautiful. I really want to go there.\n\nWhy is Chris Hemsworth\n\nnot playing Thor anymore? Not playing Thor anymore.\n\n'Cause I'm playing Dementus, in Furiosa.\n\nProfessional, right there.\n\nI've played Thor, what, eight times now, I think.\n\nLoved every second of it,\n\nand, at the moment, enjoying doing other things,\n\nand who knows what the future holds.\n\n[Anya] Is Chris Hemsworth\n\nGonna play Hulk Hogan. going to play Hulk Hogan?\n\nI'm fascinated. So, Todd Phillips and I\n\nwere talking about this.\n\nHe was gonna direct it.\n\nI don't know where that's at, to be honest. I don't know.\n\nThat's not in the immediate future,\n\nOkay. but it was a discussion,\n\nfor a little while.\n\nBut, hey brother.\n\n[chuckles] No. Yeah!\n\nAll right, let's go.\n\nThat's the same as Optimus Prime, isn't it?\n\nHey, here we go.\n\nFinal card. All right, Anya Taylor-Joy,\n\nwho is Anya Taylor-Joy in Peaky Blinders?\n\nIn Peaky Blinders, I am a real piece of work,\n\nnamed Gina Gray, and I get very weirdly embarrassed\n\nwhen people tell me that they really like me\n\nin Peaky Blinders, because she's awful.\n\nI struggle watching me as Gina.\n\nSo, when people are like, Oh, you're great in that show,\n\nI'm like, Oh, God, you've seen me\n\nbe terrible to people. No, it was cool, though.\n\nThat show is awesome. Thanks.\n\nIt was. It was really, really fun.\n\nYeah, here we go.\n\nWhat languages does Anya Taylor-Joy\n\nSpeak? Speak. speak in The Northman?\n\nGosh, you're testing my memory here.\n\nWe created a form of old Slavic,\n\nOh, wow. for me to be able\n\nto do spells and incantations in.\n\nAnd it was really fun, but also pretty crazy,\n\nbecause you would show up to set,\n\nand just be, like, screaming spells, in a made-up language.\n\nBut I remember Ralph Ineson, who did The Witch, with me,\n\nhe was also on the boat,\n\nwhere I was, like, doing my big one.\n\nAnd I remember his eyes going like,\n\nOh, shit, get out the way, and I was like, Yes!\n\n[chuckling] Yeah, cool.\n\nI scared the big Yorkshire man.\n\nYeah, you guys have a good nod\n\nto the, [clears throat] the Nordic realm.\n\nI chose to just do an Australian accent,\n\n[Anya laughs]\n\nwith a bit of an English twang to it,\n\n'cause, you know, Works great.\n\nthey speak English\n\nin the clouds, don't they? Yeah.\n\n[chuckles] Is Anya Taylor-Joy, dun-dun,\n\noh, come off it. Dude.\n\nThis is not your game. I'm doing it this way.\n\nSee, see, see?\n\nIn Dune Two. In Dune Two.\n\nI am.

Yeah.\n\nIt was a skeleton crew.\n\nDenis and I, in the dunes in Namibia, and it was awesome.\n\nI loved it. Epic.\n\nThanks, love. Okay.\n\nWhat is Chris Hemsworth max bench?\n\nLike, bench press. Oh, max bench.\n\nGot it. Not very good, to be honest.\n\nAs in, it's okay,\n\nbut I don't- I don't buy it.\n\nNo, because I don't do a lot of accumulation of movement.\n\nJust time under tension, you know? A lot of pushups.\n\n30, 40kg dumbbells, so, 80. Kinda my body weight, I guess.\n\n[Anya] What is Chris Hemsworth's favorite song?\n\nAh. What's your favorite song,\n\nbabe?

Very impressive.\n\nThe Teskey Brothers, yeah.\n\nNice. What's your favorite album?\n\nI can't ever\n\nanswer that question. No, see.\n\nIt's like when someone says favorite film,\n\nI just get very deer-in-the-headlights,\n\nand go, Uh, uh, uh,\n\nand, like, rattle off something with animals in it.\n\nWhat tattoos does Chris Hemsworth have?\n\nI've got a Doctor Seuss tattoo up here.\n\nMy daughter, I used to read this book to her,\n\nOh, the Places You'll Go.\n\nI love that book. And then I got the tattoo,\n\nand then, I kinda got sick of the tattoo years later,\n\nand I started getting it removed.\n\nAnd then she's like, Dad, what are you doing?\n\nWhere's he going?\n\nAnd I was like, Oh, I was gonna get it rubbed off.\n\nAnd she said, No, leave it. So it stayed there.\n\nThese, my daughter drew.\n\nI was actually up with a friend one night.\n\nShe woke up, it's like 11 o'clock,\n\nshe's said, Dad, Dad, I can't sleep.\n\nSat on my lap, and started drawing some things,\n\nand these were the things she drew.\n\nThat's beautiful.\n\nAnd someone else who was sitting there was like,\n\nOh, do you know that's the Wheel of Dharma?\n\nThat's the, in Hindu, it meant many things\n\nin different spaces, but the male and female union.\n\nInitials of my family, and that's it.\n\nVery nice. Okay, last one.\n\nWhat age did Chris Hemsworth start acting?\n\nI think my first job, I would've been 18,\n\nwhen I was in high school. Yeah, same.\n\nI was, I did drama class,\n\nI got kicked outta drama class a lot.\n\nWhy? What'd you do?\n\nI just, you know, couldn't sit still,\n\nYeah. and, I just wanted to play.\n\nI wanted to have fun.\n\nAnyway, and then, when I finished school,\n\nI started, I did an acting course,\n\nand started auditioning, and got my first job.\n\nI played King Arthur. I was basically an extra.\n\nHad this, like, red wig.\n\nAnd I didn't have any dialogue,\n\nbut I was King Arthur. But you wore a crown.\n\nI wore a crown. Yeah.\n\nAnd a long wig. Sick.\n\nAll right. I think that's us done.\n\n[card clatters] Whoo-hoo!\n\nI have Googled myself, but it is never a good idea.\n\nI sort of operate with, Someone will tell me,\n\nYeah. if I need to know.\n\nAnd then you try not to read the reviews and things,\n\nand someone goes. [winces]\n\nIt's often my dad, too.\n\nI'm like, Dad, just don't, I don't wanna know.\n\nI don't have to see.\n\nOh, could you believe what they said?\n\nI'm like. Yeah, but that's dads, yeah.\n\nSo, if you're watching, Dad, stop it.\n\n[upbeat music]", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image": "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill,d_placeholder_wired.png,fl_progressive,g_face,h_1080,q_80,w_1920/v1716398615/wired_wi-autocomplete-anya-taylor-joy-and-chris-hemsworth.jpg", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

The team was founded in 2017 and one of its original members, Adrienne So, is still on staff as a senior editor. We also work with a small group of trusted freelance contributors who are experts in their field. You\u2019ll find an author bio that outlines each tester\u2019s expertise on any review we publish. Our mission is to provide the most authentic and engaging buying advice for every product our audience needs or wants, to pioneer product discovery for tech enthusiasts, and to serve as a trusted hub for fair and thoughtful product reviews.\n\nHow does WIRED select products to test and review?\n\nWe\u2019re looking to write about products our readers are interested in, which means everything from groundbreaking new tech to novel gadgets they\u2019ve seen all over social media, to products like bed-in-a-box mattresses where it\u2019s difficult for any individual consumer to do proper comparison shopping. Our audience is tech-savvy, so you\u2019ll see lots of coverage of mobile phones, laptops, gaming devices, and the like, but WIRED readers also like to live comfortably and healthfully, score great deals, and often enjoy outdoor recreation.\n\nWhy should I trust WIRED\u2019s product reviews?\n\nBecause we tell the truth and we do the work. WIRED\u2019s Reviews team tests every product and service we write about, even when we\u2019re picking the best Amazon Prime Day deals. Our product recommendations are made in service to readers and independently of revenue considerations. While we do get a small cut of most sales when readers click to buy recommended products discussed in our product reviews and buying guides, the content in those guides is created through a rigorous and independent editorial process and is subjected to the same high standards as everything else WIRED publishes. Content from our Reviews team is fact-checked by editors and goes through the same prepublication review process as any other WIRED story. When we make a mistake, we immediately correct it and append an editor\u2019s note for transparency as appropriate.\n\nDoes the WIRED Reviews team use generative AI?\n\nNo. We follow the same editorial standards as everything else published by WIRED. You can read our whole policy here, but the gist is that we do not publish stories with text generated by AI, except when AI-generated text is the point of the story.\n\nDo you purchase every product you test?\n\nNo, but we do not accept \u201cfree products\u201d from manufacturers or make any agreements that involve a promise of editorial coverage in exchange for sending us a product. We often accept delivery of review samples directly from PR agencies and brands, which we typically don't pay for. We return or donate these samples after testing. When we know a specific product is of interest to readers and a review sample is not available, WIRED will purchase the product and the writer will donate it after testing.\n\nHow does the WIRED Reviews team conduct testing for product reviews?\n\nHow we test each product depends on what it is. We thoroughly test anything we recommend to readers and try to explain our methodology in each article without bogging it down with excessive detail many readers don\u2019t care about. Our overall goal in all testing is to replicate the product\u2019s regular use as closely as we can\u2014this is why we review mattresses by sleeping on them in our homes rather than dropping a bowling ball on them in a lab where we conduct \u201cnap tests.\u201d Since our testing methodology is a popular question with both readers and brands, we\u2019ve compiled the basic protocols for some of our key coverage areas below.\n\nEbikes: WIRED reviews upward of 50 new ebikes a year by riding them on a variety of terrain for at least 40 miles over the course of at least two weeks. We test cargo bikes by hauling kids and groceries, we ride mountain and gravel bikes on trails, and we test commuter bikes while running errands on regular city streets (including up and down steep hills). In addition to our real-life testing, we evaluate specs like weight, tire size, battery life, motor power, and the sourcing of key components to make our guides to the Best Ebikes and Best Cheap Ebikes.\n\nElectric scooters: WIRED reviewers ride electric scooters for at least 30 miles, though often much longer, on varying terrain and under various power loads (such as laden with groceries or up and down steep hills). Our main tester, the author of our guide to the Best Electric Scooters, is Brooklyn-based Julian Chokkattu, who takes electric scooters on the same routes through Bushwick during his tests so he can evaluate how a scooter may deviate from the established baseline.\n\nFitness trackers: WIRED\u2019s lead tester wears fitness trackers for at least two weeks and evaluates them on fit, specifications, durability, battery life, whether she can see the display in natural daylight, and whether features perform as advertised\u2014for example, AI coaching, climbing software, or GPS tracking. She also evaluates companion smartphone apps based on ease of use and claimed features.\n\nMattresses: We sleep on any mattress we recommend for at least a week in our own homes, though we sometimes give up on a mattress after a few nights (we then tell readers to avoid it), and we will sometimes spend months long-term testing. Lead reviewer Martin Cizmar has established a level of real-life mattress testing that\u2019s unmatched among our competitors, who frequently do a \"nap test\" where they form an opinion after sitting around on a mattress in their office.\n\nOffice chairs: We sit on every chair we test for several weeks while working\u2014two weeks at the minimum, but often much longer than that. We also invite different friends and family members to try the chairs out so we can assess comfort levels for folks with different heights and body types.\n\nMobile phones: To compile our expansive library of smartphone reviews and guides, our testers use any smartphone they\u2019re reviewing for at least a week, but sometimes longer. We test each phone by loading in our own SIM cards and using the phone as we would any personal device for the duration of the testing period. To compare cameras, we take the same photos on a second, similarly priced phone at the same time and study the results. For phone cases, which we test for at least a few days each, we look for alignment between ports and holes, check all buttons for clickiness, judge how it feels in our pockets, and check for how much the case is raised over the screen and camera lenses. We don't do drop tests as we don\u2019t have enough free phones to replace all the broken ones.\n\nInternet routers: WIRED tests Wi-Fi and mesh routers for at least one week, though often longer, in a home setting. We test the stated features and introduce stress testing, such as cutting the power to see how routers cope with a sudden loss of power. Our lead tester, Simon Hill, also runs a bevy of technical tests, including network throughput testing, file transfers, coverage heatmaps, and speed tests\u2014all organized into a handy (and impressive) spreadsheet.\n\nAir Purifiers: WIRED reviews more than 50 new air purifiers a year, assessing them in various home environments from coast to coast for months at a time. We test air purifiers in both homes and 100-year-old apartments with cats, dogs, and gas stoves, and near highways and in urban areas. In addition to our real-world testing, we measure decibel levels, ease of use, and efficacy, and we evaluate cost, design, length of warranty, and most importantly, the rate of air exchange in a specific-size room, making our deep dives, reviews, and Best Air Purifier guide essential reading.\n\nSoundbars: WIRED\u2019s staffers, including Parker Hall and Ryan Waniata, evaluate soundbars using a wide variety of testing material, from custom-made Dolby Atmos demos to familiar movies like Guardians of the Galaxy, sitcoms like Seinfeld and Parks and Recreation, and everything in between. We test apps and features like auto-calibration, surround sound speakers, and multiroom audio integration in multiple settings wherever possible. For music testing, we stream carefully curated playlists and random radio stations at compressed and lossless resolutions over Bluetooth and Wi-Fi where available. We live with these products over multiple days at minimum to test their usability the same way we expect you to use them.\n\nHeadphones and earbuds: Headphones and earbuds come in a multitude of styles, sizes, and varieties and we test them in accordance. For all headphones we test, sound quality, comfort, and fit are of the utmost importance. For wireless headphones and earbuds, we pay special attention to key aspects like ease of pairing and setup, battery life, app connection and settings, and convenience features like speak-to-chat. When focusing on sound quality, we use curated playlists with familiar music (from Fleetwood Mac\u2019s \u201cThe Chain\u201d to The Weeknd\u2019s \u201cStarboy\u201d) in both compressed and lossless resolution where applicable. For spatial audio, we test music and videos in multiple formats, including Dolby Atmos.\n\nTelevisions: TVs are among the most important products in A/V, and we test them accordingly. We spend at least a week with each TV we test, using it day and night as our daily driver. We utilize carefully selected video and audio content (from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows on Blu-ray to Our Planet in Dolby Vision and Atmos on Netflix). Our testing material runs the gamut, including live broadcasts, streaming content, and physical media with high-end Ultra HD Blu-ray players. We use Spears & Munsil\u2019s latest Ultra HD Benchmark discs to lock in settings and evaluate multiple resolution and HDR formats, including Dolby Vision, HDR10, and HDR10+. We watch content in various light conditions and test usability features, from smart assistants to services like AirPlay 2 and Chromecast to paint a holistic picture.\n\nRunning gear: Our lead writer runs four to five times a week, around 20 to 25 miles per week, and evaluates the gear\u2019s overall performance with a mix of long runs, interval runs, and trail and road running.\n\nPizza ovens: To name the best pizza ovens, we test each oven in our backyard for a minimum of two weeks. While using the oven, our testers also use handheld infrared thermometers to take the temperature of the baking stone at various places to gauge how evenly they heat and cook. We test all ovens with homemade dough, store-bought dough, and frozen pizzas.\n\nLuggage and backpacks: WIRED tests luggage designed primarily for air travel by taking it on at least two flights. When reviewing backpacks, our testers wear them for at least two weeks. In addition to this regular use, we also evaluate design details, like whether they have straight or curved zippers, what gauge the zippers are, whether they're toothed or coiled, what the warranty is, whether the hardware is metal or plastic, or whether the fabric is sustainable. Our reviewers also do things like fill backpacks full of books and toss them around, and kick carry-on bags to see whether they get foot marks or are easy to clean.\n\nUmbrellas: Our testers use umbrellas several times, whenever it rains. We test them as a normal person would while checking for the main hallmarks of what makes a good umbrella, as listed in our buying guide. We also aim to get a good sense of how each umbrella handles gusts and heavy storms.\n\nWebcams: We use every webcam we test for several weeks as a daily driver, and our testers also try to compare the image quality with another similar model. Reviewers make audio recordings to see how the mics pick up their voices. Webcam testers often solicit feedback on appearance and sound quality during our weekly Gear team meetings, which take place over Zoom.\n\nBidets: For our guide to the Best Bidets, our testers install the bidets on a toilet in their homes and use each sample for at least a week.\n\nMonitors: Reviewer Nena Farrell leads our coverage of the best computer monitors and tests each pick for at least one week, with a minimum of three working days. She sets monitors up with both a PC and Mac laptop to check performance, and she runs at least two different video games to see how the monitor performs, even if it isn't a monitor designed specifically for video games.\n\nCamp cookware: Reviewer Scott Gilbertson famously lives in an RV, so he is always testing camp cookware. In fact, grills and other cookware are tested for months before they ever make it into a guide. He cooks outside every day, rotating stoves every few months so he gets a good sense of how they perform, how they stand up to weather, and how hard they are to clean.\n\nTents: We aim to spend at least a week in every tent, ideally in a variety of weather conditions. Every pocket, zipper, guy line, and feature is tested. Will the rainfly catch on the door zippers? Is the ventilation good? Is the tent easy to set up? We assess all of the above and more, and list our favorites in our Best Tents buying guide.\n\nMeal kits: When testing meal kit delivery services, each service is evaluated meal-by-meal over the course of a few days. Our lead reviewer follows recipes to the letter and substitutes ingredients only if something arrives inedible\u2014for example, if something thaws during shipment or the produce is moldy (these substitutions are always noted). She always has at least one other person try a meal and notes down both of their first impressions and opinions before discussing the meal further. She assesses packaging, ingredient quality, texture, and taste, then factors in price to make recommendations.\n\nSecurity cameras: Indoor and outdoor security cameras are tested for at least one month. We test any manufacturer claims and special features, like motion detection or smartphone alerts, and stress-test the cameras as well. We also test videofeed quality and loading times.\n\nVideo doorbells: We test video doorbells for a minimum of two weeks. Any manufacturer claims are tested and verified, as are smartphone companion apps or smart home connectivity options. We also consider the data storage, retention, and privacy policies of the manufacturers of each camera we test, as these things also factor into our recommendations.\n\nSex toys and tech: We test sex tech for a minimum of two weeks using common sense. We test on different erogenous zones and different bodies. We also conduct controlled tests for features like battery life, waterproofness, and ease of cleaning. We test manufacturer claims as well.\n\nEspresso machines and coffee gear: We use espresso machines and coffee gear for at least two weeks in everyday situations. We also perform some controlled tests. Our lead reviewer tests for consistency, how hot the heating elements get, how quickly they heat up, how much time needs to pass between switching functions (brewing versus steaming), and the like. She also tests general usability. Is the machine easy to clean and maintain? Are things that need to be cleaned easily accessible? Does it look nice on the counter or does it seem to acquire a grime after only a couple uses? Does the steaming wand work efficiently? All of these factors inform our assessment.\n\nCoffee grinders: Our lead reviewer assesses coffee grinders for at least two weeks using a mix of everyday use and controlled tests. She\u2019s mostly testing for consistency, as well as factors like how quickly grime builds up in the burrs, how accessible the burrs are for cleaning, how loud the grinder is, and how finely or coarsely it can grind. She also assesses for ease of cleaning and overall maintenance requirements.\n\nDigital cameras: We test cameras by using them over a period of (ideally) months, but often just weeks because DSLR cameras, compact system cameras, and mirrorless cameras are generally loaned to us on a short-term basis, and camera companies are eager to pass them on to the next reviewer. Our lead reviewer tries to shoot at least 500 images on every camera he tests. He then views and edits the resulting RAW and JPG files in Darktable.\n\nCoolers: We test coolers by putting a standard bag of cube ice inside it on a warm day (at least 75 degrees Fahrenheit), putting the cooler in the shade, and then timing how long it takes for the ice to melt. We also assess weight, portability, durability, and overall design.\n\nBinoculars: We test binoculars by going birding. And to baseball games. And stargazing. For months and months.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast', 'David Robson', 'Angela Watercutter', 'Mark Harris', 'Adrienne So']", "top_image": "https://www.wired.com/verso/static/wired/assets/favicon.ico", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "WIRED\u2019s \u2018On Background\u2019 Policy", "text": "Many powerful companies make a practice of obfuscating or dodging accountability when speaking to media outlets by providing information while insisting it not be attributed to anyone in particular, and sometimes not even to the company itself. For that reason, WIRED is joining the Verge, Quartz, and others in making its editorial standards clearer.\n\nAnyone talking to WIRED reporters in any official capacity does so on the record by default. This means that what you say or write can be quoted and attributed to you by name, not just as \u201ca company spokesperson.\u201d We typically allow anonymity only to sources who could face retaliation or be endangered by the information they provide, and when we do so we explain our reasons to readers. As Julia Angwin, editor in chief of the Markup, has noted, \u201cCorporate spokespeople who are paid to provide information simply don\u2019t meet the criteria for being granted anonymity.\u201d\n\nSometimes we may agree to have a conversation on background, meaning we can use the information you provide, but will not identify you by name. Conversations are on background only when we agree to it. If you send us a statement \u201con background\u201d without prior agreement, we may still treat it as on the record.\n\nYou must also get our agreement for each proposed condition of the conversation, such as requests to not quote a particular statement directly or to identify a source in a certain way. Please be clear about your exact requests every time you speak with WIRED. At our discretion we may also tell our readers why we\u2019re providing the information in this way.\n\nOff-the-record conversations cannot be used for publication, and they also must be agreed to (which we rarely do for corporate spokespeople).\n\nThe companies you speak for play significant roles in shaping the future; we have a responsibility to tell our readers how we got the information about your plans to shape it.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast', 'David Robson', 'Angela Watercutter', 'Mark Harris', 'Adrienne So']", "top_image": "https://www.wired.com/verso/static/wired/assets/favicon.ico", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "15 Best Mattresses You Can Buy Online (2024)", "text": "You'll spend a third of your life on a mattress, which means picking the right one is important. Start with your preferred sleeping position and how much support you need. Here are a few tips.\n\nShould you buy a firm or soft mattress? Generally, heavier people and back or stomach sleepers will do better with firmer mattresses, while lighter people and side sleepers enjoy softer mattresses. Temperature is also an issue: Softer mattresses sleep warmer since your body is sinking into a layer of fabric and foam. Keep in mind that all mattresses have a break-in period, and the way the mattress feels on your first night won't be how it feels after a week or two.\n\nDo you want a hybrid or foam mattress? The next big question is whether you want a foam mattress or a hybrid model that layers foam with built-in springs. We tend to recommend hybrids because they are more stable and supportive, and they usually stay cooler. Hybrids are often slightly pricier. Foam mattresses tend to be softer, lighter, and cheaper.\n\nWhat size mattress do you need? The prices below are based on the queen size, but almost all mattresses come in the standard sizes of Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, and California King. You'll want to buy a mattress based on the size of your bed frame.\n\nHow easy is it to set up a bed-in-a-box? Most of these mattresses are delivered in a box, vacuum-sealed, and rolled up. Some are pretty heavy\u2014up to 150 pounds\u2014so be sure you have someone to help you. After you unroll your bed-in-a-box mattress and cut the vacuum bag open, it'll immediately begin to inflate, so unbox it on your bed frame or near it. We have a helpful guide on how to set up the mattress you bought online with more tips. The mattresses are usually ready to go in a few hours, but most manufacturers recommend giving them two days to reach their normal state.\n\nShould you wait for a sale to buy a mattress? Mattresses go on sale often. If you see one at full price, there's a strong chance you can save hundreds of dollars by waiting for the next big sale event (every few months).\n\nWhat if you don't like the mattress you bought online? Most of the mattresses we have tested and recommend have at least a 100-night testing period and a 10-year warranty. You may want to look at the company's policy as you may be on the hook for a nominal return fee.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast', 'Martin Cizmar', 'Medea Giordano', 'Eric Ravenscraft', 'Scott Gilbertson', 'Louryn Strampe', 'Julian Chokkattu', 'Adrienne So']", "top_image": "https://media.wired.com/photos/664e22250b09b2ef41a851ac/191:100/w_2580,c_limit/Best-mattress-update-collage-052024-SOURCE-Martin-Cizmar.jpg", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}
