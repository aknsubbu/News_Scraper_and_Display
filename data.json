{"title": "Apex Legends hacker says game developers patched exploit used on streamers", "text": "Last month, a hacker wreaked havoc during an esports tournament of the popular shooter game Apex Legends, hacking two well-known streamers mid-game to make it look like they were using cheats.\n\nA month later, it seems like the hacking saga may have come to a close with the game developers patching the bug exploited by the hacker.\n\nBecause of the hack, the organizers had to suspend the tournament on March 17. Two days later, Apex Legends developer Respawn said on its official X account that it had \u201cdeployed the first of a layered series of updates to protect the Apex Legends player community.\u201d Then a week later, the company wrote that it had \u201cadded another update that is intended to further protect our players and ensure the competitive integrity of Apex Legends.\u201d\n\nRespawn\u2019s posts don\u2019t clearly say that the updates patched the bugs exploited during the tournament. But the hacker behind the cheating scandal told TechCrunch this week that Respawn\u2019s patches fixed the vulnerability that he had exploited to hack the two streamers.\n\n\u201cThe exploit I\u2019ve used in [Apex Legends Global Series] is fully patched,\u201d the hacker, who goes by Destroyer2009, said in an online chat.\n\nDestroyer2009, who previously told TechCrunch that he had hacked the two streamers \u201cfor fun,\u201d said he didn\u2019t want to reveal any technical details of the bug he exploited, even if it is now patched.\n\n\u201cNo one likes when severe vulnerabilities in your product are exposed publicly. I asked my friend and we both agreed that we don\u2019t really want to publicly expose what happened from a technical perspective yet,\u201d the hacker said, referring to a friend he worked with to develop the hack.\n\nContact Us Do you know more about this hack? Or other video game hacking incidents?

You also can contact TechCrunch via SecureDrop\n\nReferring to an unrelated botched in-game update by Respawn this week, Destroyer2009 said: \u201c[I] don\u2019t think embarrassing them even more is fair.\u201d\n\nDestroyer2009 said he tested his exploit after Respawn\u2019s announcement of the second update on March 26, although he said it\u2019s possible it was patched sooner because he didn\u2019t have a chance to test it before.\n\nDestroyer2009\u2019s hacks were high-profile, disruptive and caused a big stir in the Apex Legends community. The two streamers targeted, ImperialHal and Genburten, collectively have 2.5 million followers on the game-streaming platform Twitch, and several other Apex Legends players and streamers commented on the news of the hacks on their channels.\n\nYet, Respawn isn\u2019t being forthcoming about the patches it released. TechCrunch asked Respawn and Electronic Arts, the owners of the development studio, to confirm whether the exploit used by Destroyer2009 is indeed patched, and if so, when it was patched.\n\nBut neither Respawn nor Electronic Arts responded to TechCrunch\u2019s multiple requests for comment. The two companies did not respond to requests for comment in the last few weeks either.\n\nMeanwhile, Destroyer2009 said he won\u2019t do any more public hacks for now, because \u201canything more severe than the [Apex tournament hack] accident will be already considered as a real hacking with all the consequences so [probably] will just play the game until it gets boring as usual.\u201d", "authors": "['Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/apex-legends-concept-art.png?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "Lacework, last valued at $8.3B, is in talks to sell for just $150M to $200M, say sources", "text": "Lacework, last valued at $8.3B, is in talks to sell for just $150M to $200M, say sources Wiz, a rival, is said to be nearing a deal to buy the cloud security startup\n\nConsolidation continues apace in the world of security. Sources tell us that Lacework \u2014 a cloud security startup that was valued at $8.3 billion post-money in its last funding round \u2014 is in talks to be acquired by another security player, Wiz, for a price of just $150 million to $200 million.\n\nSources close to the negotiations said that the two companies have already signed a letter of intent and described the state of negotiations as \u201csomewhere in the middle.\u201d That is to say, the acquisition is not yet completed and the deal could still fall through.\n\nAlthough both work in the wider area of cloud security, sources tell us that there is relatively little competitive overlap between the two companies, so it would likely be a technology-plus-talent-plus-customer acquisition play. We are still trying to find out more terms of the deal, such as whether it would be in stock, cash or a mix.\n\nContacted for comment, Wiz would not confirm nor deny the reports on the record but provided the following statement to TechCrunch:\n\n\u201cWiz has experienced unprecedented organic growth since its inception, and we are dedicated to pushing this growth even further. Simultaneously, we recognize that consolidation is the future of the security industry and therefore are actively engaged in discussions with companies across the industry. We are always exploring compelling M&A opportunities that will enhance both our technological capabilities and business expansion, as we strive to build the world\u2019s leading cloud security platform.\u201d\n\nWiz\u2019s CEO and co-founder Assaf Rappaport \u2014 who co-founded and sold a previous security startup, Adallom, to Microsoft \u2014 has said on a number of occasions (such as here) that Wiz is looking to hit $1 billion in annual recurring revenue ahead of an IPO. We understand that its soft deadline is the end of 2025, but considering it announced ARR of only $350 million in February 2024, the company has to get aggressive to reach its goal. Lacework, we understand, has ARR of around $100 million.\n\nThe Information has reported some of the above details today, too.\n\nThe deal underscores a story of two parts.\n\nPart one: Security startups continue to attract a lot of funding attention, but some companies that have reached high valuations over recent years are struggling to justify those numbers and are considering their options as they come close to the end of their funding runway.\n\nFrom what we understand, Lacework\u2019s investors \u2014 the longer list includes Snowflake Ventures, GV, General Catalyst, Tiger Global and many more \u2014 were shopping the company around to potential buyers, which is how Wiz came into the frame.\n\nLacework, we should note, is not the only security business getting a valuation haircut. Just last week, TechCrunch broke the news that Noname was in talks to be acquired by Akamai for $500 million, after last being valued at $1 billion.\n\nPart two: Other players are emerging as consolidators in this process. Wiz \u2014 valued at around $10 billion \u2014 is one of them.\n\nThe company is positioning itself as a one-stop shop for all things cloud security en route to its IPO. Earlier this month Wiz acquired Gem Security for $350 million, and it sounds like the M&A will not end with Lacework.\n\nLacework, founded nearly nine years ago and based in San Jose, California, has raised over $1.8 billion from investors over the years. Most of that funding \u2014 $1.3 billion \u2014 ties to a late November 2021 round that, at the time, valued the company at $8.3 billion.", "authors": "['Ingrid Lunden']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1724735466.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "Hugging Face releases a benchmark for testing generative AI on health tasks", "text": "Generative AI models are increasingly being brought to healthcare settings \u2014 in some cases prematurely, perhaps. Early adopters believe that they\u2019ll unlock increased efficiency while revealing insights that\u2019d otherwise be missed. Critics, meanwhile, point out that these models have flaws and biases that could contribute to worse health outcomes.\n\nBut is there a quantitative way to know how helpful, or harmful, a model might be when tasked with things like summarizing patient records or answering health-related questions?\n\nHugging Face, the AI startup, proposes a solution in a newly released benchmark test called Open Medical-LLM. Created in partnership with researchers at the nonprofit Open Life Science AI and the University of Edinburgh\u2019s Natural Language Processing Group, Open Medical-LLM aims to standardize evaluating the performance of generative AI models on a range of medical-related tasks.\n\nNew: Open Medical LLM Leaderboard! \ud83e\ude7a In basic chatbots, errors are annoyances.\n\nIn medical LLMs, errors can have life-threatening consequences \ud83e\ude78 It's therefore vital to benchmark/follow advances in medical LLMs before thinking about deployment. Blog: https://t.co/pddLtkmhsz \u2014 Cl\u00e9mentine Fourrier \ud83c\udf4a (@clefourrier) April 18, 2024\n\nOpen Medical-LLM isn\u2019t a from-scratch benchmark, per se, but rather a stitching-together of existing test sets \u2014 MedQA, PubMedQA, MedMCQA and so on \u2014 designed to probe models for general medical knowledge and related fields, such as anatomy, pharmacology, genetics and clinical practice. The benchmark contains multiple choice and open-ended questions that require medical reasoning and understanding, drawing from material including U.S. and Indian medical licensing exams and college biology test question banks.\n\n\u201c[Open Medical-LLM] enables researchers and practitioners to identify the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, drive further advancements in the field and ultimately contribute to better patient care and outcome,\u201d Hugging Face wrote in a blog post.\n\nHugging Face is positioning the benchmark as a \u201crobust assessment\u201d of healthcare-bound generative AI models. But some medical experts on social media cautioned against putting too much stock into Open Medical-LLM, lest it lead to ill-informed deployments.\n\nOn X, Liam McCoy, a resident physician in neurology at the University of Alberta, pointed out that the gap between the \u201ccontrived environment\u201d of medical question-answering and actual clinical practice can be quite large.\n\nIt is great progress to see these comparisons head-to-head, but important for us to also remember how big the gap is between the contrived environment of medical question answering and actual clinical practice! Not to mention the idiosyncratic risks these metrics can't capture. \u2014 Liam McCoy, MD MSc (@LiamGMcCoy) April 18, 2024\n\nHugging Face research scientist Cl\u00e9mentine Fourrier, who co-authored the blog post, agreed.\n\n\u201cThese leaderboards should only be used as a first approximation of which [generative AI model] to explore for a given use case, but then a deeper phase of testing is always needed to examine the model\u2019s limits and relevance in real conditions,\u201d Fourrier replied on X. \u201cMedical [models] should absolutely not be used on their own by patients, but instead should be trained to become support tools for MDs.\u201d\n\nIt brings to mind Google\u2019s experience when it tried to bring an AI screening tool for diabetic retinopathy to healthcare systems in Thailand.\n\nGoogle created a deep learning system that scanned images of the eye, looking for evidence of retinopathy, a leading cause of vision loss. But despite high theoretical accuracy, the tool proved impractical in real-world testing, frustrating both patients and nurses with inconsistent results and a general lack of harmony with on-the-ground practices.\n\nIt\u2019s telling that of the 139 AI-related medical devices the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved to date, none use generative AI. It\u2019s exceptionally difficult to test how a generative AI tool\u2019s performance in the lab will translate to hospitals and outpatient clinics, and, perhaps more importantly, how the outcomes might trend over time.\n\nThat\u2019s not to suggest Open Medical-LLM isn\u2019t useful or informative. The results leaderboard, if nothing else, serves as a reminder of just how poorly models answer basic health questions. But Open Medical-LLM, and no other benchmark for that matter, is a substitute for carefully thought-out real-world testing.", "authors": "['Kyle Wiggers']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-924555544.jpg?resize=1200,800", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/18/tesla-semi-big-rig-charging-corridor-biden-funding/
{"title": "Tesla still plans to build 1,800-mile charging corridor for semi trucks despite Biden funding snub", "text": "Tesla is pushing forward with a plan to build an electric big rig charging corridor stretching from Texas to California, despite being snubbed by a lucrative federal funding program that\u2019s part of President Biden\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. But the original scope of the project could still change, TechCrunch has learned.\n\nThe company had been seeking nearly $100 million from the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) Discretionary Grant program under the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Combined with around $24 million of its own money, Tesla wanted to build nine electric semi-truck charging stations between Laredo, Texas and Fremont, California.\n\nThe corridor, if built, would be a first-of-its-kind charging network that could enable both long-distance and regional electric trucking and help clean up a big chunk of the otherwise dirty transportation sector. Without it, though, Tesla\u2019s promise to electrify heavy-duty trucking could fall even further behind schedule than it already is.\n\nThe project as pitched to the FHWA was called TESSERACT, which stands for \u201cTransport Electrification Supporting Semis Operating in Arizona, California, and Texas,\u201d according to a slide buried in a 964-page filing with the South Coast Air Quality Management District. (Tesla collaborated with SCAQMD on the application.)\n\nBut Tesla was not among the 47 recipients that the Biden administration announced in January. Collectively, those winners received $623 million to build electric vehicle charging and refueling stations across the country. This is despite Tesla winning around 13% of all other charging awards so far from the Infrastructure Act, though that has only netted the company around $17 million.\n\nRohan Patel, who left his VP position at Tesla this week as the company laid off 10% of its workforce, said in a message to TechCrunch that Tesla may turn to state funding opportunities, or future rounds of the CFI program. Some of the sites along the route \u201care no-brainers even without funding,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 1,800-mile route would theoretically connect Tesla\u2019s two North American vehicle factories, as well as one that is planned \u2014 but delayed \u2014 in Mexico. Each station was originally slated to be equipped with eight 750kW chargers for Tesla Semis, and four chargers open to other electric trucks. It\u2019s unclear how effective it would be if the company was unable to build all nine stations, which are situated at roughly equal distances along the route.\n\nAbout half of the Biden administration\u2019s choices for the CFI funding focused on building out EV charging infrastructure in \u201curban and rural communities, including at convenient and high-use locations like schools, parks, libraries, multi-family housing, and more.\u201d\n\nThe other half was dedicated to funding 11 \u201ccorridor\u201d projects, including a number on the same I-10 corridor that makes up part of Tesla\u2019s proposed route. That includes $70 million to the North Texas Council of Governments to build up to five hydrogen fueling stations for medium and heavy-duty trucks in the Dallas, Houston, Austin and San Antonio areas.\n\n\u201cThe project will help create a hydrogen corridor from southern California to Texas,\u201d the Department of Transportation wrote in a statement in January.\n\n\u201cFunding hydrogen stations will go down as purely wasted money,\u201d Patel told TechCrunch this week.\n\nWhile he no longer speaks on behalf of Tesla, he also criticized funding hydrogen infrastructure when he was still with the company.\n\n\u201cGovernments around the globe are wasting tax dollars on hydrogen for light/heavy duty infrastructure,\u201d he wrote on X in February. \u201cLike smoking, it\u2019s never too late to quit.\u201d\n\nFunding isn\u2019t the only challenge to the project. Another complicating factor could be Tesla\u2019s recent restructuring.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has said the company is now \u201cballs to the wall for autonomy,\u201d and has reportedly already sacrificed a planned low-cost EV in favor of making a purpose-built robotaxi the company\u2019s priority. The Semi is years behind schedule, and Tesla has only built around 100 to date.\n\nDespite all this, the Tesla Semi program is still slowly attracting customers. Just a few days after the restructuring, the head of the Semi program, Dan Priestley, announced via social media a new potential customer for the trucks. Priestley also said in March that Tesla has been using Semis to ship battery packs from Nevada to the Fremont factory.", "authors": "[\"Sean O'Kane\"]", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tesla-semi-charging.jpg?resize=1200,800", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

Now, you don\u2019t need to jailbreak your iPhone or download any sketchy software \u2014 you can get a sophisticated emulator right in the palm of your hand for free on the App Store.\n\nNo one is more vindicated by this shift in Apple\u2019s policy than Riley Testut, the developer who made GBA4iOS about a decade ago when he was in high school (when he released GBA4iOS, I showed half of my AP Statistics class how to play Pok\u00e9mon on their phones during class \u2014 sorry, Mr. Cinelli). But back then, you had to sideload the app through a loophole, and eventually, Apple caught on and ruined our fun. By fall 2014, GBA4iOS was dead. RIP.\n\nbefore emulating Pokemon on my iPhone I had to use my TI-84 like an animal pic.twitter.com/t7uMj8J5KS \u2014 Riles \ud83e\udee1 (@rileytestut) June 7, 2022\n\nSo why the change of heart now, almost 10 years later? It\u2019s probably a mixture of pressure from changing laws in the European Union, as well as increasing pressure for Apple to at least try to stop acting like a monopoly. Now, at long last, Testut has released a Game Boy emulator directly into the iOS App Store, where it has already climbed to No. 1 on the entertainment charts, as well as the free app charts generally. Delta, the emulator, even supports DS, N64, SNES and NES games, in addition to Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance games.\n\nIf you want to finally play Pok\u00e9mon on your iPhone, here\u2019s what you need to do:\n\nDownload Delta. No jailbreaking! No sideloading! It\u2019s finally just a normal app!\n\nNow, how do you get games? This is where it gets tricky. If you\u2019re a Paladin-esque rule follower, you can use a tool like Epilogue\u2019s GB Operator, which can rip .ROM files directly from the Game Boy games that you already own.\n\nBut maybe you don\u2019t have the Pok\u00e9mon Emerald cartridge that your parents bought for you when you were nine years old. While downloading an emulator like Delta is not illegal, downloading .ROM files can be considered piracy, which is not a practice that we condone.\n\nOn a completely unrelated note: You know how sometimes when you have a question, you search for related communities on Reddit that might help you answer that question?\n\nSo, now that you have legally obtained your .ROM file, how do you get it onto your phone? You can put it on Google Drive and add it to your iPhone\u2019s files folder, you can email it to yourself and download it\u2026 basically you just want to do whatever is easiest for you to get that coveted .GBA file at your fingertips.\n\nNote that only certain file types are supported by GBA4iOS. If you got your game in a .ZIP or .7Z file, you need to actually unzip it first. I used the iZip app \u2014 also free in the App Store \u2014 but this sort of thing is generally more straightforward if you just download it on your computer.\n\nNow, when you open Delta, you\u2019ll see a plus sign in the upper-right corner. From there, you can import your games from iTunes or your files folder.\n\nTime to party!\n\nMaybe you just want to play a classic game from your youth. But don\u2019t sleep on ROM hacking communities, which have been modding retro games for decades. These developers can create professional-quality patches for your .ROM files that transport you into completely new games (but you probably want to do the patching on an actual computer).

{"title": "Internet users are getting younger; now the UK is weighing up if AI can help protect them", "text": "Internet users are getting younger; now the UK is weighing up if AI can help protect them\n\nArtificial intelligence has been in the crosshairs of governments over how it might be misused for fraud, disinformation and other malicious online activity; now a U.K. regulator wants to explore how AI is used on the other side: in the fight against malicious content when it involves children.\n\nOfcom, the regulator charged with enforcing the U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act, it plans to launch a consultation on how AI and other automated tools are used today, and can be used in the future, to proactively detect and remove illegal content online, specifically to protect children from harmful content and to identify child sex abuse material previously hard to detect.\n\nThe move coincides with Ofcom publishing research showing that younger users are more connected than ever before: among children as young as 3 or 4 years old, some 84% are already going online; and nearly one-quarter of 5-7 year-olds surveyed already own their own smartphones.\n\nThe tools that Ofcom is introducing would be part of a wider set of proposals the regulator is putting together focused on online child safety measures. Consultations for the comprehensive proposals will start in the coming weeks with the AI consultation coming later this year, Ofcom said.\n\nMark Bunting, a director in Ofcom\u2019s Online Safety Group, says that its interest in AI will start with a look at how well it\u2019s used as a screening tool today.\n\n\u201cSome services do already use those tools to identify and shield children from this content,\u201d he said in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cBut there isn\u2019t much information about how accurate and effective those tools are. We want to look at ways in which we can ensure that industry is assessing [that] when they\u2019re using them, making sure that risks to free expression and privacy are being managed.\u201d\n\nOne likely result will be Ofcom recommending how and what platforms should assess, which could potentially lead not only to the platforms adopting more sophisticated tooling, but potentially fines if they fail to deliver improvements either in blocking content, or creating better ways to keep younger users from seeing it.\n\n\u201cAs with a lot of online safety regulation, the responsibility sits with the firms to make sure that they\u2019re taking appropriate steps and using appropriate tools to protect users,\u201d he said.\n\nThere will be both critics and supporters of the moves. AI researchers are finding ever-more sophisticated ways of using AI to detect, for example, deepfakes, as well as to verify users online. Yet there are just as many skeptics who note that AI detection is far from foolproof.\n\nOfcom announced the consultation on AI tools at the same time it published its latest research into how children are engaging online in the U.K., which found that overall, there are more younger children connected up than ever before, so much so that Ofcom is now breaking out activity among ever-younger age brackets.\n\nMobile tech is particularly sticky and increasing with children these days. In surveys of parents and students ranging between 2,000 and 3,400 respondents (depending on the questions being asked), nearly one-quarter, 24%, of all 5- to 7-year-olds now own their own smartphones, and when you include tablets, the numbers go up to 76%.\n\nThat same age bracket is also using media a lot more on those devices: 65% have made voice and video calls (versus 59% just a year ago), and half of the kids (versus 39% a year ago) are watching streamed media.\n\nAge restrictions around some mainstream social media apps are getting lower, yet whatever the limits, in the U.K. they do not appear to be heeded anyway. Some 38% of 5- to 7-year-olds are using social media, Ofcom found. Meta\u2019s WhatsApp, at 37%, is the most popular app among them.\n\nAnd in possibly the first instance of Meta\u2019s flagship image app being relieved to be less popular than ByteDance\u2019s viral sensation, TikTok was found to be used by 30% of 5- to 7-year-olds, with Instagram at \u201cjust\u201d 22%. Discord rounded out the list but is significantly less popular at only 4%.\n\nAround one-third, 32%, of kids of this age are going online on their own, and 30% of parents said that they were fine with their underaged children having social media profiles. YouTube Kids remains the most popular network for younger users, at 48%.\n\nGaming, a perennial favorite with children, has grown to be used by 41% of 5- to 7-year-olds, with 15% of kids of this age bracket playing shooter games.\n\nWhile 76% of parents surveyed said that they talked to their young children about staying safe online, there are question marks, Ofcom points out, between what a child sees and what that child might report. In researching older children aged 8-17, Ofcom interviewed them directly. It found that 32% of the kids reported that they\u2019d seen worrying content online, but only 20% of their parents said they reported anything.\n\nEven accounting for some reporting inconsistencies, \u201cThe research suggests a disconnect between older children\u2019s exposure to potentially harmful content online, and what they share with their parents about their online experiences,\u201d Ofcom writes. And worrying content is just one challenge: deepfakes are also an issue. Among children aged 16-17, Ofcom said, 25% said they were not confident about distinguishing fake from real online.", "authors": "['Ingrid Lunden']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-499479381.jpg?resize=1200,800", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

We want to look at ways in which we can ensure that industry is assessing [that] when they\u2019re using them, making sure that risks to free expression and privacy are being managed.\u201d\n\nOne likely result will be Ofcom recommending how and what platforms should assess, which could potentially lead not only to the platforms adopting more sophisticated tooling, but potentially fines if they fail to deliver improvements either in blocking content, or creating better ways to keep younger users from seeing it.\n\n\u201cAs with a lot of online safety regulation, the responsibility sits with the firms to make sure that they\u2019re taking appropriate steps and using appropriate tools to protect users,\u201d he said.\n\nThere will be both critics and supporters of the moves. AI researchers are finding ever-more sophisticated ways of using AI to detect, for example, deepfakes, as well as to verify users online. Yet there are just as many skeptics who note that AI detection is far from foolproof.\n\nOfcom announced the consultation on AI tools at the same time it published its latest research into how children are engaging online in the U.K., which found that overall, there are more younger children connected up than ever before, so much so that Ofcom is now breaking out activity among ever-younger age brackets.\n\nMobile tech is particularly sticky and increasing with children these days. In surveys of parents and students ranging between 2,000 and 3,400 respondents (depending on the questions being asked), nearly one-quarter, 24%, of all 5- to 7-year-olds now own their own smartphones, and when you include tablets, the numbers go up to 76%.\n\nThat same age bracket is also using media a lot more on those devices: 65% have made voice and video calls (versus 59% just a year ago), and half of the kids (versus 39% a year ago) are watching streamed media.\n\nAge restrictions around some mainstream social media apps are getting lower, yet whatever the limits, in the U.K. they do not appear to be heeded anyway. Some 38% of 5- to 7-year-olds are using social media, Ofcom found. Meta\u2019s WhatsApp, at 37%, is the most popular app among them.\n\nAnd in possibly the first instance of Meta\u2019s flagship image app being relieved to be less popular than ByteDance\u2019s viral sensation, TikTok was found to be used by 30% of 5- to 7-year-olds, with Instagram at \u201cjust\u201d 22%. Discord rounded out the list but is significantly less popular at only 4%.\n\nAround one-third, 32%, of kids of this age are going online on their own, and 30% of parents said that they were fine with their underaged children having social media profiles. YouTube Kids remains the most popular network for younger users, at 48%.\n\nGaming, a perennial favorite with children, has grown to be used by 41% of 5- to 7-year-olds, with 15% of kids of this age bracket playing shooter games.\n\nWhile 76% of parents surveyed said that they talked to their young children about staying safe online, there are question marks, Ofcom points out, between what a child sees and what that child might report. In researching older children aged 8-17, Ofcom interviewed them directly. It found that 32% of the kids reported that they\u2019d seen worrying content online, but only 20% of their parents said they reported anything.\n\nEven accounting for some reporting inconsistencies, \u201cThe research suggests a disconnect between older children\u2019s exposure to potentially harmful content online, and what they share with their parents about their online experiences,\u201d Ofcom writes. And worrying content is just one challenge: deepfakes are also an issue. Among children aged 16-17, Ofcom said, 25% said they were not confident about distinguishing fake from real online.", "authors": "['Ingrid Lunden']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-499479381.jpg?resize=1200,800", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "Tesla still plans to build 1,800-mile charging corridor for semi trucks despite Biden funding snub", "text": "Tesla is pushing forward with a plan to build an electric big rig charging corridor stretching from Texas to California, despite being snubbed by a lucrative federal funding program that\u2019s part of President Biden\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. But the original scope of the project could still change, TechCrunch has learned.\n\nThe company had been seeking nearly $100 million from the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) Discretionary Grant program under the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Combined with around $24 million of its own money, Tesla wanted to build nine electric semi-truck charging stations between Laredo, Texas and Fremont, California.\n\nThe corridor, if built, would be a first-of-its-kind charging network that could enable both long-distance and regional electric trucking and help clean up a big chunk of the otherwise dirty transportation sector. Without it, though, Tesla\u2019s promise to electrify heavy-duty trucking could fall even further behind schedule than it already is.\n\nThe project as pitched to the FHWA was called TESSERACT, which stands for \u201cTransport Electrification Supporting Semis Operating in Arizona, California, and Texas,\u201d according to a slide buried in a 964-page filing with the South Coast Air Quality Management District. (Tesla collaborated with SCAQMD on the application.)\n\nBut Tesla was not among the 47 recipients that the Biden administration announced in January. Collectively, those winners received $623 million to build electric vehicle charging and refueling stations across the country. This is despite Tesla winning around 13% of all other charging awards so far from the Infrastructure Act, though that has only netted the company around $17 million.\n\nRohan Patel, who left his VP position at Tesla this week as the company laid off 10% of its workforce, said in a message to TechCrunch that Tesla may turn to state funding opportunities, or future rounds of the CFI program. Some of the sites along the route \u201care no-brainers even without funding,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 1,800-mile route would theoretically connect Tesla\u2019s two North American vehicle factories, as well as one that is planned \u2014 but delayed \u2014 in Mexico. Each station was originally slated to be equipped with eight 750kW chargers for Tesla Semis, and four chargers open to other electric trucks. It\u2019s unclear how effective it would be if the company was unable to build all nine stations, which are situated at roughly equal distances along the route.\n\nAbout half of the Biden administration\u2019s choices for the CFI funding focused on building out EV charging infrastructure in \u201curban and rural communities, including at convenient and high-use locations like schools, parks, libraries, multi-family housing, and more.\u201d\n\nThe other half was dedicated to funding 11 \u201ccorridor\u201d projects, including a number on the same I-10 corridor that makes up part of Tesla\u2019s proposed route. That includes $70 million to the North Texas Council of Governments to build up to five hydrogen fueling stations for medium and heavy-duty trucks in the Dallas, Houston, Austin and San Antonio areas.\n\n\u201cThe project will help create a hydrogen corridor from southern California to Texas,\u201d the Department of Transportation wrote in a statement in January.\n\n\u201cFunding hydrogen stations will go down as purely wasted money,\u201d Patel told TechCrunch this week.\n\nWhile he no longer speaks on behalf of Tesla, he also criticized funding hydrogen infrastructure when he was still with the company.\n\n\u201cGovernments around the globe are wasting tax dollars on hydrogen for light/heavy duty infrastructure,\u201d he wrote on X in February. \u201cLike smoking, it\u2019s never too late to quit.\u201d\n\nFunding isn\u2019t the only challenge to the project. Another complicating factor could be Tesla\u2019s recent restructuring.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has said the company is now \u201cballs to the wall for autonomy,\u201d and has reportedly already sacrificed a planned low-cost EV in favor of making a purpose-built robotaxi the company\u2019s priority. The Semi is years behind schedule, and Tesla has only built around 100 to date.\n\nDespite all this, the Tesla Semi program is still slowly attracting customers. Just a few days after the restructuring, the head of the Semi program, Dan Priestley, announced via social media a new potential customer for the trucks. Priestley also said in March that Tesla has been using Semis to ship battery packs from Nevada to the Fremont factory.", "authors": "[\"Sean O'Kane\"]", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tesla-semi-charging.jpg?resize=1200,800", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "Tesla still plans to build 1,800-mile charging corridor for semi trucks despite Biden funding snub", "text": "Tesla is pushing forward with a plan to build an electric big rig charging corridor stretching from Texas to California, despite being snubbed by a lucrative federal funding program that\u2019s part of President Biden\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. But the original scope of the project could still change, TechCrunch has learned.\n\nThe company had been seeking nearly $100 million from the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) Discretionary Grant program under the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Combined with around $24 million of its own money, Tesla wanted to build nine electric semi-truck charging stations between Laredo, Texas and Fremont, California.\n\nThe corridor, if built, would be a first-of-its-kind charging network that could enable both long-distance and regional electric trucking and help clean up a big chunk of the otherwise dirty transportation sector. Without it, though, Tesla\u2019s promise to electrify heavy-duty trucking could fall even further behind schedule than it already is.\n\nThe project as pitched to the FHWA was called TESSERACT, which stands for \u201cTransport Electrification Supporting Semis Operating in Arizona, California, and Texas,\u201d according to a slide buried in a 964-page filing with the South Coast Air Quality Management District. (Tesla collaborated with SCAQMD on the application.)\n\nBut Tesla was not among the 47 recipients that the Biden administration announced in January. Collectively, those winners received $623 million to build electric vehicle charging and refueling stations across the country. This is despite Tesla winning around 13% of all other charging awards so far from the Infrastructure Act, though that has only netted the company around $17 million.\n\nRohan Patel, who left his VP position at Tesla this week as the company laid off 10% of its workforce, said in a message to TechCrunch that Tesla may turn to state funding opportunities, or future rounds of the CFI program. Some of the sites along the route \u201care no-brainers even without funding,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 1,800-mile route would theoretically connect Tesla\u2019s two North American vehicle factories, as well as one that is planned \u2014 but delayed \u2014 in Mexico. Each station was originally slated to be equipped with eight 750kW chargers for Tesla Semis, and four chargers open to other electric trucks. It\u2019s unclear how effective it would be if the company was unable to build all nine stations, which are situated at roughly equal distances along the route.\n\nAbout half of the Biden administration\u2019s choices for the CFI funding focused on building out EV charging infrastructure in \u201curban and rural communities, including at convenient and high-use locations like schools, parks, libraries, multi-family housing, and more.\u201d\n\nThe other half was dedicated to funding 11 \u201ccorridor\u201d projects, including a number on the same I-10 corridor that makes up part of Tesla\u2019s proposed route. That includes $70 million to the North Texas Council of Governments to build up to five hydrogen fueling stations for medium and heavy-duty trucks in the Dallas, Houston, Austin and San Antonio areas.\n\n\u201cThe project will help create a hydrogen corridor from southern California to Texas,\u201d the Department of Transportation wrote in a statement in January.\n\n\u201cFunding hydrogen stations will go down as purely wasted money,\u201d Patel told TechCrunch this week.\n\nWhile he no longer speaks on behalf of Tesla, he also criticized funding hydrogen infrastructure when he was still with the company.\n\n\u201cGovernments around the globe are wasting tax dollars on hydrogen for light/heavy duty infrastructure,\u201d he wrote on X in February. \u201cLike smoking, it\u2019s never too late to quit.\u201d\n\nFunding isn\u2019t the only challenge to the project. Another complicating factor could be Tesla\u2019s recent restructuring.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has said the company is now \u201cballs to the wall for autonomy,\u201d and has reportedly already sacrificed a planned low-cost EV in favor of making a purpose-built robotaxi the company\u2019s priority. The Semi is years behind schedule, and Tesla has only built around 100 to date.\n\nDespite all this, the Tesla Semi program is still slowly attracting customers. Just a few days after the restructuring, the head of the Semi program, Dan Priestley, announced via social media a new potential customer for the trucks. Priestley also said in March that Tesla has been using Semis to ship battery packs from Nevada to the Fremont factory.", "authors": "[\"Sean O'Kane\"]", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tesla-semi-charging.jpg?resize=1200,800", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

Sources tell us that Lacework \u2014 a cloud security startup that was valued at $8.3 billion post-money in its last funding round \u2014 is in talks to be acquired by another security player, Wiz, for a price of just $150 million to $200 million.\n\nSources close to the negotiations said that the two companies have already signed a letter of intent and described the state of negotiations as \u201csomewhere in the middle.\u201d That is to say, the acquisition is not yet completed and the deal could still fall through.\n\nAlthough both work in the wider area of cloud security, sources tell us that there is relatively little competitive overlap between the two companies, so it would likely be a technology-plus-talent-plus-customer acquisition play. We are still trying to find out more terms of the deal, such as whether it would be in stock, cash or a mix.\n\nContacted for comment, Wiz would not confirm nor deny the reports on the record but provided the following statement to TechCrunch:\n\n\u201cWiz has experienced unprecedented organic growth since its inception, and we are dedicated to pushing this growth even further. Simultaneously, we recognize that consolidation is the future of the security industry and therefore are actively engaged in discussions with companies across the industry. We are always exploring compelling M&A opportunities that will enhance both our technological capabilities and business expansion, as we strive to build the world\u2019s leading cloud security platform.\u201d\n\nWiz\u2019s CEO and co-founder Assaf Rappaport \u2014 who co-founded and sold a previous security startup, Adallom, to Microsoft \u2014 has said on a number of occasions (such as here) that Wiz is looking to hit $1 billion in annual recurring revenue ahead of an IPO. We understand that its soft deadline is the end of 2025, but considering it announced ARR of only $350 million in February 2024, the company has to get aggressive to reach its goal. Lacework, we understand, has ARR of around $100 million.\n\nThe Information has reported some of the above details today, too.\n\nThe deal underscores a story of two parts.\n\nPart one: Security startups continue to attract a lot of funding attention, but some companies that have reached high valuations over recent years are struggling to justify those numbers and are considering their options as they come close to the end of their funding runway.\n\nFrom what we understand, Lacework\u2019s investors \u2014 the longer list includes Snowflake Ventures, GV, General Catalyst, Tiger Global and many more \u2014 were shopping the company around to potential buyers, which is how Wiz came into the frame.\n\nLacework, we should note, is not the only security business getting a valuation haircut. Just last week, TechCrunch broke the news that Noname was in talks to be acquired by Akamai for $500 million, after last being valued at $1 billion.\n\nPart two: Other players are emerging as consolidators in this process. Wiz \u2014 valued at around $10 billion \u2014 is one of them.\n\nThe company is positioning itself as a one-stop shop for all things cloud security en route to its IPO. Earlier this month Wiz acquired Gem Security for $350 million, and it sounds like the M&A will not end with Lacework.\n\nLacework, founded nearly nine years ago and based in San Jose, California, has raised over $1.8 billion from investors over the years.

{"title": "Lacework, last valued at $8.3B, is in talks to sell for just $150M to $200M, say sources", "text": "Lacework, last valued at $8.3B, is in talks to sell for just $150M to $200M, say sources Wiz, a rival, is said to be nearing a deal to buy the cloud security startup\n\nConsolidation continues apace in the world of security. Sources tell us that Lacework \u2014 a cloud security startup that was valued at $8.3 billion post-money in its last funding round \u2014 is in talks to be acquired by another security player, Wiz, for a price of just $150 million to $200 million.\n\nSources close to the negotiations said that the two companies have already signed a letter of intent and described the state of negotiations as \u201csomewhere in the middle.\u201d That is to say, the acquisition is not yet completed and the deal could still fall through.\n\nAlthough both work in the wider area of cloud security, sources tell us that there is relatively little competitive overlap between the two companies, so it would likely be a technology-plus-talent-plus-customer acquisition play. We are still trying to find out more terms of the deal, such as whether it would be in stock, cash or a mix.\n\nContacted for comment, Wiz would not confirm nor deny the reports on the record but provided the following statement to TechCrunch:\n\n\u201cWiz has experienced unprecedented organic growth since its inception, and we are dedicated to pushing this growth even further. Simultaneously, we recognize that consolidation is the future of the security industry and therefore are actively engaged in discussions with companies across the industry. We are always exploring compelling M&A opportunities that will enhance both our technological capabilities and business expansion, as we strive to build the world\u2019s leading cloud security platform.\u201d\n\nWiz\u2019s CEO and co-founder Assaf Rappaport \u2014 who co-founded and sold a previous security startup, Adallom, to Microsoft \u2014 has said on a number of occasions (such as here) that Wiz is looking to hit $1 billion in annual recurring revenue ahead of an IPO. We understand that its soft deadline is the end of 2025, but considering it announced ARR of only $350 million in February 2024, the company has to get aggressive to reach its goal. Lacework, we understand, has ARR of around $100 million.\n\nThe Information has reported some of the above details today, too.\n\nThe deal underscores a story of two parts.\n\nPart one: Security startups continue to attract a lot of funding attention, but some companies that have reached high valuations over recent years are struggling to justify those numbers and are considering their options as they come close to the end of their funding runway.\n\nFrom what we understand, Lacework\u2019s investors \u2014 the longer list includes Snowflake Ventures, GV, General Catalyst, Tiger Global and many more \u2014 were shopping the company around to potential buyers, which is how Wiz came into the frame.\n\nLacework, we should note, is not the only security business getting a valuation haircut. Just last week, TechCrunch broke the news that Noname was in talks to be acquired by Akamai for $500 million, after last being valued at $1 billion.\n\nPart two: Other players are emerging as consolidators in this process. Wiz \u2014 valued at around $10 billion \u2014 is one of them.\n\nThe company is positioning itself as a one-stop shop for all things cloud security en route to its IPO. Earlier this month Wiz acquired Gem Security for $350 million, and it sounds like the M&A will not end with Lacework.\n\nLacework, founded nearly nine years ago and based in San Jose, California, has raised over $1.8 billion from investors over the years. Most of that funding \u2014 $1.3 billion \u2014 ties to a late November 2021 round that, at the time, valued the company at $8.3 billion.", "authors": "['Ingrid Lunden']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1724735466.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

Now, you don\u2019t need to jailbreak your iPhone or download any sketchy software \u2014 you can get a sophisticated emulator right in the palm of your hand for free on the App Store.\n\nNo one is more vindicated by this shift in Apple\u2019s policy than Riley Testut, the developer who made GBA4iOS about a decade ago when he was in high school (when he released GBA4iOS, I showed half of my AP Statistics class how to play Pok\u00e9mon on their phones during class \u2014 sorry, Mr. Cinelli). But back then, you had to sideload the app through a loophole, and eventually, Apple caught on and ruined our fun. By fall 2014, GBA4iOS was dead. RIP.\n\nbefore emulating Pokemon on my iPhone I had to use my TI-84 like an animal pic.twitter.com/t7uMj8J5KS \u2014 Riles \ud83e\udee1 (@rileytestut) June 7, 2022\n\nSo why the change of heart now, almost 10 years later? It\u2019s probably a mixture of pressure from changing laws in the European Union, as well as increasing pressure for Apple to at least try to stop acting like a monopoly. Now, at long last, Testut has released a Game Boy emulator directly into the iOS App Store, where it has already climbed to No. 1 on the entertainment charts, as well as the free app charts generally. Delta, the emulator, even supports DS, N64, SNES and NES games, in addition to Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance games.\n\nIf you want to finally play Pok\u00e9mon on your iPhone, here\u2019s what you need to do:\n\nDownload Delta. No jailbreaking! No sideloading! It\u2019s finally just a normal app!\n\nNow, how do you get games? This is where it gets tricky. If you\u2019re a Paladin-esque rule follower, you can use a tool like Epilogue\u2019s GB Operator, which can rip .ROM files directly from the Game Boy games that you already own.\n\nBut maybe you don\u2019t have the Pok\u00e9mon Emerald cartridge that your parents bought for you when you were nine years old. While downloading an emulator like Delta is not illegal, downloading .ROM files can be considered piracy, which is not a practice that we condone.\n\nOn a completely unrelated note: You know how sometimes when you have a question, you search for related communities on Reddit that might help you answer that question?\n\nSo, now that you have legally obtained your .ROM file, how do you get it onto your phone? You can put it on Google Drive and add it to your iPhone\u2019s files folder, you can email it to yourself and download it\u2026 basically you just want to do whatever is easiest for you to get that coveted .GBA file at your fingertips.\n\nNote that only certain file types are supported by GBA4iOS. If you got your game in a .ZIP or .7Z file, you need to actually unzip it first. I used the iZip app \u2014 also free in the App Store \u2014 but this sort of thing is generally more straightforward if you just download it on your computer.\n\nNow, when you open Delta, you\u2019ll see a plus sign in the upper-right corner. From there, you can import your games from iTunes or your files folder.\n\nTime to party!\n\nMaybe you just want to play a classic game from your youth. But don\u2019t sleep on ROM hacking communities, which have been modding retro games for decades. These developers can create professional-quality patches for your .ROM files that transport you into completely new games (but you probably want to do the patching on an actual computer). If you\u2019re bored of Pok\u00e9mon Ruby, why not try Pok\u00e9mon Emerald Rogue? Now that Delta is in the App Store, the world is your Cloyster.", "authors": "['Amanda Silberling']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pokemon-on-iphone.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "How to play Pok\u00e9mon and other Game Boy games on your iPhone", "text": "Apple finally updated its App Store guidelines to allow global developers to host retro game emulators on iOS. Now, you don\u2019t need to jailbreak your iPhone or download any sketchy software \u2014 you can get a sophisticated emulator right in the palm of your hand for free on the App Store.\n\nNo one is more vindicated by this shift in Apple\u2019s policy than Riley Testut, the developer who made GBA4iOS about a decade ago when he was in high school (when he released GBA4iOS, I showed half of my AP Statistics class how to play Pok\u00e9mon on their phones during class \u2014 sorry, Mr. Cinelli). But back then, you had to sideload the app through a loophole, and eventually, Apple caught on and ruined our fun. By fall 2014, GBA4iOS was dead. RIP.\n\nbefore emulating Pokemon on my iPhone I had to use my TI-84 like an animal pic.twitter.com/t7uMj8J5KS \u2014 Riles \ud83e\udee1 (@rileytestut) June 7, 2022\n\nSo why the change of heart now, almost 10 years later? It\u2019s probably a mixture of pressure from changing laws in the European Union, as well as increasing pressure for Apple to at least try to stop acting like a monopoly. Now, at long last, Testut has released a Game Boy emulator directly into the iOS App Store, where it has already climbed to No. 1 on the entertainment charts, as well as the free app charts generally. Delta, the emulator, even supports DS, N64, SNES and NES games, in addition to Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance games.\n\nIf you want to finally play Pok\u00e9mon on your iPhone, here\u2019s what you need to do:\n\nDownload Delta. No jailbreaking! No sideloading! It\u2019s finally just a normal app!\n\nNow, how do you get games? This is where it gets tricky. If you\u2019re a Paladin-esque rule follower, you can use a tool like Epilogue\u2019s GB Operator, which can rip .ROM files directly from the Game Boy games that you already own.\n\nBut maybe you don\u2019t have the Pok\u00e9mon Emerald cartridge that your parents bought for you when you were nine years old. While downloading an emulator like Delta is not illegal, downloading .ROM files can be considered piracy, which is not a practice that we condone.\n\nOn a completely unrelated note: You know how sometimes when you have a question, you search for related communities on Reddit that might help you answer that question?\n\nSo, now that you have legally obtained your .ROM file, how do you get it onto your phone? You can put it on Google Drive and add it to your iPhone\u2019s files folder, you can email it to yourself and download it\u2026 basically you just want to do whatever is easiest for you to get that coveted .GBA file at your fingertips.\n\nNote that only certain file types are supported by GBA4iOS. If you got your game in a .ZIP or .7Z file, you need to actually unzip it first. I used the iZip app \u2014 also free in the App Store \u2014 but this sort of thing is generally more straightforward if you just download it on your computer.\n\nNow, when you open Delta, you\u2019ll see a plus sign in the upper-right corner. From there, you can import your games from iTunes or your files folder.\n\nTime to party!\n\nMaybe you just want to play a classic game from your youth. But don\u2019t sleep on ROM hacking communities, which have been modding retro games for decades. These developers can create professional-quality patches for your .ROM files that transport you into completely new games (but you probably want to do the patching on an actual computer). If you\u2019re bored of Pok\u00e9mon Ruby, why not try Pok\u00e9mon Emerald Rogue? Now that Delta is in the App Store, the world is your Cloyster.", "authors": "['Amanda Silberling']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pokemon-on-iphone.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

On Thursday, a startup called Cape \u2014 based out of Washington, D.C., and founded by a former executive from Palantir \u2014 is announcing $61 million in funding to build what it claims will be a much more secure approach: It won\u2019t be able to leak your name, address, Social Security number or location because it never asks for these in the first place.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t leak or sell what you don\u2019t have,\u201d according to the company\u2019s website. \u201cWe ask for the minimal amount of personal information and store sensitive credentials locally on your device, not on our network. That\u2019s privacy by design.\u201d\n\nThe funding is notable in part because Cape\u2019s appeal to users is not yet proven. The company only came out of stealth four months ago, and it has yet to launch a commercial service for consumers. That\u2019s due to come in June, CEO and founder John Doyle said in an interview. It has one pilot project in operation, deploying some of its tech with the U.S. government, securing communications on Guam.\n\nThe $61 million it announced Thursday is an aggregation across three rounds: a seed and Series A of $21 million (raised when it was still in stealth mode as a company called Private Tech) and a Series B of $40 million. The latest round is being co-led by A-Star and a16z, with XYZ Ventures, ex/ante, Costanoa Ventures, Point72 Ventures, Forward Deployed VC and Karman Ventures also participating. Cape is not disclosing its valuation.\n\nDoyle attracted that investor attention in part because his past roles have included nearly nine years of working for Palantir as the head of its national security business. Prior to that, he was a special forces sergeant in the U.S. Army.\n\nThose jobs exposed him to users (like government departments) who treated the security of personal information and privacy around data usage as essential. But, more entrepreneurially, they also got him thinking about consumers.\n\nWith the big focus that data privacy and security have today in the public consciousness \u2014 typically because of the many bad-news stories we hear about data breaches, the encroaching activities of social networks and many questions about national security and digital networks \u2014 there is a clear opportunity to build tools like these for ordinary people, too, even if it feels like that might be impossible these days.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually one of the reasons I started the company,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cIt feels like the problem is too big, right? It feels like our data is already out there and all these different ways and there\u2019s really nothing to be done about it. We\u2019ve all adopted a learned helplessness around the ability to be connected, but have some sort of private, some sort of control over our own data, but that\u2019s not necessarily true.\u201d\n\nCape\u2019s first efforts will be focused on providing eSIMs to users, which Doyle said would be sold essentially on a prepaid format to avoid the data that a contract might entail. Cape on Thursday also announced a partnership with UScellular, which itself provides an MNVO covering 12 cellular networks; Doyle said that Cape is talking with other telcos, too. Initially, it\u2019s unlikely to bundle that eSIM with any mobile devices, although that also is not off the table for the future, Doyle said. Nor will the company provide encryption services around apps, voice calls and mobile data, at least not initially.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not focused on securing the content of communications. There\u2019s a whole host of app-based solutions out there, apps out there like Proton Mail and Signal, and WhatsApp and other encrypted messaging platforms that do a good job, to varying degrees, depending on who you trust for securing the contents of your communications,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are focused on your location and your identity data, in particular, as it relates to connecting to commercial cellular infrastructure, which is a related but separate set of problems.\u201d\n\nCape\u2019s not the only company in the market that is trying (or has tried, past-tense) to address privacy in the mobile sphere, but none of them has really made a mark so far. In Europe, recent efforts include the MVNO Murena, the OS maker Jolla and the hardware company Punkt. Those that have come and gone include the Privacy Phone (FreedomPop) and Blackphone (from GeeksPhone and Silent Circle).\n\nThere\u2019s already the option to buy a prepaid SIM in the U.S. anonymously, but Cape points out that this has other trade-offs and isn\u2019t as secure as what Cape is building. Although payments for this might be anonymous, a user\u2019s data is still routed through the network infrastructure of the underlying carrier, making a user\u2019s movements and usage observable. You can also still be open to SIM swap attacks and spam.\n\nFor a16z, the investment is becoming a part of the firm\u2019s \u201cAmerican Dynamism\u201d effort, which this week got a $600 million boost from the latest $7.2 billion in funds that the VC raised.\n\n\u201cCape\u2019s technology is an answer to long-standing, critical vulnerabilities in today\u2019s telecom infrastructure that impacts everything from homeland security to consumer privacy,\u201d said Katherine Boyle, general partner at a16z, in a statement. \u201cThe team is the first to apply this caliber of R&D muscle to rethinking legacy telecom networks, and are well placed to reshape the way mobile carriers think about their subscribers \u2014 as customers instead of products.\u201d", "authors": "['Ingrid Lunden']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1371533646.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/18/meta-releases-llama-3-claims-its-among-the-best-open-models-available/
{"title": "Meta releases Llama 3, claims it\u2019s among the best open models available", "text": "Meta has released the latest entry in its Llama series of open generative AI models: Llama 3. Or, more accurately, the company has debuted two models in its new Llama 3 family, with the rest to come at an unspecified future date.\n\nMeta describes the new models \u2014 Llama 3 8B, which contains 8 billion parameters, and Llama 3 70B, which contains 70 billion parameters \u2014 as a \u201cmajor leap\u201d compared to the previous-gen Llama models, Llama 2 8B and Llama 2 70B, performance-wise. (Parameters essentially define the skill of an AI model on a problem, like analyzing and generating text; higher-parameter-count models are, generally speaking, more capable than lower-parameter-count models.) In fact, Meta says that, for their respective parameter counts, Llama 3 8B and Llama 3 70B \u2014 trained on two custom-built 24,000 GPU clusters \u2014 are are among the best-performing generative AI models available today.\n\nThat\u2019s quite a claim to make. So how is Meta supporting it? Well, the company points to the Llama 3 models\u2019 scores on popular AI benchmarks like MMLU (which attempts to measure knowledge), ARC (which attempts to measure skill acquisition) and DROP (which tests a model\u2019s reasoning over chunks of text). As we\u2019ve written about before, the usefulness \u2014 and validity \u2014 of these benchmarks is up for debate. But for better or worse, they remain one of the few standardized ways by which AI players like Meta evaluate their models.\n\nLlama 3 8B bests other open models such as Mistral\u2019s Mistral 7B and Google\u2019s Gemma 7B, both of which contain 7 billion parameters, on at least nine benchmarks: MMLU, ARC, DROP, GPQA (a set of biology-, physics- and chemistry-related questions), HumanEval (a code generation test), GSM-8K (math word problems), MATH (another mathematics benchmark), AGIEval (a problem-solving test set) and BIG-Bench Hard (a commonsense reasoning evaluation).\n\nNow, Mistral 7B and Gemma 7B aren\u2019t exactly on the bleeding edge (Mistral 7B was released last September), and in a few of the benchmarks Meta cites, Llama 3 8B scores only a few percentage points higher than either. But Meta also makes the claim that the larger-parameter-count Llama 3 model, Llama 3 70B, is competitive with flagship generative AI models, including Gemini 1.5 Pro, the latest in Google\u2019s Gemini series.\n\nLlama 3 70B beats Gemini 1.5 Pro on MMLU, HumanEval and GSM-8K, and \u2014 while it doesn\u2019t rival Anthropic\u2019s most performant model, Claude 3 Opus \u2014 Llama 3 70B scores better than the second-weakest model in the Claude 3 series, Claude 3 Sonnet, on five benchmarks (MMLU, GPQA, HumanEval, GSM-8K and MATH).\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Meta also developed its own test set covering use cases ranging from coding and creative writing to reasoning to summarization, and \u2014 surprise! \u2014 Llama 3 70B came out on top against Mistral\u2019s Mistral Medium model, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3.5 and Claude Sonnet. Meta says that it gated its modeling teams from accessing the set to maintain objectivity, but obviously \u2014 given that Meta itself devised the test \u2014 the results have to be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nMore qualitatively, Meta says that users of the new Llama models should expect more \u201csteerability,\u201d a lower likelihood to refuse to answer questions, and higher accuracy on trivia questions, questions pertaining to history and STEM fields such as engineering and science and general coding recommendations. That\u2019s in part thanks to a much larger dataset: a collection of 15 trillion tokens, or a mind-boggling ~750,000,000,000 words \u2014 seven times the size of the Llama 2 training set. (In the AI field, \u201ctokens\u201d refers to subdivided bits of raw data, like the syllables \u201cfan,\u201d \u201ctas\u201d and \u201ctic\u201d in the word \u201cfantastic.\u201d)\n\nWhere did this data come from? Good question. Meta wouldn\u2019t say, revealing only that it drew from \u201cpublicly available sources,\u201d included four times more code than in the Llama 2 training dataset and that 5% of that set has non-English data (in ~30 languages) to improve performance on languages other than English. Meta also said it used synthetic data \u2014 i.e. AI-generated data \u2014 to create longer documents for the Llama 3 models to train on, a somewhat controversial approach due to the potential performance drawbacks.\n\n\u201cWhile the models we\u2019re releasing today are only fine tuned for English outputs, the increased data diversity helps the models better recognize nuances and patterns, and perform strongly across a variety of tasks,\u201d Meta writes in a blog post shared with TechCrunch.\n\nMany generative AI vendors see training data as a competitive advantage and thus keep it and info pertaining to it close to the chest. But training data details are also a potential source of IP-related lawsuits, another disincentive to reveal much. Recent reporting revealed that Meta, in its quest to maintain pace with AI rivals, at one point used copyrighted e-books for AI training despite the company\u2019s own lawyers\u2019 warnings; Meta and OpenAI are the subject of an ongoing lawsuit brought by authors including comedian Sarah Silverman over the vendors\u2019 alleged unauthorized use of copyrighted data for training.\n\nSo what about toxicity and bias, two other common problems with generative AI models (including Llama 2)? Does Llama 3 improve in those areas? Yes, claims Meta.\n\nMeta says that it developed new data-filtering pipelines to boost the quality of its model training data, and that it has updated its pair of generative AI safety suites, Llama Guard and CybersecEval, to attempt to prevent the misuse of and unwanted text generations from Llama 3 models and others.

{"title": "Meta releases Llama 3, claims it\u2019s among the best open models available", "text": "Meta has released the latest entry in its Llama series of open generative AI models: Llama 3. Or, more accurately, the company has debuted two models in its new Llama 3 family, with the rest to come at an unspecified future date.\n\nMeta describes the new models \u2014 Llama 3 8B, which contains 8 billion parameters, and Llama 3 70B, which contains 70 billion parameters \u2014 as a \u201cmajor leap\u201d compared to the previous-gen Llama models, Llama 2 8B and Llama 2 70B, performance-wise. (Parameters essentially define the skill of an AI model on a problem, like analyzing and generating text; higher-parameter-count models are, generally speaking, more capable than lower-parameter-count models.) In fact, Meta says that, for their respective parameter counts, Llama 3 8B and Llama 3 70B \u2014 trained on two custom-built 24,000 GPU clusters \u2014 are are among the best-performing generative AI models available today.\n\nThat\u2019s quite a claim to make. So how is Meta supporting it? Well, the company points to the Llama 3 models\u2019 scores on popular AI benchmarks like MMLU (which attempts to measure knowledge), ARC (which attempts to measure skill acquisition) and DROP (which tests a model\u2019s reasoning over chunks of text). As we\u2019ve written about before, the usefulness \u2014 and validity \u2014 of these benchmarks is up for debate. But for better or worse, they remain one of the few standardized ways by which AI players like Meta evaluate their models.\n\nLlama 3 8B bests other open models such as Mistral\u2019s Mistral 7B and Google\u2019s Gemma 7B, both of which contain 7 billion parameters, on at least nine benchmarks: MMLU, ARC, DROP, GPQA (a set of biology-, physics- and chemistry-related questions), HumanEval (a code generation test), GSM-8K (math word problems), MATH (another mathematics benchmark), AGIEval (a problem-solving test set) and BIG-Bench Hard (a commonsense reasoning evaluation).\n\nNow, Mistral 7B and Gemma 7B aren\u2019t exactly on the bleeding edge (Mistral 7B was released last September), and in a few of the benchmarks Meta cites, Llama 3 8B scores only a few percentage points higher than either. But Meta also makes the claim that the larger-parameter-count Llama 3 model, Llama 3 70B, is competitive with flagship generative AI models, including Gemini 1.5 Pro, the latest in Google\u2019s Gemini series.\n\nLlama 3 70B beats Gemini 1.5 Pro on MMLU, HumanEval and GSM-8K, and \u2014 while it doesn\u2019t rival Anthropic\u2019s most performant model, Claude 3 Opus \u2014 Llama 3 70B scores better than the second-weakest model in the Claude 3 series, Claude 3 Sonnet, on five benchmarks (MMLU, GPQA, HumanEval, GSM-8K and MATH).\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Meta also developed its own test set covering use cases ranging from coding and creative writing to reasoning to summarization, and \u2014 surprise! \u2014 Llama 3 70B came out on top against Mistral\u2019s Mistral Medium model, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3.5 and Claude Sonnet. Meta says that it gated its modeling teams from accessing the set to maintain objectivity, but obviously \u2014 given that Meta itself devised the test \u2014 the results have to be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nMore qualitatively, Meta says that users of the new Llama models should expect more \u201csteerability,\u201d a lower likelihood to refuse to answer questions, and higher accuracy on trivia questions, questions pertaining to history and STEM fields such as engineering and science and general coding recommendations. That\u2019s in part thanks to a much larger dataset: a collection of 15 trillion tokens, or a mind-boggling ~750,000,000,000 words \u2014 seven times the size of the Llama 2 training set. (In the AI field, \u201ctokens\u201d refers to subdivided bits of raw data, like the syllables \u201cfan,\u201d \u201ctas\u201d and \u201ctic\u201d in the word \u201cfantastic.\u201d)\n\nWhere did this data come from? Good question. Meta wouldn\u2019t say, revealing only that it drew from \u201cpublicly available sources,\u201d included four times more code than in the Llama 2 training dataset and that 5% of that set has non-English data (in ~30 languages) to improve performance on languages other than English. Meta also said it used synthetic data \u2014 i.e. AI-generated data \u2014 to create longer documents for the Llama 3 models to train on, a somewhat controversial approach due to the potential performance drawbacks.\n\n\u201cWhile the models we\u2019re releasing today are only fine tuned for English outputs, the increased data diversity helps the models better recognize nuances and patterns, and perform strongly across a variety of tasks,\u201d Meta writes in a blog post shared with TechCrunch.\n\nMany generative AI vendors see training data as a competitive advantage and thus keep it and info pertaining to it close to the chest.

The company has upgraded its AI chatbot with its newest large language model, Llama 3, and it is now running it in the search bar of its four major apps (Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp) across multiple countries. Alongside this, the company launched other new features, such as faster image generation and access to web search results.\n\nThis confirms and extends a test that TechCrunch reported on last week, when we spotted that the company had started testing Meta AI on Instagram\u2019s search bar.\n\nAdditionally, the company is also launching a new meta.ai site for users to access the chatbot.\n\nThe news underscores Meta\u2019s efforts to stake out a position as a mover and shaker amid the current hype for generative AI tools among consumers.

It is now expanding the chatbot in the English language in over a dozen countries, including Australia, Canada, Ghana, Jamaica, Malawi, New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan, Singapore, South Africa, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\n\nThe company last week started testing Meta AI in countries like India and Nigeria, but notably, India was missing from today\u2019s announcement. Meta said that it plans to keep Meta AI in test mode in the country at the moment.\n\n\u201cWe continue to learn from our users tests in India. As we do with many of our AI products and features, we test them publicly in varying phases and in a limited capacity,\u201d a company spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nNew features\n\nUsers could already ask Meta AI for writing or recipe suggestions. Now, they can also ask for web-related results powered by Google and Bing.\n\nThe company said that it is also making image generation faster. Plus, users can ask Meta AI to animate an image or turn an image into a GIF. Users can see the AI tool modifying the image in real time as they type. The company has also worked on making image quality of AI-generated photos better.\n\nAI-powered image-generation tools have been bad at spelling out words. Meta claims that its new model has also shown improvements in this area.\n\nAll AI things everywhere at once\n\nMeta is adopting the approach of having Meta AI available in as many places as it can. It is making the bot available on the search bar, in individual and group chats and even in the feed.\n\nThe company said that you can ask questions related to posts in your Facebook feed. For example, if you see a photo of the aurora borealis, you could ask Meta AI for suggestions about what is the best time to visit Iceland to see northern lights.\n\nMeta AI is already available on the Ray-Ban smart glasses, and the company said that soon it will be available on the Meta Quest headset, too.\n\nThere are downsides to having AI in so many places. Specifically, the models can \u201challucinate\u201d and make up random, often non-sensical responses, so using them across multiple platforms could end up presenting a content moderation nightmare. Earlier this week, 404 Media reported that Meta AI, chatting in a parents group, said that it had a gifted and academically challenged child who attended a particular school in New York. (Parents spotted the odd message, and Meta eventually also weighed in and removed the answer, saying that the company would continue to work on improving these systems.)\n\n\u201cWe share information within the features themselves to help people understand that AI might return inaccurate or inappropriate outputs. Since we launched, we\u2019ve constantly released updates and improvements to our models, and we\u2019re continuing to work on making them better,\u201d Meta told 404 Media.", "authors": "['Ivan Mehta']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Meta-AI-search.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

It is making the bot available on the search bar, in individual and group chats and even in the feed.\n\nThe company said that you can ask questions related to posts in your Facebook feed. For example, if you see a photo of the aurora borealis, you could ask Meta AI for suggestions about what is the best time to visit Iceland to see northern lights.\n\nMeta AI is already available on the Ray-Ban smart glasses, and the company said that soon it will be available on the Meta Quest headset, too.\n\nThere are downsides to having AI in so many places. Specifically, the models can \u201challucinate\u201d and make up random, often non-sensical responses, so using them across multiple platforms could end up presenting a content moderation nightmare. Earlier this week, 404 Media reported that Meta AI, chatting in a parents group, said that it had a gifted and academically challenged child who attended a particular school in New York. (Parents spotted the odd message, and Meta eventually also weighed in and removed the answer, saying that the company would continue to work on improving these systems.)\n\n\u201cWe share information within the features themselves to help people understand that AI might return inaccurate or inappropriate outputs. Since we launched, we\u2019ve constantly released updates and improvements to our models, and we\u2019re continuing to work on making them better,\u201d Meta told 404 Media.", "authors": "['Ivan Mehta']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Meta-AI-search.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "Uber, Nvidia-backed Serve Robotics hits public markets with $40M splash", "text": "Serve Robotics, the Uber and Nvidia-backed sidewalk robot delivery company, debuted publicly on the stock exchange Thursday, making it the latest startup to choose going public via a reverse merger as an alternative path to capital needed to fund growth.\n\nThe company, which spun out of Uber\u2019s acquisition of Postmates in 2021, hits the Nasdaq under the ticker \u201cSERV\u201d with gross proceeds of roughly $40 million \u2014 \u201cprior to deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses,\u201d per regulatory filings \u2014 at a share price of $4.\n\nServe completed its reverse merger with blank-check company Patricia Acquisition Corp. in August 2023, and at the same time secured $30 million in a round led by existing investors Uber, Nvidia and Wavemaker Partners, bringing its total amount raised at the time to $56 million. While Serve\u2019s debut in the public markets comes from a reverse merger and not a SPAC, the two alternate paths to IPO are not too dissimilar. They both provide startups with a faster route to public markets. However, pulling this particular financial lever has its risks, especially if the company is pre-revenue or bringing in very little revenue. We need look no further than the countless fallen autonomous vehicle and electric vehicle companies to determine that this is not a golden ticket to longevity or profitability.\n\nLike any publicly traded company, this path does require financial disclosures that provides information on revenue and profits or losses.\n\nServe brought in $207,545 in revenue last year, up from $107,819 in 2022, per regulatory filings. That\u2019s at a loss of $1.5 million in 2023 and $1.04 million in 2022. However, Serve Robotics said it\u2019s expecting enormous growth fueled by money generated by going public. Those funds will go toward funding R&D for future generations of robots, manufacturing activities, geographic expansion and general working capital and corporate purposes.\n\nThe startup also has some big revenue ambitions. Serve said it aims to generate between $60 million and $80 million in annual revenue, with contribution margins of over 50% and positive cash flow by the end of 2025. The company pointed to recent momentum, including its 25% month-over-month increase in deliveries since 2022 when the startup started delivering for Uber Eats.\n\nFuture growth will come from scaling the 100 robots deployed today in Los Angeles to up to 2,000 robots in multiple U.S. cities by the end of next year through a contract with Uber Eats. Serve has also enlisted Magna International as a manufacturing partner. Currently, Serve handles 300 restaurants via the Uber Eats and 7-Eleven platform in LA, but has its eyes on Dallas, San Diego and Vancouver, Canada, according to CEO Ali Kashani.\n\nServe projects that a big portion of its revenue will come from ads, Kashani told TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cI never thought that I would start a robotics company and then be in the ads business,\u201d said a tired, but excited, Kashani in a phone interview minutes before the bell rang. It\u2019s normal for companies to barely sleep before making their public debut out of a need to finalize all the financials and pure adrenaline. \u201cBut it\u2019s great because this can help offset the delivery costs, so everybody wins.\u201d\n\nKashani said Serve has had a lot of inbound interest for ads on its cute little sidewalk robots. On an annual basis, ad revenue can generate 25% to 50% of Serve\u2019s total revenue, he said.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the value propositions Serve has pitched to investors. Serve also says it can tap the rapid progress in AI and robotics to help reduce reliance on cars, because who needs something as small as a burrito delivered in a sedan anyway?\n\n\u201cThe tailwind here is that these robots are a lot more scalable than a lot of the alternative approaches we have,\u201d said Kashani. \u201cIf you look at a car, it has about 3,000 times more kinetic energy than one of our robots, so just by nature, these are safer\u2026 for pedestrians, bikers for everybody else, and I think that\u2019s definitely recognized when we talk to cities. So there\u2019s a lot of regulatory momentum, but you also have the fact that there is a shortage of labor. You can see companies in the delivery space are still not necessarily profitable, and they\u2019re looking for ways to bring some mix of automation into their fleets. So we see a lot of interest in the solution that we\u2019re providing.\u201d\n\nServe\u2019s robots operate at Level 4 autonomy, meaning they can operate autonomously within certain boundaries and conditions. However, Serve still relies on remote human operators to supervise operations in certain scenarios, like at intersections or if something unexpected happens.\n\nThe company\u2019s offering is expected to close around April 22. Serve\u2019s gross proceeds from the offering could hit about $46 million, according to Kashani, if Aegis Capital Corp., the deal\u2019s underwriter, takes the company up on its 45-day option to buy up to 150,000 additional shares of common stock, or about 15% of the number of shares sold, to cover any over-allotments.\n\nUpon the closing of the merger, Uber held a 16.6% stake and Nvidia a 14.3% stake in Serve, according to regulatory filings. An April filing shows that stake will change to 11.5% and 10.1%, respectively, once the offering closes, but a Serve spokesperson caveated that those percentages may change given the $4 opening share price.

But before that happens, owners need to understand how much pollution they are generating.\n\nElectricity alone makes up 60% of the total energy use in commercial buildings, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. There are plenty of tools out there that can convert an electric bill into estimated carbon emissions, but many are based on rough estimates. With the growth of intermittent wind and solar, knowing when you\u2019re using electricity is almost as important as how much you\u2019re using.\n\nIt\u2019s why NZero, a carbon-tracking startup, developed a new algorithm, giving building owners reports that estimate carbon pollution down to the hour.\n\nSome owners whose buildings are equipped with advanced meters and sensors already have that data, but many do not. \u201cBetter data is going to give you better outcomes,\u201d John Rula, NZero\u2019s CTO, told TechCrunch, \u201cbut it should not be a blocker.\u201d\n\nThe problem can be especially vexing for a class of real estate investment trusts, or REITs, favored by investors known as a triple net lease. The REIT is responsible for a building\u2019s emissions, but because the owner doesn\u2019t pay the utilities, it has little insight into the pollution the building generates.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re begging their customers to provide this data and with very little success,\u201d Rula said.\n\nUsing the building\u2019s address and any additional information the owner can provide, including square footage and the types of heating and cooling systems it uses, NZero can generate estimates that it says are more accurate than the owners previously had.\n\nFrom there, the company\u2019s software helps building owners identify upgrades and retrofits that will reduce emissions while also being the most cost-effective.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s all these different steps and hurdles of which data collection is one, compliance reporting is another, but they\u2019re not the end goal, right?,\u201d Rula said. \u201cThe end goal is to promote and accelerate decarbonization.\u201d", "authors": "['Tim De Chant']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1126706015.jpg?resize=1200,856", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

But before that happens, owners need to understand how much pollution they are generating.\n\nElectricity alone makes up 60% of the total energy use in commercial buildings, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. There are plenty of tools out there that can convert an electric bill into estimated carbon emissions, but many are based on rough estimates. With the growth of intermittent wind and solar, knowing when you\u2019re using electricity is almost as important as how much you\u2019re using.\n\nIt\u2019s why NZero, a carbon-tracking startup, developed a new algorithm, giving building owners reports that estimate carbon pollution down to the hour.\n\nSome owners whose buildings are equipped with advanced meters and sensors already have that data, but many do not. \u201cBetter data is going to give you better outcomes,\u201d John Rula, NZero\u2019s CTO, told TechCrunch, \u201cbut it should not be a blocker.\u201d\n\nThe problem can be especially vexing for a class of real estate investment trusts, or REITs, favored by investors known as a triple net lease. The REIT is responsible for a building\u2019s emissions, but because the owner doesn\u2019t pay the utilities, it has little insight into the pollution the building generates.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re begging their customers to provide this data and with very little success,\u201d Rula said.\n\nUsing the building\u2019s address and any additional information the owner can provide, including square footage and the types of heating and cooling systems it uses, NZero can generate estimates that it says are more accurate than the owners previously had.\n\nFrom there, the company\u2019s software helps building owners identify upgrades and retrofits that will reduce emissions while also being the most cost-effective.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s all these different steps and hurdles of which data collection is one, compliance reporting is another, but they\u2019re not the end goal, right?,\u201d Rula said. \u201cThe end goal is to promote and accelerate decarbonization.\u201d", "authors": "['Tim De Chant']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1126706015.jpg?resize=1200,856", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "Magnus Metal wants to revamp the 4,000-year-old way metal parts are made", "text": "Humans have cast metal parts in basically the same way for thousands of years: by pouring molten metal into a mold, often made of compacted sand and clay.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason this ancient method is used today: Sand casting is inexpensive and works well with both ferrous, or iron-based, and nonferrous metals. But there is a wasteful downside. The technique requires more metal than the finished part needs, and while scraps are usually recycled, melting excess metal over and over wastes energy. 3D printing has emerged as a pricey alternative generally reserved for prototypes and low-volume parts.\n\nOne startup, Magnus Metal, is working on a metal casting technology it claims is as fast and energy efficient as 3D printing at a cost that can compete with sand casting.\n\n\u201cOver time, as our reliability and utilization of the machine will rise, I think we are going to be competitive for parts that are not very simple,\u201d Magnus Metal co-founder and CEO Boaz Vinogradov told TechCrunch.\n\nFor simple pieces, sand casting will still have the advantage, but for complex parts like gearboxes, Vinogradov is confident his company can compete on cost.\n\nTo make those parts, Magnus Metal borrows elements of sand casting and 3D printing to perform what it calls digital casting. Before casting work begins, the company\u2019s software slices a design into layers. The company then takes the negative of that shape and creates ceramic forms between four to 20 mm thick, which will hold the metal in place while it cools.\n\nIn the casting machine, metal is melted and dripped into the ceramic base. Once a layer is complete, more metal is added. Each subsequent layer melts the previous one, ensuring the layers are bonded while also allowing impurities to float to the top, Vinogradov said. The melting and mixing of the layers allows its parts to have fewer defect rates and are 10% to 20% stronger than traditionally cast parts, the company said.\n\nMagnus Metal plans to sell its machines to customers as well as the proprietary ceramic that\u2019s used to produce the bases. The goal, Vinogradov added, is to generate between $500,000 to $1 million of recurring revenue per machine.\n\n\u201cIf you sell only machines, you\u2019re going to be cyclical,\u201d he said. \u201cWe produce our own ceramics, because in order to create a layer, you need ceramics that can withstand the shock of molten metal several times.\u201d\n\nMagnus Metal\u2019s layer-by-layer technique is similar to 3D printing, but Vinogradov said that his company\u2019s approach is faster, which helps lower costs.

And unlike 3D printing, which usually requires specific feedstocks, Magnus Metal said its system can use customer-specified materials.\n\nThe method doesn\u2019t require expensive tooling to create the bases, unlike molds for sand casting, according to the Magnus Metal. This means customers can make parts more cost-effectively at lower volumes relative to traditional casting, the startup says.\n\nBuilding industrial machinery like this doesn\u2019t come cheap, which is why Magnus Metal has raised a $74 million Series B, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. The round was led by Entr\u00e9e Capital and Target Global with participation by Awz Ventures, Caterpillar Ventures, Cresson Management, Deep Insight Ventures, Discount Capital, Essentia Venture Capital, Lip Ventures, Lumir Ventures, Next Gear Fund and Tal Ventures.\n\n\u201cThis [round] is going to take us into industrialization this year and beta testing beginning of next year,\u201d Vinogradov. \u201cThe goal is to use this funding to have an industrial machine that is quite robust that the customers finished testing.\u201d", "authors": "['Tim De Chant']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1503285358.jpeg?resize=1200,832", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "Trellis Climate aims to bridge the \u2018commercial valley of death\u2019 for climate tech", "text": "Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a founder who started a company that\u2019s based on a breakthrough technology that can make hydrogen cheaper and faster than anyone else \u2014 so much faster and cheaper that you sailed through your first several rounds of fundraising, bringing in tens of millions of dollars to prove it works. And it does, even better than expected.\n\nNow all you have to do is build a commercial-scale plant, a first-of-a-kind facility. Some call it the \u201ccommercial valley of death,\u201d and it\u2019s the point at which many climate tech startups struggle. Because no one has undertaken a project like that before, the usual financiers tend to balk; there are too many unknowns.\n\nClimate nonprofit Prime Coalition is hoping to bridge the valley with a new program, Trellis Climate.\n\nPrime Coalition has long taken a different tack to climate finance compared to its for-profit brethren. It makes the usual venture-style investments in startups through Azolla Ventures and also helps philanthropists direct their money to climate-related projects that it deems high impact. Trellis Climate follows the latter model with a focus on middle stages, where capital has grown scarce.\n\n\u201cThere are more and more philanthropists that are really interested in solving the climate problem,\u201d Lara Pierpoint, director of Trellis Climate, told TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cThe highest, best use of philanthropy is in trying new ideas, in really swinging for the fences on the things that have a very high impact potential,\u201d she added. \u201cIt is the most flexible and potentially risk-forward set of dollars that are out there.\u201d\n\nFor founders in climate tech, that sort of funding is likely welcome news. Early-stage founders have a wide range of capital to tap, from numerous venture capital funds to federal grants.

{"title": "Trellis Climate aims to bridge the \u2018commercial valley of death\u2019 for climate tech", "text": "Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a founder who started a company that\u2019s based on a breakthrough technology that can make hydrogen cheaper and faster than anyone else \u2014 so much faster and cheaper that you sailed through your first several rounds of fundraising, bringing in tens of millions of dollars to prove it works. And it does, even better than expected.\n\nNow all you have to do is build a commercial-scale plant, a first-of-a-kind facility. Some call it the \u201ccommercial valley of death,\u201d and it\u2019s the point at which many climate tech startups struggle. Because no one has undertaken a project like that before, the usual financiers tend to balk; there are too many unknowns.\n\nClimate nonprofit Prime Coalition is hoping to bridge the valley with a new program, Trellis Climate.\n\nPrime Coalition has long taken a different tack to climate finance compared to its for-profit brethren. It makes the usual venture-style investments in startups through Azolla Ventures and also helps philanthropists direct their money to climate-related projects that it deems high impact. Trellis Climate follows the latter model with a focus on middle stages, where capital has grown scarce.\n\n\u201cThere are more and more philanthropists that are really interested in solving the climate problem,\u201d Lara Pierpoint, director of Trellis Climate, told TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cThe highest, best use of philanthropy is in trying new ideas, in really swinging for the fences on the things that have a very high impact potential,\u201d she added. \u201cIt is the most flexible and potentially risk-forward set of dollars that are out there.\u201d\n\nFor founders in climate tech, that sort of funding is likely welcome news. Early-stage founders have a wide range of capital to tap, from numerous venture capital funds to federal grants. It might not be enough to keep the planet from warming more than 1.5\u00b0C, but so far it has been enough to prime the pump and keep climate tech investors busy.\n\nThere has been an assumption that once climate technologies have been proven, \u201cthen corporations and industry would scale those technologies,\u201d Pierpoint said. \u201cOn the corporate side, a lot of companies are really getting pushed to do the things that create immediate shareholder value.\u201d As a result, there\u2019s a widening gap in the middle.\n\n\u201cWe strongly believe that philanthropy is the catalyst, but that the goal is to bring in infrastructure investors that are willing to lean forward a little bit on risk,\u201d she said.\n\nThe program\u2019s first investments include Ample Carbon, a startup that converts old coal plants to bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, and Ebb Carbon, a marine-based carbon-removal startup.", "authors": "['Tim De Chant']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1249102033.jpg?resize=1200,800", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "Hackers Linked to Russia\u2019s Military Claim Credit for Sabotaging US Water Utilities", "text": "Russia's military intelligence unit known as Sandworm has, for the past decade, served as the Kremlin\u2019s most aggressive cyberattack force, triggering blackouts in Ukraine and releasing self-spreading, destructive code in incidents that remain some of the most disruptive hacking events in history. In recent months, however, one group of hackers linked to Sandworm has attempted a kind of digital mayhem that, in some respects, goes beyond even its predecessor: They've claimed responsibility for directly targeting the digital systems of water utilities in the United States and Poland as well as a water mill in France, flipping switches and changing software settings in an apparent effort to sabotage those countries\u2019 critical infrastructure.\n\nSince the beginning of this year, a hacktivist group known as the Cyber Army of Russia, or sometimes Cyber Army of Russia Reborn, has taken credit on at least three occasions for hacking operations that targeted US and European water and hydroelectric utilities. In each case, the hackers have posted videos to the social media platform Telegram that show screen recordings of their chaotic manipulation of so-called human-machine interfaces, software that controls physical equipment inside those target networks. The apparent victims of that hacking include multiple US water utilities in Texas, one Polish wastewater treatment plant, and, reportedly, a French water mill, which the hackers claimed was a French hydroelectric dam. It\u2019s unclear exactly how much disruption or damage the hackers may have managed against any of those facilities.\n\nA new report published today by cybersecurity firm Mandiant draws a link between that hacker group and Sandworm, which has been identified for years as Unit 74455 of Russia\u2019s GRU military intelligence agency. Mandiant found evidence that Sandworm helped create Cyber Army of Russia Reborn and tracked multiple instances when data stolen from networks that Sandworm had attacked was later leaked by the Cyber Army of Russia Reborn group.

He points out that Sandworm has never directly targeted a US network with a disruptive cyberattack\u2014only planted malware on US networks in preparation for one or, in the case of its 2017 NotPetya ransomware attack, infected US victims indirectly with self-spreading code.

{"title": "Hackers Linked to Russia\u2019s Military Claim Credit for Sabotaging US Water Utilities", "text": "Russia's military intelligence unit known as Sandworm has, for the past decade, served as the Kremlin\u2019s most aggressive cyberattack force, triggering blackouts in Ukraine and releasing self-spreading, destructive code in incidents that remain some of the most disruptive hacking events in history. In recent months, however, one group of hackers linked to Sandworm has attempted a kind of digital mayhem that, in some respects, goes beyond even its predecessor: They've claimed responsibility for directly targeting the digital systems of water utilities in the United States and Poland as well as a water mill in France, flipping switches and changing software settings in an apparent effort to sabotage those countries\u2019 critical infrastructure.\n\nSince the beginning of this year, a hacktivist group known as the Cyber Army of Russia, or sometimes Cyber Army of Russia Reborn, has taken credit on at least three occasions for hacking operations that targeted US and European water and hydroelectric utilities. In each case, the hackers have posted videos to the social media platform Telegram that show screen recordings of their chaotic manipulation of so-called human-machine interfaces, software that controls physical equipment inside those target networks. The apparent victims of that hacking include multiple US water utilities in Texas, one Polish wastewater treatment plant, and, reportedly, a French water mill, which the hackers claimed was a French hydroelectric dam. It\u2019s unclear exactly how much disruption or damage the hackers may have managed against any of those facilities.\n\nA new report published today by cybersecurity firm Mandiant draws a link between that hacker group and Sandworm, which has been identified for years as Unit 74455 of Russia\u2019s GRU military intelligence agency. Mandiant found evidence that Sandworm helped create Cyber Army of Russia Reborn and tracked multiple instances when data stolen from networks that Sandworm had attacked was later leaked by the Cyber Army of Russia Reborn group. Mandiant couldn't determine, however, whether Cyber Army of Russia Reborn is merely one of the many cover personas that Sandworm has adopted to disguise its activities over the last decade or instead a distinct group that Sandworm helped to create and collaborated with but which is now operating independently.\n\nEither way, Cyber Army of Russia Reborn\u2019s hacking has now, in some respects, become even more brazen than Sandworm itself, says John Hultquist, who leads Mandiant\u2019s threat-intelligence efforts and has tracked Sandworm\u2019s hackers for nearly a decade.

They\u2019re more outraged by employees peacefully sitting in than at how their technology is murdering people.\u201d\n\nLate Wednesday night, Google sent a company-wide email with the subject line, \u201cSerious consequences for disruptive behavior.\u201d It does not explicitly mention Israel, Gaza, or the contract name, but addresses \u201creports of protests\u201d and says that nine employees were arrested and 28 were fired.\n\n\u201cThe overwhelming majority of our employees do the right thing,\u201d the email says. \u201cIf you\u2019re one of the few who are tempted to think we\u2019re going to overlook conduct that violates our policies, think again.\u201d\n\nUpdated 4/18/2024, 10:15 am ET: Added details about a company-wide email Google sent out on Wednesday night.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast', 'Caroline Haskins', 'Andy Greenberg', 'Matt Burgess', 'Jessica Rawnsley', 'Amit Katwala', 'Kate Knibbs', 'Steven Levy', 'Morgan Meaker', 'Lauren Goode']", "top_image": "https://media.wired.com/photos/6620914325d80099fb73e496/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Google-Employees-Fired-Israel-Cloud-Project-Protest-Business-AP24107812637141.jpg", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "Zack Snyder Answers Filmmaking Questions From Twitter | Tech Support", "text": "Transcript\n\nI'm Zach Snyder.\n\nLet's answer some questions from the internet.\n\nThis is Filmmaking Support.\n\n[gentle upbeat music]\n\n@ImBaby wants to know\n\nwhy did Rebel Moon's action sequence\n\nhave so much slow motion?\n\nThe obvious answer is slow motion is awesome.\n\nThese movies are physical.\n\nThere's a physicality to what our heroes go through.\n\nThe use of slow motion to me\n\nis a way of just embellishing heroic moments\n\nthat our heroes go through.\n\nBecause I think I'm a fan of beautiful classic artwork\n\nor paintings,\n\nI like to kind of make the moments\n\ninto those iconographic frames that you can hang on and see.\n\nOtherwise, you just go right by\n\nand you'd never have a chance to appreciate\n\nthe like composition,\n\nthe sort of tension that's created by the characters\n\nand how they're pushing the frame\n\nin all the different directions.\n\nSlow motion tableau where you're moving with a character.\n\nI'm not a fan of like action that is hidden by the camera.\n\nThe camera becomes a third character in the fight\n\nwhen it's like looking for the action.\n\nIn the end, even in a sequence with a lot of editing,\n\nI tend to like to see the action unfold.\n\nConankun66 wants to know,\n\nDirector's cut? What does that mean?\n\nWhat happens is in the focus groups\n\nand in the studio screenings,\n\npeople get ideas about the movie.\n\nAnd they're like,\n\nYou know, it's too long. You've got too many shots of this.\n\nYou need to cut that out.\n\nAnd what happens is inevitably for me,\n\nthe movie will get changed based on studio opinion\n\nand things like that,\n\nand I'll be like,\n\nOkay, that's great.\n\nThis is the movie we're releasing in theaters.\n\nThere used to be a thing called DVDs\n\nand I would go over to that department\n\nand I would say,\n\nHey, would you guys be interested\n\nin an extended or director's cut of this film?\n\nYou can sell it alongside the normal version\n\nand people will maybe buy additional DVDs\n\nbased on the fact that this is never before seen.\n\nAnd inevitably DVD would be like,\n\nThat's awesome.\n\nWe can give you some money to make it as cool as you want.\n\nThe Snyder cut of Justice League\n\nis the most on steroids version of that process.\n\nThe studio finally did ask me\n\nafter pressure from the fandom\n\nto finish my version of Justice League.\n\nOne of the things that we restored\n\nwas the original aspect ratio, which was 143.\n\nIf you've seen the other version of Justice League\n\nthat I have never seen,\n\nI think it's in 185,\n\nbut for me the movie was always supposed to be 143,\n\nand I think there was gonna be a compromise\n\nif there was a theatrical wide release\n\nof my version of Justice League.\n\nI did consider 166 as possible other ratio.\n\n@GoBerserkNow wants to know,\n\nWhy did you choose 4:3 format\n\nfor your 'Justice League' cut?\n\nJustice League was originally framed to be 4:3\n\nbecause it was meant for an IMAX release.\n\nNow if you've ever been to an IMAX theater,\n\nthose screens are square.\n\nJustice League originally was composed and shot\n\nfor a square presentation\n\nbecause it was meant to be shown in IMAX.\n\nAnd so that's why when someone says, Why is it 4:3?\n\nIt is 4:3 because it was meant to be in an IMAX theater.\n\n@JoelGetty would like to know\n\nhow much of a fight scene is really up to the writer\n\nand how much is up to the director and fight choreographer?\n\nMy experience is that I like to talk with them\n\nabout what I wanna see, what I want the actress to do,\n\nwhat I want the character to achieve.\n\nI always like to break the fights\n\ninto like little mini three-act movies.\n\nIn the first act of the fight,\n\nthe main character has a lot of confidence\n\nand they're like fighting with a lot of power.\n\nIn the second act, they might make a mistake or get rocked\n\nand they lose confidence and they're now on their back foot.\n\nAnd then the third act,\n\nthey turn it around and they actually are victorious.\n\nThe way I use storyboards and action sequences,\n\nhere's the things I need to see,\n\nwanna really see Kora throw the hatchet\n\nand hit the guy in the forehead with it.\n\nAnd when she's on the guy's body, she blows his brains out\n\nbut she's holding the back of his head, boom,\n\nand he falls and then she's gonna roll and like get the gun.\n\nThose are the two beats I wanna see.\n\nAnd then they'll start linking stuff together\n\nand be like, Okay, we think if she throws the hatchet,\n\nshe's gotta fight her way back\n\nand then get the hatchet out of his head\n\nand then use it later.\n\nThat's how the collaboration works\n\nand then suddenly we have a whole fight.\n\nSo ToksTalks wants to know,\n\nWhat do you find is the best way to pitch an idea?\n\nI like to kind of set it up a little bit\n\nso that it's not a cold pitch.\n\nThis Army of the Dead idea I have,\n\nit's like a zombie heist movie,\n\nbut let me tell you more about it when I see you.\n\nAnd then how much do you have to have worked out?\n\nI think you have to have the whole thing\n\npretty much 100% worked out.\n\nI don't recommend going in without the idea figured up.\n\nI always say this,\n\nThere's one tool that you have\n\nthat everybody has and that really is your point of view.\n\nWhat I want from you is the way you see the world\n\ntranslated into a movie.\n\nSo the way you visualize a scene\n\nis the unique thing that you have that no one but you has.\n\nYou should do it from your personal perspective.\n\nTell me about the way you see and that will engage me\n\nand it will intrigue me,\n\nand I'll see something unique in your vision\n\nand then I'll write you a check for whatever,\n\na hundred million dollars.\n\n@PodcastMovement wants to know,\n\nWhat role does feedback from your audience play\n\nin shaping your creative decisions?\n\nThere's three sort of ways we do it.\n\nA trusted group\n\nwhere I would bring in like a bunch of my friends\n\nwho I like their opinion and I trust their taste,\n\nand I ask 'em a series of questions\n\nafter they watch the movie.\n\nNext is a friends and family screening.\n\nAnd so you could have 200 people at that\n\nand you show 'em the movie.\n\nI find friends and family are the hardest audience.\n\nYou'd think that friends and family would be like,\n\nOh, they're gonna be nice to the movie and say nice stuff.\n\nThey don't.\n\nThen we do a general preview\n\nwhere we go out into the theaters\n\nand we show the movie to just a general audience.\n\nYou know, you're walking by the theater\n\nand someone has a clipboard and goes,\n\nHey, do you wanna come see this movie?\n\nAnd you go and watch it and you give 'em feedback.\n\nMostly feedback from the audience\n\nis related to confusion about the story.\n\nWas it clear that that character\n\nwas the character they were referring to?\n\nOr when they went from this location to that location,\n\nwere you lost?\n\nThose are the three methods that we normally use.\n\nThe sort of online feedback, I don't really look at that.\n\nIf you actually start to look at the internet\n\nfor opinion about your work,\n\nyou can really go down the rabbit hole\n\nand that's a dark place.\n\n@ConcordLibrary wants to know,\n\nHow do you build fictional worlds?\n\nI always like to start with myth.\n\nYour words, your drawings,\n\nyour reference, your own personal taste.\n\nYou sort of set an aesthetic for the world\n\nand in setting aesthetic for the world,\n\nI'm inspired by those conversations to draw and paint.\n\nThose are the ways I start.\n\nIn Rebel Moon, we travel throughout the galaxy\n\nand we go to all these different places.\n\nNow in the script, this place is like a mining colony.\n\nWe go to a place that's like a floating dock.\n\nSo once you have these kind of,\n\nwhat I would say,\n\nthese are images that I like,\n\nthese are drawings that I've done,\n\nwe could give them to a concept painter\n\nand that painter will do a full blown painting\n\nand then I can look at it and go like,\n\nThat's exactly what I want it to look like.\n\nThose paintings,\n\nthey really end up being the sort of touchstones\n\nof each one of the looks for the environments you go to.\n\n@ZoomarPodcast wants to know,\n\nHow on earth do films get funded?\n\nWell, movies are like any business.\n\nWhoever's got the sort of resources to make a movie,\n\nand that is to say they've got a chunk of money set aside,\n\nwhen are they gonna use this money\n\nand they're gonna give it to a filmmaker to make a movie.\n\nThey say, Okay, we really wanted make a horror movie,\n\nyou know?\n\nSo they'll say, Okay,\n\ndo you have any ideas for a horror movie?\n\nBecause we, on our slate, would love a couple horror movies.\n\nAnd so you pitch them and they go,\n\nYeah, it was pretty good.\n\nI think we should at least spend some money\n\nto write a script.\n\nAnd so they pull a small amount of the money off\n\nand they go, Okay, go write your script.\n\nSo you go and you write your script and they'd come back\n\nand they read it and they go like, either, That's awesome,\n\nyou did exactly what you said, we love it.\n\nHere's more money. Go make it into a movie.\n\nOr they'll say,\n\nYou know what? Here's some notes.\n\nIt's not quite what we thought.\n\nHere's a little bit more money, can you fix it up?\n\nThe other way it happens is they go,\n\nthey have this pile of money and they have some ideas.\n\nWe bought this newspaper article\n\nand they're like,\n\nHey, writer, would you write us a script\n\nbased on this article?\n\nWhat do we do with it?\n\nLet's call some directors that we know.\n\nThey read it, they come in and say,\n\nOh, this is how I wanna make that into a movie.\n\nI see it as like black and white, low angles.\n\nYou know what? We love that.\n\nHere's money, go and make that.\n\nAnd then they would go and make it.\n\nThere's also independent films, you know,\n\nwhere like the financing is not raised from a single source.\n\nThat's mostly based on the script and a filmmaker together.\n\nSo you go to different film festivals,\n\ndifferent marketplaces,\n\nand you say like,\n\nI have an idea for a movie,\n\nRobert Downey Jr. wants to be in it\n\nand I think it could be amazing.\n\nBased on that pitch, we can give you like $5 million.\n\nI'm like, Okay, great. I'm gonna put that in my bucket.\n\nNow I go pitch it again in another room\n\nand they might have another five\n\nor European distribution or whatever.\n\nYou can also raise enough money to shoot it that way\n\nand you'd have a bunch of partners.\n\n@Capybanna wants to know,\n\nFor movies, how do directors decide\n\nwhich scenes to do in which order?\n\nThis is my basic philosophy for what order to shoot\n\nthe movie in.\n\nPage one, shot one.\n\nShoot the movie in order as best as you can.\n\nAnd so then the characters are growing or progressing\n\nalong that same timeline as the film itself.\n\nIf you're doing a super complicated fight scene,\n\nsometimes it's good to do it right off the top.\n\nWhat happens with action inevitably is takes a long time.\n\nIt requires a lot of training, choreography.\n\nThe way that happens is they spend time in the gym\n\nwith the fight team learning it.\n\nSo that requires in prep the actors\n\nbecause they're not shooting,\n\nthey have time to learn a really complicated fight.\n\nAnd when they come on the day now\n\nthey're super ready and they can do it incredibly well.\n\n@RizzolDraymon asks,\n\n@ZackSnyder, how did you get your start as a director?\n\nDid you have to do an audition or something to start off?\n\nI'm just asking 'cause I want to be a director\n\nin the future.\n\nWell, I went to a film school to be a movie director,\n\nbut about three quarters of the way\n\nthrough my college career,\n\nI was talking to the head of the department and he said,\n\nLook, to guarantee yourself a job when you get out,\n\nif you'd made a bunch of TV commercials\n\nwhile you're here in school,\n\nyou would have a reel\n\nand you could go get a job immediately.\n\nAnd when I got out of school, I went straight to work.\n\n10 years of TV commercials.\n\nA lot of the Clydesdale Budweiser commercials,\n\nfor BMW, for Subaru.\n\nI've done commercials for Bose speakers,\n\nI've done commercials for pretty much anything\n\nyou could think of.\n\nSo the way you get a TV commercial\n\nis they have a idea for a commercial storyboard\n\nand they're like,\n\nYou know what, Zach Snyder and this storyboard\n\nfeel like a good match.\n\nLet's send it to him. Get him on the phone.\n\nThey get on the phone and I go,\n\nThis is what I would do\n\nif I was directing your TV commercial.\n\nIt would be all these like super cool angles,\n\nlots of slow motion,\n\nall this cool cinematography.\n\nYour product would look amazing\n\nand people are gonna buy it.\n\nAnd so when I went to Universal Studios\n\nto audition to do the movie Dawn of the Dead,\n\nI did have a vast knowledge of filmmaking,\n\nbut I still had to do a song and dance\n\nand tell 'em how the movie would look\n\nand what would be in it\n\nand they seemed to like it.\n\n@SummitPurohit wants to know\n\nhow do filmmakers prepare themselves for the shoots?\n\nAre there people beyond the crew\n\nyou discuss the project with,\n\nyou go into isolation?\n\nDo you focus on fitness before the shoot?\n\nI'm a writer, so I'm normally writing and drawing.\n\nI have drawn the storyboards\n\nfor all the movies that I work on.\n\nAnd so I end up drawing probably about five months\n\nbefore I start shooting for Rebel Moon,\n\nthe movie I just finished.\n\nI created about 3,000 drawings.\n\nAnd as far as fitness goes,\n\nwe do really work on our fitness before the movie starts.\n\nIt does come in handy,\n\nespecially like me, I operate the camera\n\nand I was the director of photography,\n\nso I'm running around all the time.\n\nShooting a movie is a marathon\n\nand you need to be in the best shape you can\n\nbecause it's gonna wear you down.\n\n@Flwersforyou wants to know,\n\nare film directors in charge of scripts\n\nlike planning the whole movie out?\n\nOr do film directors get hired\n\nafter the movie's already completely written\n\nand planned out?\n\nThere are times, like Man of Steel, where I got a script.\n\nBeyond the words there was nothing planned.\n\nSo of course I've written half of the movies\n\nthat I've directed.\n\nWas very involved in all aspects of production,\n\nwhether it be costume design or set design, cinematography.\n\nMy last two movies, I also acted as the cinematographer.\n\nSo not only was I the director,\n\ntelling the actors what to say based on words I had written,\n\nbut I was also making shots based on drawings\n\nthat I had done.\n\n@Jon_Sandler wants to know,\n\nis meddling studio executives are always painted as villains\n\nin film books,\n\nbut I wonder how many films set executives\n\nhave to actually improved.\n\nI don't know. I've had great studio executives\n\nwho have given me amazing feedback.\n\nI just wish this.\n\nI don't know how to do it.\n\nYou're the filmmaker, maybe you have an idea.\n\nSo an answer to your question, I think probably a few.\n\nAlright, so those are all the questions for today.\n\nThanks for watching.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image": "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill,d_placeholder_wired.png,fl_progressive,g_face,h_1080,q_80,w_1920/v1713281183/wired_tech-support-blockbuster-support-zack-snyder.jpg", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

blown painting\n\nand then I can look at it and go like,\n\nThat's exactly what I want it to look like.\n\nThose paintings,\n\nthey really end up being the sort of touchstones\n\nof each one of the looks for the environments you go to.\n\n@ZoomarPodcast wants to know,\n\nHow on earth do films get funded?\n\nWell, movies are like any business.\n\nWhoever's got the sort of resources to make a movie,\n\nand that is to say they've got a chunk of money set aside,\n\nwhen are they gonna use this money\n\nand they're gonna give it to a filmmaker to make a movie.\n\nThey say, Okay, we really wanted make a horror movie,\n\nyou know?\n\nSo they'll say, Okay,\n\ndo you have any ideas for a horror movie?\n\nBecause we, on our slate, would love a couple horror movies.\n\nAnd so you pitch them and they go,\n\nYeah, it was pretty good.\n\nI think we should at least spend some money\n\nto write a script.\n\nAnd so they pull a small amount of the money off\n\nand they go, Okay, go write your script.\n\nSo you go and you write your script and they'd come back\n\nand they read it and they go like, either, That's awesome,\n\nyou did exactly what you said, we love it.\n\nHere's more money. Go make it into a movie.\n\nOr they'll say,\n\nYou know what? Here's some notes.\n\nIt's not quite what we thought.\n\nHere's a little bit more money, can you fix it up?\n\nThe other way it happens is they go,\n\nthey have this pile of money and they have some ideas.\n\nWe bought this newspaper article\n\nand they're like,\n\nHey, writer, would you write us a script\n\nbased on this article?\n\nWhat do we do with it?\n\nLet's call some directors that we know.\n\nThey read it, they come in and say,\n\nOh, this is how I wanna make that into a movie.\n\nI see it as like black and white, low angles.\n\nYou know what? We love that.\n\nHere's money, go and make that.\n\nAnd then they would go and make it.\n\nThere's also independent films, you know,\n\nwhere like the financing is not raised from a single source.\n\nThat's mostly based on the script and a filmmaker together.\n\nSo you go to different film festivals,\n\ndifferent marketplaces,\n\nand you say like,\n\nI have an idea for a movie,\n\nRobert Downey Jr. wants to be in it\n\nand I think it could be amazing.\n\nBased on that pitch, we can give you like $5 million.\n\nI'm like, Okay, great. I'm gonna put that in my bucket.\n\nNow I go pitch it again in another room\n\nand they might have another five\n\nor European distribution or whatever.\n\nYou can also raise enough money to shoot it that way\n\nand you'd have a bunch of partners.\n\n@Capybanna wants to know,\n\nFor movies, how do directors decide\n\nwhich scenes to do in which order?\n\nThis is my basic philosophy for what order to shoot\n\nthe movie in.\n\nPage one, shot one.\n\nShoot the movie in order as best as you can.\n\nAnd so then the characters are growing or progressing\n\nalong that same timeline as the film itself.\n\nIf you're doing a super complicated fight scene,\n\nsometimes it's good to do it right off the top.\n\nWhat happens with action inevitably is takes a long time.\n\nIt requires a lot of training, choreography.\n\nThe way that happens is they spend time in the gym\n\nwith the fight team learning it.\n\nSo that requires in prep the actors\n\nbecause they're not shooting,\n\nthey have time to learn a really complicated fight.\n\nAnd when they come on the day now\n\nthey're super ready and they can do it incredibly well.\n\n@RizzolDraymon asks,\n\n@ZackSnyder, how did you get your start as a director?\n\nDid you have to do an audition or something to start off?\n\nI'm just asking 'cause I want to be a director\n\nin the future.\n\nWell, I went to a film school to be a movie director,\n\nbut about three quarters of the way\n\nthrough my college career,\n\nI was talking to the head of the department and he said,\n\nLook, to guarantee yourself a job when you get out,\n\nif you'd made a bunch of TV commercials\n\nwhile you're here in school,\n\nyou would have a reel\n\nand you could go get a job immediately.\n\nAnd when I got out of school, I went straight to work.\n\n10 years of TV commercials.\n\nA lot of the Clydesdale Budweiser commercials,\n\nfor BMW, for Subaru.\n\nI've done commercials for Bose speakers,\n\nI've done commercials for pretty much anything\n\nyou could think of.\n\nSo the way you get a TV commercial\n\nis they have a idea for a commercial storyboard\n\nand they're like,\n\nYou know what, Zach Snyder and this storyboard\n\nfeel like a good match.\n\nLet's send it to him. Get him on the phone.\n\nThey get on the phone and I go,\n\nThis is what I would do\n\nif I was directing your TV commercial.\n\nIt would be all these like super cool angles,\n\nlots of slow motion,\n\nall this cool cinematography.\n\nYour product would look amazing\n\nand people are gonna buy it.\n\nAnd so when I went to Universal Studios\n\nto audition to do the movie Dawn of the Dead,\n\nI did have a vast knowledge of filmmaking,\n\nbut I still had to do a song and dance\n\nand tell 'em how the movie would look\n\nand what would be in it\n\nand they seemed to like it.\n\n@SummitPurohit wants to know\n\nhow do filmmakers prepare themselves for the shoots?\n\nAre there people beyond the crew\n\nyou discuss the project with,\n\nyou go into isolation?\n\nDo you focus on fitness before the shoot?\n\nI'm a writer, so I'm normally writing and drawing.\n\nI have drawn the storyboards\n\nfor all the movies that I work on.\n\nAnd so I end up drawing probably about five months\n\nbefore I start shooting for Rebel Moon,\n\nthe movie I just finished.\n\nI created about 3,000 drawings.\n\nAnd as far as fitness goes,\n\nwe do really work on our fitness before the movie starts.\n\nIt does come in handy,\n\nespecially like me, I operate the camera\n\nand I was the director of photography,\n\nso I'm running around all the time.\n\nShooting a movie is a marathon\n\nand you need to be in the best shape you can\n\nbecause it's gonna wear you down.\n\n@Flwersforyou wants to know,\n\nare film directors in charge of scripts\n\nlike planning the whole movie out?\n\nOr do film directors get hired\n\nafter the movie's already completely written\n\nand planned out?\n\nThere are times, like Man of Steel, where I got a script.\n\nBeyond the words there was nothing planned.\n\nSo of course I've written half of the movies\n\nthat I've directed.\n\nWas very involved in all aspects of production,\n\nwhether it be costume design or set design, cinematography.\n\nMy last two movies, I also acted as the cinematographer.\n\nSo not only was I the director,\n\ntelling the actors what to say based on words I had written,\n\nbut I was also making shots based on drawings\n\nthat I had done.\n\n@Jon_Sandler wants to know,\n\nis meddling studio executives are always painted as villains\n\nin film books,\n\nbut I wonder how many films set executives\n\nhave to actually improved.\n\nI don't know. I've had great studio executives\n\nwho have given me amazing feedback.\n\nI just wish this.\n\nI don't know how to do it.\n\nYou're the filmmaker, maybe you have an idea.\n\nSo an answer to your question, I think probably a few.\n\nAlright, so those are all the questions for today.\n\nThanks for watching.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image": "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill,d_placeholder_wired.png,fl_progressive,g_face,h_1080,q_80,w_1920/v1713281183/wired_tech-support-blockbuster-support-zack-snyder.jpg", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "Paleoanthropologist Answers Caveman Questions From Twitter | Tech Support | WIRED", "text": "Transcript\n\nI'm paleoanthropologist Steve Churchill.\n\nLet's answer some questions from the internet.\n\nThis is Caveman Support.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\n@Seanspain asks, how did caveman hunt with clubs?\n\nAnimals are really fast.\n\nWe often think of caveman as having clubs.\n\nThey probably used clubs.\n\nBut we know that by the time humans were moving\n\ninto Ice Age Europe, that they had really long spears\n\nlike six or seven feet tall.\n\nAnd we know sometimes they were tipping those spears\n\nwith stone like this to make lethal, sharp stabbing spears.\n\nEarly modern humans had real long range projectile weaponry\n\nlike bow and arrow, and in some places spear throwers.\n\nThe spear has a nock on the other end\n\nwhich fits into that hook.\n\nAnd so the spear would just be held parallel\n\nto the spear thrower,\n\nand then when you throw it, it allows you\n\nto propel the spear over a distance of about 40 meters\n\nor about 120 feet.\n\n@KarenRyden asks, I did 23 and Me.\n\nI had 89% of the Neanderthal variant of all in their system.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nYou have more Neanderthal genes than 89%\n\nof the people who've submitted their DNA.\n\nNow, most of us only have a small proportion\n\nof Neanderthal genes, only about 1% to 4%.\n\nEarly members of our species migrated out of Africa,\n\nthey met and sometimes interbred with the Neanderthals.\n\nSo if you have any ancestry from Europe\n\nor from Asia, you probably have got some Neanderthal genes.\n\nWe have complete genomes of several Neanderthals.\n\nWe're able to know, for instance,\n\nthat some Neanderthals had red hair.\n\nSo you might think,\n\nhey, if I have red hair, maybe I got that from Neanderthals.\n\nBut it actually turns out that it is a different gene\n\nthat causes the red hair in Neanderthals.\n\nSo not all redheads are descended from Neanderthals,\n\nbut because most redheads are European,\n\nmost redheads have got some Neanderthal genes in them.\n\nAt @Slugapotamus asks,\n\nyou think Ice Age is historically accurate?\n\nWell, it actually is pretty, pretty accurate.\n\nYou see in this clip here,\n\nsome animals moving past these gigantic thick ice sheets.\n\nMost of the animals that are depicted in Ice Age,\n\ngiant ground sloths, wooly mammoths, saber toothed cats,\n\nwere actually around here in North America.\n\nIn places, the ice sheets\n\nwere as much as two and a half miles thick.\n\nAnd I love the way that they depict the barren land\n\nand just dirt around the glaciers.\n\nWhen you have ice sheets like that,\n\nyou get deserts forming right up against them\n\nbecause the ice sheets suck all the moisture\n\nout of the atmosphere and create snow over the ice sheets.\n\nI think that the humans that they depict\n\nare also pretty accurate.\n\nThey're shown wearing tailored clothing.\n\nWe find bone needles in the archeological record\n\nbeginning about 30,000 years ago.\n\nAnd that indicates people were able\n\nto stitch together clothing.\n\nBut there are a couple things that are inaccurate.\n\nYou wouldn't see animals up near the ice sheets.\n\nAnimals live where the plants grow.\n\nAnd the other thing is there are no saber toothed squirrels\n\nin the fossil record.\n\n@Andydoodle56 asks, okay paleoanthropology nerds,\n\nwhat species is the Geico caveman anyway?\n\nWell, let's see.\n\nLooking at the brow ridge morphology and the really big nose\n\nand the facial architecture,\n\nit looks a lot like a Neanderthal.\n\n@StresthaAlishna asks, what happened to Neanderthals?\n\nWell, frankly, I think we did 'em in.\n\nModern humans moved into their territory, out competed them\n\nand out reproduced them.\n\nThey were short and stocky and very muscular.\n\nThey also had short limbs, short arms and short legs,\n\nso that reduced the surface area by which they lost heat.\n\nAnd they had kind of a strange architecture of the nose\n\nand face, which also helped them deal\n\nwith cold air that they were breathing.\n\nThose bodies were really good at producing heat,\n\nbut that's not good for conserving energy.\n\nThey had very costly bodies.\n\nThey were costly to move, costly to feed,\n\ncostly to keep warm.\n\nAnd so they didn't have a lot of room left over\n\nin their energy budgets to devote to reproducing.\n\nThey had a lot of competition in the form\n\nof large, fierce carnivores.\n\nThings like cave lions, cave hyenas, saber toothed cats,\n\nwolves, grizzly bears.\n\nAnd so probably for much of their history in Europe,\n\nNeanderthals were just hanging on by a thread.\n\n@roxynotlalonde asks, hey, where did early humans live?\n\nIf you look at the earliest stages of human evolution,\n\nthe first four million years is entirely here in Africa\n\nwhere we've got little ape men, the Australopiths.\n\nWe find them here in the rift valley in east Africa,\n\nin countries like Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia,\n\nand we find them in southern Africa\n\nin cave systems outside of Johannesburg.\n\nBy about two and a half million years,\n\nmembers of our own genus like Homo habilis start to crop up.\n\nAnd that includes Homo erectus.\n\nAnd Homo erectus is the first one to actually leave Africa.\n\nWe pick up Homo erectus initially in the Republic of Georgia\n\nand then eventually in Indonesia.\n\nAnd you might wonder, how did Homo erectus get to Indonesia?\n\nThose are islands out there.\n\nKeep in mind this is during the ice ages,\n\nand during glacial intervals, sea levels drop.\n\nAnd in places where there's a shallow sea,\n\nthe sea floor becomes exposed.\n\nAnd Indonesia just becomes a peninsula\n\nconnected to the southern part of Asia.\n\nAnd so Homo erectus could walk out to those islands.\n\nMeanwhile, a new species emerges.\n\nIt comes out of Homo erectus.\n\nMost of us would call it Homo heidelbergensis.\n\nIt looks like this guy right here.\n\nVery Homo erectus looking\n\nwith big brow ridges and massive face.\n\nThese guys up here in Europe gives rise to the Neanderthals.\n\nAnd in Africa, they evolve into our own species,\n\nHomo sapiens, about 300,000 years ago.\n\nAnd by about 70,000 years ago, they started expanding\n\nout of Africa.\n\nAnd they probably encountered populations of Homo erectus,\n\nwhich they knocked off.\n\nAnd by 40,000 years ago, they are moving into Europe\n\nand starting to encounter the Neanderthals\n\nwho they knock off.\n\nAnd by about 20,000 years,\n\nthey're all the way up here in eastern Siberia\n\nand they crossed the Bering Land Bridge\n\nwhere they become the Native Americans that we know today.\n\n@realityseeker asks, did cavemen have a sense of humor?\n\nThey probably did have a sense of humor.\n\nThis is a depiction of an Ibex,\n\nwhich is a kind of a wild goat.\n\nYou know, you can see its head here\n\nand its body and its legs.\n\nAnd it's got something coming out of its rear end here,\n\nwhich maybe is the first poop joke.\n\n@iamrwkali asks, how did humans survive the ice age?\n\nGosh, I can hardly bear to be outside\n\nfor more than five minutes when the temperature drops\n\nbelow zero degrees Celsius.\n\nNeanderthals had fire, sure,\n\nbut these early modern humans in Europe\n\nprobably had better pyrotechnology,\n\nhearths which channeled the airflow\n\nso they could really stoke the fire.\n\nWhen the ice ages really ramped up, they stayed put\n\nand they just hunkered down and dealt with it.\n\n@ahastyretweet asks,\n\nyou know how they discovered those fossils\n\nof three feet tall early humans in Indonesia?\n\nThey called them hobbits as a nickname,\n\nwhich is really cool,\n\nbut they really missed an opportunity\n\nto call them Neandershorts.\n\nI'm totally gonna steal that one\n\nbecause that's at the intersection of dad jokes\n\nand paleoanthropology.\n\nThe hobbits are a species of early human,\n\nand they come from a little island in Indonesia\n\ncalled Flores Island.\n\nSo the species is called Homo floresiensis.\n\nThese guys are the descendants of Homo erectus.\n\nHomo erectus got out onto Flores Island, got trapped there.\n\nWhen you get trapped on an island,\n\nif you are a small bodied mammal\n\nlike a small rodent or something, you tend to get larger.\n\nIf you're a larger bodied mammal, you tend to get smaller,\n\nwhich is called island dwarfism.\n\nAnd so these little hobbits find themselves\n\nliving in a backdrop of giant rats\n\nand tiny dwarf elephants called stegodon\n\nand being hunted by things like Komodo dragons.\n\n@Caleblama asks, honest question, did cavemen have pets?\n\nThe only domesticated animal that we had\n\nduring the stone age is the dog.\n\nThe earliest undisputed dogs in the fossil record\n\ncome from a site in Germany called Bonn-Oberkassel\n\nwhere there is a human buried with a dog.\n\nThey're used to help with hunting,\n\nthey're used to help fend off carnivores.\n\nWe don't start to see things like cattle\n\nor goats until humans settle down\n\nand start engaging in agriculture\n\nafter about 10,000 years ago.\n\n@WrldOfPaleoAnth asks,\n\nhow did the A. afarensis specimen dubbed Lucy get her name?\n\nLucy is a 3.2 million year old partial skeleton\n\nfrom Ethiopia\n\nthat represents the species Australopithecus afarensis,\n\nand she's one of the most famous fossils out there.\n\nShe was found in 1974.\n\nThe team that found her was playing the Beatles song\n\nLucy in the Sky with Diamonds incessantly in camp,\n\nand they named Lucy in honor of that song.\n\n@fifokaswiti asks, things I'm too tired to Google.\n\nWhen did hominins start having hair\n\nthat grows indefinitely long?\n\nIn a quadruped,\n\nmost of the sunshine is falling on their back\n\nand the hair protects their skin.\n\nThey don't have as much hair on the belly\n\nbecause it's shady down there.\n\nFor a biped, most of the solar radiation is falling\n\non the top of the head\n\nand the shoulders and the upper part of the back.\n\nSo Homo erectus probably retained hair\n\non the top of the head to block out solar radiation\n\nand evolved the capacity to grow it longer\n\nto protect the head, shoulders,\n\nand the upper part of the back from sunburn.\n\n@bzieg73 asks,\n\nso like, what did cavemen do about dental hygiene?\n\nWell, unfortunately, probably not much.\n\nWe do have some fossils\n\nwhich denote habitual use of toothpicks,\n\nwhere they've used toothpicks so much\n\nthat they've actually created little grooves in their teeth.\n\nBut before that, we've got guys like this guy from Africa.\n\nHe's about 250,000 years old.\n\nHe's a representative of Homo heidelbergensis.\n\nAnd he's got absolutely rotten teeth with huge cavities,\n\nprobably because he was eating a lot of honey.\n\nHe's got a hole in the side of his head here,\n\nwhich is probably from an infection\n\nfrom bacteria entering the bloodstream from these cavities\n\nand circulating around\n\nand setting up an infection in the side of his skull.\n\nAnd this is probably what killed him.\n\n@TwinZ25464257 asks, what's your favorite ancient hominid,\n\nmy paleoanthropology friends?\n\nOh, that's like asking me to pick my favorite child.\n\nI will say that these guys are one of my favorites,\n\na 250,000 year old species called Homo naledi.\n\nI was a member of a team\n\nthat found them in caves in South Africa,\n\ndown a chute which is about 40 feet long\n\nand gets down to about seven inches wide.\n\nWay too small for me to get in there.\n\nWe actually needed an entire crew of small bodied excavators\n\nto get down into this chamber.\n\nThey have an ape sized brain.\n\nThey have very primitive morphology in the face.\n\nThey're probably one of the most primitive members\n\nof our genus, but very late in time.\n\nThey're a relic species that just hung on\n\nwithout changing very much through time\n\nuntil we find them in the caves of South Africa.\n\n@Blueslicker asks, what is the missing link\n\nbetween ape and man?\n\nWell, as a paleoanthropologist, I gotta tell you,\n\nwe hate the term missing link.\n\nAnd that kind of thinking leads to conceptions\n\nof a march of progress\n\nwhere evolution is just a stepwise series\n\nof progressive changes through time.\n\nBut the human family tree was very, very bushy.\n\nThere were lots of species.\n\nWe recognize anywhere from 28 to 30 of them.\n\nAt roughly six million years ago,\n\nour lineage began to diverge from the lineage\n\nthat leads to living chimpanzees and bonobos.\n\nOur earliest ancestors would look like a chimpanzee,\n\nlike this chimp skull here.\n\nThey had very snouty faces like a chimpanzee.\n\nBut you'd be impressed by the fact\n\nthat they're walking on two legs\n\nand that their canine teeth,\n\nthis big fang here, was actually a little bit smaller.\n\nBut other than that, they're very chimpanzee-like.\n\n@ShrubPlays asks, if Gigantopithecus existed,\n\nwhy can't Bigfoot?\n\nWhy not indeed.\n\nGigantopithecus was a huge ape.\n\nIf it was standing on its hind legs,\n\nit was probably about eight feet tall,\n\nmaybe twice the size of a gorilla\n\nwith a huge head and huge teeth.\n\nThey probably lived on bamboo like panda bears.\n\nAnd they lived in Asia\n\nup until about a half million years ago.\n\nAnd some people have thought\n\nthat maybe the Yeti in the Himalayas\n\nor Bigfoot in North America are just relic populations\n\nof Gigantopithecus.\n\nThat would require that Gigantopithecus\n\ncrossed the Bering Sea into North America\n\nwithout leaving any kind of fossil record.\n\nBut maybe that happened.\n\n@PATRIC_SUN asks, bro, when did language start?\n\nIf we look at Neanderthals,\n\nthey have brains which were every bit as big as ours,\n\nand they seem to have the neural structures\n\nthat one would need to produce language.\n\nWe can tell from holes for nerves in the base of the skull\n\nthat they had very good motor control of their tongues.\n\nNeanderthals had a very long, low brain case\n\nand a more projecting face.\n\nAnd that results in a flatter base of the skull.\n\nSo Neanderthals probably could only produce\n\none or two vowel sounds.\n\nIn our species, Homo sapiens,\n\nour face is tucked up more under the brain case\n\nand we have a more globular cranial vault,\n\nand that creates a bend in the base of the brain case.\n\nWe have flexion here.\n\nThis flexion gives us a resonating space that allows us\n\nto make the full range of vowel sounds.\n\nKeep in mind that even monkeys\n\nand apes use verbal communication.\n\nThere are things like pant-hoots in chimpanzees\n\nwhich mean something to their group members.\n\nAt @7lightbringers asks,\n\nwhat the [beep] did cavemen do for fun?\n\nWell, probably not a [beep] lot to tell you the truth.\n\nWe know in the later part of the Paleolithic\n\nor the Stone Age\n\nthat they're making some musical instruments\n\nbecause we've recovered flutes made out of bird bones.\n\nPeople don't start painting on cave walls\n\nuntil modern humans are in Europe\n\ntowards the end of the ice age.\n\nWhat's really cool about these cave paintings is they often\n\ntend to make use of features\n\nand relief in the walls of the cave,\n\nsuch that if you had a fire going\n\nin the chamber of the cave,\n\nthe flickering of the fire would make these animals\n\nlook like they're moving.\n\nThese Paleolithic artists were using a lot\n\nof different pigments.\n\nSometimes it's ground ochre, which is an iron oxide,\n\nsometimes it's manganese.\n\nMaybe they're crushing up plant material like berries.\n\nAnd a lot of times we get hand prints\n\nwhere they put their hand against the cave wall.\n\nAnd then probably by chewing up some manganese or some ochre\n\nand spitting it, they're creating like a spray paint pattern\n\naround their hand.\n\n@vichalhey asks, what makes humans unique?\n\nCreativity, moral consciousness,\n\nability to reason and rationality, self-awareness?\n\nWhat's really unique about humans is the extremes\n\nto which we carry these things,\n\nthe extremes to which we become dependent on technology\n\nand language and social connections.\n\nWe know from the archeological and fossil record in Europe\n\nthat Neanderthals lived in very small social groups.\n\nThey may have only known 40 or 50 other Neanderthals.\n\nEarly modern humans seem to have extended social networks.\n\nThey seemed to be trading things over long distances.\n\nAnd so early modern humans in Europe probably knew hundreds\n\nof other early modern humans.\n\n@vnusruledx asks,\n\nthe one history question I want answered at this point is\n\nwhat is the freaking purpose behind the Venus figurines?\n\nWell, Venus figurines like this Venus of Willendorf\n\nthat you see here, some people have thought\n\nthat they're fertility figurines.\n\nBut the truth is not all of them are females.\n\nMost of them are not even human figurines.\n\nAnd probably what these things are are trade items.\n\nAs people go visiting other groups,\n\nthey're carrying them along to give as gifts.\n\n@McNidas asks, quick question,\n\nwhat did cavemen do if there were no caves in their area?\n\nIf they happen to live in an area with no caves,\n\nthey just made do with open air shelters.\n\nPrimitive tents from sticks and animal skins\n\nand use animal skins for bedding.\n\nIt's ironic that we call them cavemen\n\nbecause first off, they were usually living\n\nin rock shelters, not an actual cave.\n\nAnd when we do find them in caves,\n\nthey were always just living in the mouth of the cave.\n\n@CFA_Yin asks, so what did humans eat\n\nbefore the discovery of fire?\n\nOur ancestors were still eating a lot of vegetable material,\n\nand that meant they needed big guts\n\nbecause you gotta have a big gut to break down\n\nthat high fibrous diet.\n\nBy the time Homo erectus came along,\n\nthey're starting to cook stuff,\n\nthey're starting to mash food probably with stone tools.\n\nThis is a hand ax,\n\nabout 1.7 to 1.5 million years old from Africa.\n\nThis is probably a large scale butchery tool.\n\nAnd the great thing about fire is that it allows us\n\nto break down the food before we ingest it\n\nand we can actually get a whole lot more of the calories\n\nand nutrients out of it.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nThank you for watching Caveman Support.\n\n[upbeat music]", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image":

spear over a distance of about 40 meters\n\nor about 120 feet.\n\n@KarenRyden asks, I did 23 and Me.\n\nI had 89% of the Neanderthal variant of all in their system.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nYou have more Neanderthal genes than 89%\n\nof the people who've submitted their DNA.\n\nNow, most of us only have a small proportion\n\nof Neanderthal genes, only about 1% to 4%.\n\nEarly members of our species migrated out of Africa,\n\nthey met and sometimes interbred with the Neanderthals.\n\nSo if you have any ancestry from Europe\n\nor from Asia, you probably have got some Neanderthal genes.\n\nWe have complete genomes of several Neanderthals.\n\nWe're able to know, for instance,\n\nthat some Neanderthals had red hair.\n\nSo you might think,\n\nhey, if I have red hair, maybe I got that from Neanderthals.\n\nBut it actually turns out that it is a different gene\n\nthat causes the red hair in Neanderthals.\n\nSo not all redheads are descended from Neanderthals,\n\nbut because most redheads are European,\n\nmost redheads have got some Neanderthal genes in them.\n\nAt @Slugapotamus asks,\n\nyou think Ice Age is historically accurate?\n\nWell, it actually is pretty, pretty accurate.\n\nYou see in this clip here,\n\nsome animals moving past these gigantic thick ice sheets.\n\nMost of the animals that are depicted in Ice Age,\n\ngiant ground sloths, wooly mammoths, saber toothed cats,\n\nwere actually around here in North America.\n\nIn places, the ice sheets\n\nwere as much as two and a half miles thick.\n\nAnd I love the way that they depict the barren land\n\nand just dirt around the glaciers.\n\nWhen you have ice sheets like that,\n\nyou get deserts forming right up against them\n\nbecause the ice sheets suck all the moisture\n\nout of the atmosphere and create snow over the ice sheets.\n\nI think that the humans that they depict\n\nare also pretty accurate.\n\nThey're shown wearing tailored clothing.\n\nWe find bone needles in the archeological record\n\nbeginning about 30,000 years ago.\n\nAnd that indicates people were able\n\nto stitch together clothing.\n\nBut there are a couple things that are inaccurate.\n\nYou wouldn't see animals up near the ice sheets.\n\nAnimals live where the plants grow.\n\nAnd the other thing is there are no saber toothed squirrels\n\nin the fossil record.\n\n@Andydoodle56 asks, okay paleoanthropology nerds,\n\nwhat species is the Geico caveman anyway?\n\nWell, let's see.\n\nLooking at the brow ridge morphology and the really big nose\n\nand the facial architecture,\n\nit looks a lot like a Neanderthal.\n\n@StresthaAlishna asks, what happened to Neanderthals?\n\nWell, frankly, I think we did 'em in.\n\nModern humans moved into their territory, out competed them\n\nand out reproduced them.\n\nThey were short and stocky and very muscular.\n\nThey also had short limbs, short arms and short legs,\n\nso that reduced the surface area by which they lost heat.\n\nAnd they had kind of a strange architecture of the nose\n\nand face, which also helped them deal\n\nwith cold air that they were breathing.\n\nThose bodies were really good at producing heat,\n\nbut that's not good for conserving energy.\n\nThey had very costly bodies.\n\nThey were costly to move, costly to feed,\n\ncostly to keep warm.\n\nAnd so they didn't have a lot of room left over\n\nin their energy budgets to devote to reproducing.\n\nThey had a lot of competition in the form\n\nof large, fierce carnivores.\n\nThings like cave lions, cave hyenas, saber toothed cats,\n\nwolves, grizzly bears.\n\nAnd so probably for much of their history in Europe,\n\nNeanderthals were just hanging on by a thread.\n\n@roxynotlalonde asks, hey, where did early humans live?\n\nIf you look at the earliest stages of human evolution,\n\nthe first four million years is entirely here in Africa\n\nwhere we've got little ape men, the Australopiths.\n\nWe find them here in the rift valley in east Africa,\n\nin countries like Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia,\n\nand we find them in southern Africa\n\nin cave systems outside of Johannesburg.\n\nBy about two and a half million years,\n\nmembers of our own genus like Homo habilis start to crop up.\n\nAnd that includes Homo erectus.\n\nAnd Homo erectus is the first one to actually leave Africa.\n\nWe pick up Homo erectus initially in the Republic of Georgia\n\nand then eventually in Indonesia.\n\nAnd you might wonder, how did Homo erectus get to Indonesia?\n\nThose are islands out there.\n\nKeep in mind this is during the ice ages,\n\nand during glacial intervals, sea levels drop.\n\nAnd in places where there's a shallow sea,\n\nthe sea floor becomes exposed.\n\nAnd Indonesia just becomes a peninsula\n\nconnected to the southern part of Asia.\n\nAnd so Homo erectus could walk out to those islands.\n\nMeanwhile, a new species emerges.\n\nIt comes out of Homo erectus.\n\nMost of us would call it Homo heidelbergensis.\n\nIt looks like this guy right here.\n\nVery Homo erectus looking\n\nwith big brow ridges and massive face.\n\nThese guys up here in Europe gives rise to the Neanderthals.\n\nAnd in Africa, they evolve into our own species,\n\nHomo sapiens, about 300,000 years ago.\n\nAnd by about 70,000 years ago, they started expanding\n\nout of Africa.\n\nAnd they probably encountered populations of Homo erectus,\n\nwhich they knocked off.\n\nAnd by 40,000 years ago, they are moving into Europe\n\nand starting to encounter the Neanderthals\n\nwho they knock off.\n\nAnd by about 20,000 years,\n\nthey're all the way up here in eastern Siberia\n\nand they crossed the Bering Land Bridge\n\nwhere they become the Native Americans that we know today.\n\n@realityseeker asks, did cavemen have a sense of humor?\n\nThey probably did have a sense of humor.\n\nThis is a depiction of an Ibex,\n\nwhich is a kind of a wild goat.\n\nYou know, you can see its head here\n\nand its body and its legs.\n\nAnd it's got something coming out of its rear end here,\n\nwhich maybe is the first poop joke.\n\n@iamrwkali asks, how did humans survive the ice age?\n\nGosh, I can hardly bear to be outside\n\nfor more than five minutes when the temperature drops\n\nbelow zero degrees Celsius.\n\nNeanderthals had fire, sure,\n\nbut these early modern humans in Europe\n\nprobably had better pyrotechnology,\n\nhearths which channeled the airflow\n\nso they could really stoke the fire.\n\nWhen the ice ages really ramped up, they stayed put\n\nand they just hunkered down and dealt with it.\n\n@ahastyretweet asks,\n\nyou know how they discovered those fossils\n\nof three feet tall early humans in Indonesia?\n\nThey called them hobbits as a nickname,\n\nwhich is really cool,\n\nbut they really missed an opportunity\n\nto call them Neandershorts.\n\nI'm totally gonna steal that one\n\nbecause that's at the intersection of dad jokes\n\nand paleoanthropology.\n\nThe hobbits are a species of early human,\n\nand they come from a little island in Indonesia\n\ncalled Flores Island.\n\nSo the species is called Homo floresiensis.\n\nThese guys are the descendants of Homo erectus.\n\nHomo erectus got out onto Flores Island, got trapped there.\n\nWhen you get trapped on an island,\n\nif you are a small bodied mammal\n\nlike a small rodent or something, you tend to get larger.\n\nIf you're a larger bodied mammal, you tend to get smaller,\n\nwhich is called island dwarfism.\n\nAnd so these little hobbits find themselves\n\nliving in a backdrop of giant rats\n\nand tiny dwarf elephants called stegodon\n\nand being hunted by things like Komodo dragons.\n\n@Caleblama asks, honest question, did cavemen have pets?\n\nThe only domesticated animal that we had\n\nduring the stone age is the dog.\n\nThe earliest undisputed dogs in the fossil record\n\ncome from a site in Germany called Bonn-Oberkassel\n\nwhere there is a human buried with a dog.\n\nThey're used to help with hunting,\n\nthey're used to help fend off carnivores.\n\nWe don't start to see things like cattle\n\nor goats until humans settle down\n\nand start engaging in agriculture\n\nafter about 10,000 years ago.\n\n@WrldOfPaleoAnth asks,\n\nhow did the A. afarensis specimen dubbed Lucy get her name?\n\nLucy is a 3.2 million year old partial skeleton\n\nfrom Ethiopia\n\nthat represents the species Australopithecus afarensis,\n\nand she's one of the most famous fossils out there.\n\nShe was found in 1974.\n\nThe team that found her was playing the Beatles song\n\nLucy in the Sky with Diamonds incessantly in camp,\n\nand they named Lucy in honor of that song.\n\n@fifokaswiti asks, things I'm too tired to Google.\n\nWhen did hominins start having hair\n\nthat grows indefinitely long?\n\nIn a quadruped,\n\nmost of the sunshine is falling on their back\n\nand the hair protects their skin.\n\nThey don't have as much hair on the belly\n\nbecause it's shady down there.\n\nFor a biped, most of the solar radiation is falling\n\non the top of the head\n\nand the shoulders and the upper part of the back.\n\nSo Homo erectus probably retained hair\n\non the top of the head to block out solar radiation\n\nand evolved the capacity to grow it longer\n\nto protect the head, shoulders,\n\nand the upper part of the back from sunburn.\n\n@bzieg73 asks,\n\nso like, what did cavemen do about dental hygiene?\n\nWell, unfortunately, probably not much.\n\nWe do have some fossils\n\nwhich denote habitual use of toothpicks,\n\nwhere they've used toothpicks so much\n\nthat they've actually created little grooves in their teeth.\n\nBut before that, we've got guys like this guy from Africa.\n\nHe's about 250,000 years old.\n\nHe's a representative of Homo heidelbergensis.\n\nAnd he's got absolutely rotten teeth with huge cavities,\n\nprobably because he was eating a lot of honey.\n\nHe's got a hole in the side of his head here,\n\nwhich is probably from an infection\n\nfrom bacteria entering the bloodstream from these cavities\n\nand circulating around\n\nand setting up an infection in the side of his skull.\n\nAnd this is probably what killed him.\n\n@TwinZ25464257 asks, what's your favorite ancient hominid,\n\nmy paleoanthropology friends?\n\nOh, that's like asking me to pick my favorite child.\n\nI will say that these guys are one of my favorites,\n\na 250,000 year old species called Homo naledi.\n\nI was a member of a team\n\nthat found them in caves in South Africa,\n\ndown a chute which is about 40 feet long\n\nand gets down to about seven inches wide.\n\nWay too small for me to get in there.\n\nWe actually needed an entire crew of small bodied excavators\n\nto get down into this chamber.\n\nThey have an ape sized brain.\n\nThey have very primitive morphology in the face.\n\nThey're probably one of the most primitive members\n\nof our genus, but very late in time.\n\nThey're a relic species that just hung on\n\nwithout changing very much through time\n\nuntil we find them in the caves of South Africa.\n\n@Blueslicker asks, what is the missing link\n\nbetween ape and man?\n\nWell, as a paleoanthropologist, I gotta tell you,\n\nwe hate the term missing link.\n\nAnd that kind of thinking leads to conceptions\n\nof a march of progress\n\nwhere evolution is just a stepwise series\n\nof progressive changes through time.\n\nBut the human family tree was very, very bushy.\n\nThere were lots of species.\n\nWe recognize anywhere from 28 to 30 of them.\n\nAt roughly six million years ago,\n\nour lineage began to diverge from the lineage\n\nthat leads to living chimpanzees and bonobos.\n\nOur earliest ancestors would look like a chimpanzee,\n\nlike this chimp skull here.\n\nThey had very snouty faces like a chimpanzee.\n\nBut you'd be impressed by the fact\n\nthat they're walking on two legs\n\nand that their canine teeth,\n\nthis big fang here, was actually a little bit smaller.\n\nBut other than that, they're very chimpanzee-like.\n\n@ShrubPlays asks, if Gigantopithecus existed,\n\nwhy can't Bigfoot?\n\nWhy not indeed.\n\nGigantopithecus was a huge ape.\n\nIf it was standing on its hind legs,\n\nit was probably about eight feet tall,\n\nmaybe twice the size of a gorilla\n\nwith a huge head and huge teeth.\n\nThey probably lived on bamboo like panda bears.\n\nAnd they lived in Asia\n\nup until about a half million years ago.\n\nAnd some people have thought\n\nthat maybe the Yeti in the Himalayas\n\nor Bigfoot in North America are just relic populations\n\nof Gigantopithecus.\n\nThat would require that Gigantopithecus\n\ncrossed the Bering Sea into North America\n\nwithout leaving any kind of fossil record.\n\nBut maybe that happened.\n\n@PATRIC_SUN asks, bro, when did language start?\n\nIf we look at Neanderthals,\n\nthey have brains which were every bit as big as ours,\n\nand they seem to have the neural structures\n\nthat one would need to produce language.\n\nWe can tell from holes for nerves in the base of the skull\n\nthat they had very good motor control of their tongues.\n\nNeanderthals had a very long, low brain case\n\nand a more projecting face.\n\nAnd that results in a flatter base of the skull.\n\nSo Neanderthals probably could only produce\n\none or two vowel sounds.\n\nIn our species, Homo sapiens,\n\nour face is tucked up more under the brain case\n\nand we have a more globular cranial vault,\n\nand that creates a bend in the base of the brain case.\n\nWe have flexion here.\n\nThis flexion gives us a resonating space that allows us\n\nto make the full range of vowel sounds.\n\nKeep in mind that even monkeys\n\nand apes use verbal communication.\n\nThere are things like pant-hoots in chimpanzees\n\nwhich mean something to their group members.\n\nAt @7lightbringers asks,\n\nwhat the [beep] did cavemen do for fun?\n\nWell, probably not a [beep] lot to tell you the truth.\n\nWe know in the later part of the Paleolithic\n\nor the Stone Age\n\nthat they're making some musical instruments\n\nbecause we've recovered flutes made out of bird bones.\n\nPeople don't start painting on cave walls\n\nuntil modern humans are in Europe\n\ntowards the end of the ice age.\n\nWhat's really cool about these cave paintings is they often\n\ntend to make use of features\n\nand relief in the walls of the cave,\n\nsuch that if you had a fire going\n\nin the chamber of the cave,\n\nthe flickering of the fire would make these animals\n\nlook like they're moving.\n\nThese Paleolithic artists were using a lot\n\nof different pigments.\n\nSometimes it's ground ochre, which is an iron oxide,\n\nsometimes it's manganese.\n\nMaybe they're crushing up plant material like berries.\n\nAnd a lot of times we get hand prints\n\nwhere they put their hand against the cave wall.\n\nAnd then probably by chewing up some manganese or some ochre\n\nand spitting it, they're creating like a spray paint pattern\n\naround their hand.\n\n@vichalhey asks, what makes humans unique?\n\nCreativity, moral consciousness,\n\nability to reason and rationality, self-awareness?\n\nWhat's really unique about humans is the extremes\n\nto which we carry these things,\n\nthe extremes to which we become dependent on technology\n\nand language and social connections.\n\nWe know from the archeological and fossil record in Europe\n\nthat Neanderthals lived in very small social groups.\n\nThey may have only known 40 or 50 other Neanderthals.\n\nEarly modern humans seem to have extended social networks.\n\nThey seemed to be trading things over long distances.\n\nAnd so early modern humans in Europe probably knew hundreds\n\nof other early modern humans.\n\n@vnusruledx asks,\n\nthe one history question I want answered at this point is\n\nwhat is the freaking purpose behind the Venus figurines?\n\nWell, Venus figurines like this Venus of Willendorf\n\nthat you see here, some people have thought\n\nthat they're fertility figurines.\n\nBut the truth is not all of them are females.\n\nMost of them are not even human figurines.\n\nAnd probably what these things are are trade items.\n\nAs people go visiting other groups,\n\nthey're carrying them along to give as gifts.\n\n@McNidas asks, quick question,\n\nwhat did cavemen do if there were no caves in their area?\n\nIf they happen to live in an area with no caves,\n\nthey just made do with open air shelters.\n\nPrimitive tents from sticks and animal skins\n\nand use animal skins for bedding.\n\nIt's ironic that we call them cavemen\n\nbecause first off, they were usually living\n\nin rock shelters, not an actual cave.\n\nAnd when we do find them in caves,\n\nthey were always just living in the mouth of the cave.\n\n@CFA_Yin asks, so what did humans eat\n\nbefore the discovery of fire?\n\nOur ancestors were still eating a lot of vegetable material,\n\nand that meant they needed big guts\n\nbecause you gotta have a big gut to break down\n\nthat high fibrous diet.\n\nBy the time Homo erectus came along,\n\nthey're starting to cook stuff,\n\nthey're starting to mash food probably with stone tools.\n\nThis is a hand ax,\n\nabout 1.7 to 1.5 million years old from Africa.\n\nThis is probably a large scale butchery tool.\n\nAnd the great thing about fire is that it allows us\n\nto break down the food before we ingest it\n\nand we can actually get a whole lot more of the calories\n\nand nutrients out of it.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nThank you for watching Caveman Support.\n\n[upbeat music]", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image":

Yeah.\n\nHi, Wired.\n\nWe are the cast of Fallout,\n\nand we are answering the most-Googled questions\n\nabout Fallout.\n\n[Walton] Okay, here we go.\n\n[percussive music]\n\n[modem screeching]\n\nWhen did the bombs drop in Fallout?\n\nOoh. Wow.\n\n2077.\n\nI think we all know. 2077.\n\nWe know this one. 2077. [bell dings]\n\n2077. That's easy.\n\nGot that one.\n\nDid you just throw that on the ground?\n\nThat's what we do. Yeah.\n\nHow many vaults are in Fallout?\n\nDo you know the,\n\ndo you know the answer to this one?\n\nHow many vaults in Fallout?\n\nHow many vaults are in Fallout?\n\nWell, you're in Vault-\n\nHow do you know?\n\n33? There's at least 33.\n\n[Aaron laughs]\n\nThere's at least 33.\n\nThere's at least 33.\n\nOkay. There's 33 that we know of.\n\nMm.\n\nWe're actors.\n\nWe're not writers.\n\nI think it's 122. 122? You think so?\n\nI think it's 122. [bell dings]\n\nWow. That's a lot.\n\nI don't know my lines, but I know that.\n\nYeah. Perfect.\n\nIs Fallout TV show canon?\n\nIt's a story within the Fallout universe\n\nthat fits in the canon\n\nof Fallout, [bell dings]\n\nbut it's not based\n\nor predicated\n\non one of the Fallout games.\n\nThat was good. Yeah.\n\nWas that good? Yeah.\n\nOkay. Great.\n\nThere we go.\n\nMy turn.\n\nThank you so much,\n\nby the way, for making these words so big,\n\n[Ella laughs]\n\nbecause I usually need glasses.\n\nHow big would a real life Vault-Tec vault\n\nfrom the Fallout universe be?\n\nOoh, great question.\n\nI didn't know that one.\n\nHow big would a real life Vault-Tec vault be?\n\nWait, how many people live in a vault?\n\nUh, you know- A lot.\n\nI mean, there are- At least 33.\n\nThere are numbered streets.\n\nThere's a High Street. [Ella and Aaron laugh]\n\nRight?\n\nYou got a couple of neighborhoods, right?\n\nI mean, it supports about- It's a little town.\n\nLike 300,\n\n300 people?\n\n300, 300, 400.\n\nYeah, 300, 400 people?\n\nSo let's go with, like,\n\nthe size of, like, an Amazon warehouse.\n\n[Ella laughs]\n\n[all laughing]\n\nI don't know. I'm gonna go, like-\n\nI think that's right.\n\nLet's go 50,000 square feet.\n\nYeah, 50,000 square feet.\n\n100,000 square feet. [bell dings]\n\n[Aaron] What is that in square meters?\n\nYeah. I don't know.\n\nI live in America. [Ella laughs]\n\nWho are the good guys in Fallout?\n\nI mean, depends who you ask.\n\nVillains- That's probably right.\n\nBecome heroes that become villains\n\nand then heroes again.\n\nJust a lot of gray area.\n\nIt's a lot of gray area.\n\nWho are the actors in the Fallout TV show?\n\n[Ella laughs]\n\n[Aaron vocalizing]\n\nThis is us. [all laughing]\n\nWe did it. We-\n\nNext.\n\nI play Maximus.\n\nHe's Aaron Moten. What?\n\nI'm Ella Purnell. I play Lucy.\n\nI'm Walton Goggins,\n\nand I play The Ghoul.\n\nHow about that?\n\nThe Irradiated Ghoul.\n\nWhy does Lucy leave the vault?\n\n[Ella inhales deeply]\n\nUm... To get,\n\nto get food?\n\nTo get the other side.\n\nI'm just kidding.\n\n[all laughing] To get to the other side.\n\nShe has a mission\n\nthat she has to complete somewhere else.\n\nWhat's the mission?\n\nI can't say.\n\n[Walton and Aaron laugh]\n\nBam.\n\nI don't wanna get sued. Just like that,\n\nOut. Out. Next one. Don't sue me, Amazon.\n\nAre Fallout ghouls immortal?\n\nWow. Wow.\n\nYou know, I don't know the answer to that,\n\nto that question.\n\nI know that I've lived for 200 years.\n\nIt's a very long time.\n\nBut you can die.\n\nI think yeah.\n\nI think, yeah, you can die.\n\nYeah, ghouls die.\n\nYeah, the ghouls die all the time.\n\n[bell dings] All the time?\n\n[Ella] Yeah. Yeah. It's tragic.\n\nThis one, this one just hasn't, yet.\n\nIt's in my contract.\n\n[Aaron laughs]\n\nWe'll see if he lives to 205 years.\n\n[Aaron and Walton laugh]\n\nWhat is Mr. Handy in Fallout?\n\nAm I right in thinking that's the robot?\n\n[bell dings]\n\nYou know, he's a pretty cool robot, too.\n\nHe is, actually. Yeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nHe's one of the first characters you meet in the game.\n\nWell, in Fallout 4, the game that I played.\n\nAnd it's a really good intro to Fallout.\n\nYeah.\n\nToss it. Oh.\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nWhat am I thinking? Get it outta here.\n\nIs Maximus in the Brotherhood of Steel?\n\nYes. [bell dings]\n\nYeah. We're getting through these.\n\n[Walton] Simple.\n\nDoes the internet exist in the Fallout universe?\n\nNo. [buzzer buzzing]\n\nI don't think so.\n\nNo. No.\n\nI don't think so.\n\nGood luck. No.\n\nIs Wasteland in the Fallout universe?\n\nYeah.\n\nWasteland is in the Fallout universe.\n\n[bell dings]\n\nIt's a very, very big part\n\nof the Fallout universe.\n\nAnd the Wasteland, as far as we know it,\n\nI mean, we're,\n\nthe first season takes place in Los Angeles.\n\nWe can say that.\n\nBut it could be all over the world.\n\nProbably is all over the world.\n\nOh.\n\nAnd we will explore the entire world\n\nin the 10 seasons that we do this show.\n\n[Ella laughs]\n\nWow.\n\nSo thank you very much for watching it.\n\n[Ella laughs]\n\nWho is the dog in Fallout?\n\nIn the game,\n\nit's Dogmeat.\n\nDogmeat. Dogmeat.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nIn the show, he- CX-\n\nHe is CX404. [bell dings]\n\nCX, CX404.\n\nNailed it.\n\nYeah. Got that one.\n\nCan I just take a second?\n\n[Aaron] Yeah, why?\n\nWe've answered a lot of these questions correctly.\n\nYeah, we have. Yeah.\n\nWe're doing pretty good here.\n\nIs there a score? It's not bad.\n\nNo. But there should be a score.\n\nWe're against all of you-\n\nWe're a very competitive cast.\n\nWatching at home, and we're winning.\n\nWe like everything to be a competition.\n\nWe're winning.\n\nIs Fallout TV show based in California?\n\nIt is. [bell dings]\n\n[Aaron] Yes.\n\nYeah.\n\nOh, this is a hard one.\n\nWhat creature would be the most dangerous\n\nin the Fallout universe?\n\nThis one, probably.\n\nRight here.\n\nOoh. I'm a creature.\n\n[Ella laughs]\n\nI'm a reptile.\n\nThere's a lot of,\n\nI mean, in Fallout the game-\n\nThe show is different, right? But-\n\nThe gulpers. The gulper is one.\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nWhat about your guy? Yeah.\n\nA yao guai's, yeah,\n\nthat's pretty formidable.\n\nYou know, Dogmeat- What about your guy?\n\nDogmeat's pretty formidable. Yeah.\n\nYou know, like, let's just- That's right.\n\nJust a basic Belgian Malinois.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nHe's, that's pretty dangerous.\n\nOh, we forgot about the Deathclaw.\n\n[bell dings]\n\nWe forgot about the Deathclaw.\n\nThe Deathclaw is,\n\ncan invoke death.\n\n[all laughing]\n\nOoh.\n\nOh. Can Fallout ghouls reproduce?\n\nWow. Uh- [Ella laughs]\n\nNot ready for primetime on this one.\n\nThat's you.\n\nYou know, I- Highly-Googled.\n\nHighly-Googled.

That's what it is.\n\n219.\n\nSo that would make it\n\n2277\n\nplus 19\n\nwould be 97 minus one.\n\nThat's how I do math.\n\n[Aaron laughs]\n\nWait, like- So\n\n2, 2,\n\n2296. [bell dings]\n\n2296.\n\nWho plays The Ghoul in Fallout TV show?\n\nAaron Moten.

[bell dings]\n\nIt's retro-futuristic\n\nand nostalgic.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou know, it's cool.\n\nAre there any female ghouls in Fallout?\n\nOoh.\n\nYou would know the answer to this question.\n\nThere are female ghouls. [bell dings]\n\nYeah, they do- Yeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah. They exist.\n\nAre there-\n\nWhy is this one of the most cuckoo questions?\n\nAre there any horses in the Fallout universe?\n\nThis is just me Googling this.\n\n[Ella laughs]\n\nSo frequently.\n\nI- I haven't seen any,\n\nand I would love to see a two-headed,\n\nthree-headed horse.\n\nI don't know.\n\nIt would be mutated.\n\nIt wouldn't look like a horse.\n\nNo. No.\n\nI mean, I...\n\nIf, you know, The Ghoul's been around\n\nfor 200 years-\n\nWouldn't you have you seen it?\n\nYou would think that he would have picked a horse\n\ninstead of walking.\n\n[Ella and Aaron laugh]\n\nIt's a lonely Wasteland.\n\nI don't know that there are horses.\n\n[bell dings] I'm gonna say no.\n\nI'm gonna say no.\n\nI don't,\n\nI'm not, I don't know,\n\nbut I'm gonna disagree. Yeah.\n\nOh, what's the armor in the Fallout TV show?\n\nWe have a few models,\n\nbut our main model\n\nis a T-60 Power Armor suit. [bell dings]\n\nWow. Did you,\n\ndid it make you feel,\n\nwas it, was it-\n\nOf course.\n\nYou put any part of that armor on\n\nand people move out of your way.\n\n[Walton] Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nThat's cool.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nOh, man. I would love to-\n\nI want one.

[bell dings]\n\nThey're,\n\nthey're huge catfish. Right.\n\nThey're really, really big catfish.\n\nBut they're-\n\nBut blended with... Really messed up.\n\nBlended with... Blended with-\n\nThey're kind of buff, though.\n\nYeah. They're buff.\n\nLike, they're buff.\n\nThey're kind of blended with humans, right?\n\nThey have arms. They're like people.\n\nYeah. They're weird.\n\nThey're weird.\n\nThere's someone out there that thinks gulpers are hot.\n\nI'm just putting that out there.\n\nUgh. [Walton laughs]\n\nHow to become a ghoul in Fallout?\n\nWell, you gotta have a great agent.\n\n[Ella and Aaron laugh]\n\nYou know, for me it's CAA.\n\nYou know,\n\nit's through radiation. [bell dings]\n\nSo everyone kind of has that potential,\n\nor fate, I suppose,\n\nif you live long enough\n\nliving in a radioactive world\n\nor an irr-\n\nirrid-\n\nirrid-\n\n[Ella laughing] Irradiated world.\n\nIrradiated world. There we go.\n\n[Ella laughing]\n\nThat you can kind of become a ghoul.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou, too, can become a ghoul.\n\nIt takes about three hours in the chair every morning.\n\nIf you just believe in yourself.\n\n[all laughing]\n\nWas Bethesda involved\n\nin Fallout TV show?\n\nTodd Howard and Jonah Nolan\n\nare the whole conversation\n\nthat started the entire process of creating\n\nour show of Fallout. [bell dings]\n\nBethesda is very much involved,\n\nand I think they're really happy with this show.\n\nOh, do you? I do.\n\nOh, do you?\n\nDo you think that we will get\n\nother Bethesda games for free?\n\nOoh. We should ask them. Like some swag?\n\nYou know, like a couple of things?\n\nI want some Bethesda swag.\n\nHint, hint.\n\n[Walton laughs]\n\nHow many questions- [Aaron and Ella laughing]\n\nWhat are you guys doing?\n\nIs this deck of cards,\n\nit's a deck of cards. Come on, guys.\n\nHow realistically do you think the Fallout universe\n\nportrays a post-apocalyptic world?\n\nI'd like to, like,\n\nhave dinner with the person\n\nthat actually Googled this.\n\nThis is a very serious- It's a big question.\n\nI like it.\n\nQuestion, really, yeah.\n\nWell, I think it depends\n\non what caused the apocalypse, right?\n\nThis is very specifically a nuclear apocalypse.\n\nYeah. That's right.\n\nVery specifically,\n\nwhat makes Fallout\n\nis the two-headed cows\n\nand the retro-futuristic vibe\n\nand, you know.\n\nAnd the reorganization of people, you know.\n\nYeah. The clan formations-\n\nRight. That happen.\n\nThere's some things that I think are extremely realistic.\n\n[Ella] Very realistic.\n\nWell, and I,\n\nI think it bears kind of repeating, like,\n\nbecause it's a serious question.\n\nSo many of the locations that we went to photograph\n\nin Namibia were real.\n\nYes. Right?\n\nSo, so much of it is not green screen.\n\nAnd so it feels very tactile and real.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nOoh, that's for you.\n\nIs the Brotherhood of Steel evil?\n\nAnother big question.\n\nVery big question. Boy.\n\nWell, I believe the Brotherhood of Steel\n\nbelieves that everything they're doing is right and just,\n\nand that they are the good guys.\n\nYou take the last one.\n\nOh.\n\nCan ghouls turn feral?\n\nThe answer is absolutely. [bell dings]\n\nI haven't, yet.\n\nLucky, I suppose.\n\nBut there are a lot of feral ghouls in the show.\n\nIt's pretty, it's pretty gnarly, huh?\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nIt's rough.\n\nYou experienced them.\n\nYeah. It's rough.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nYou do not wanna get on the wrong side of a feral ghoul.\n\nI think feral ghouls give all ghouls a bad name.\n\nI agree with you.\n\nI absolutely agree with you.\n\nFeral ghouls give good ghouls-\n\nIt's hard out here for a ghoul.\n\nA bad name. [Aaron laughs]\n\nIt's hard to be a ghoul.\n\nHot out here for a ghoul.\n\n[Walton and Aaron laugh]\n\nAnd with that,\n\nI thank you.\n\nThank you for having us.\n\nThat was some of the most-Googled questions\n\nabout Fallout.\n\n[modem screeching]", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image": "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill,d_placeholder_wired.png,fl_progressive,g_face,h_1080,q_80,w_1920/v1712758358/wired_wired-s-50-most-searched-questions-wi-50-most-googled-fallout.jpg", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

Nope.\n\n[both giggle]\n\nWhen did Camila Mendes [cardboard tears] start acting?\n\nI did a lot of theater as a kid, in school and stuff,\n\nbut I didn't start acting professionally,\n\nuntil, like the end of my senior year of college.\n\nI booked an Ikea commercial,\n\nand then shortly after I booked Riverdale.\n\nSo, that was kind of like my first big job.\n\nWho is Camilla Mendes' best friend?\n\nI have a few. I would hate to just reduce it to one.\n\nRachel Matthews, of course, she's my producing partner.\n\nFrancesca Reale, who's in this movie.\n\nShe's in this movie. She's fantastic.\n\nWho plays Hailey. Kiara Moreno, who's a childhood friend.\n\nAnd, Rudy Mancuso.\n\nAh. Who do you know?

I love puppets.\n\nRudy Mancuso [cardboard tears] and Camilla Mendes movie.\n\nVery appropriate.\n\nWe we're almost gonna title the movie that, but,\n\nAmazon didn't approve, for some reason.\n\nThey passed, they passed.\n\nWhy is it called Musica?\n\nFilms is from the perspective\n\nof somebody with synesthesia, played by me, based on me,\n\nwho sees the world, and organizes sounds in their world,\n\nmusically.\n\nThe film also deals heavily with Brazilian culture,\n\nand the Portuguese language.\n\nFor that reason, we chose to title the film.\n\nIn Portuguese In Portuguese.\n\nThe Brazilian word for music, obviously.\n\nRudy Mancuso [cardboard tears] Albert Desmond.\n\nWho's Albert Desmond?\n\nAlbert Desmond is the character\n\nthat I played in The Flash.\n\nOh, right, duh.\n\nI knew that.

I would hate to just reduce it to one.\n\nRachel Matthews, of course, she's my producing partner.\n\nFrancesca Reale, who's in this movie.\n\nShe's in this movie. She's fantastic.\n\nWho plays Hailey. Kiara Moreno, who's a childhood friend.\n\nAnd, Rudy Mancuso.\n\nAh. Who do you know? You could have just said that.\n\nAnd, saved the heartache.\n\n[giggles] What's [cardboard tears]\n\nnew with Camila Mendes? [laughs]\n\nWhat's new, Kid?\n\nI don't know what's new with you?\n\nI got a movie coming out, it's called Musica.\n\nIt's very, very good.\n\nDirected by this guy,\n\nand written by this guy,\n\nand composed by this guy.\n\nAnd, I also executive produced it.\n\n[cardboard clatters]\n\nIt's me again.\n\nRudy Mancuso [cardboard tears] Awkward Puppets.\n\nAwkward Puppets is, like, a sub-brand.\n\nIt's a different channel,\n\nand it's quite literally a troop of puppets\n\nthat make strange jokes.\n\nNamely Diego is, like, the Elmo of the crew.\n\nAnd, this started while I was in college,\n\njust that idea of doing like an awkward, humanized,\n\nadult puppet show, which is a strange dream to have,\n\nbut still exists today.\n\nYou like puppets, right? I love puppets.\n\nRudy Mancuso [cardboard tears] and Camilla Mendes movie.\n\nVery appropriate.\n\nWe we're almost gonna title the movie that, but,\n\nAmazon didn't approve, for some reason.\n\nThey passed, they passed.\n\nWhy is it called Musica?\n\nFilms is from the perspective\n\nof somebody with synesthesia, played by me, based on me,\n\nwho sees the world, and organizes sounds in their world,\n\nmusically.\n\nThe film also deals heavily with Brazilian culture,\n\nand the Portuguese language.\n\nFor that reason, we chose to title the film.\n\nIn Portuguese In Portuguese.\n\nThe Brazilian word for music, obviously.\n\nRudy Mancuso [cardboard tears] Albert Desmond.\n\nWho's Albert Desmond?\n\nAlbert Desmond is the character\n\nthat I played in The Flash.\n\nOh, right, duh.\n\nI knew that. Yeah.\n\nThat was fun. I love you in that role.\n\nYou do? Yeah. It's really funny.\n\nYou play a good nerd.\n\nIt's kind of like a version of myself.\n\nYeah.\n\nI just play myself in everything.\n\nI'm not a very good actor.\n\n[laughs] Yes, you are.\n\nRudy Mancuso, Justin Bieber.\n\nThere's a long history there.\n\nOne of my first close friends when I moved to Los Angeles,\n\nfriend and collaborator,\n\nand he also gave me the opportunity to open for him\n\nduring his Purpose World Tour,\n\nwhich was a life experience that I'll never forget.\n\nShout out to JB.\n\nWould've loved to see that. Well, you met him recently.\n\nI didn't know you then. I did meet him recently.\n\nYou met him and Hailey at the white party, right?\n\nMhm.\n\nWho's Brazilian? Who is half Brazilian.\n\nDone!\n\nWell. Well that's all, folks.\n\nThat's all. [both laugh]\n\nThat's all we got.\n\nThose are all our. Our responses\n\nto your Google searches. Yeah.

Modular?\n\nModular housing can also be referred to as prefab.\n\nDifferent components will be manufactured\n\nin different manufacturing sites.\n\nThey're all brought back to the site\n\nand assembled kind of like a jigsaw puzzle.\n\nThe manufacturing can take place where labor is cheaper,\n\nand it also doesn't disturb the neighborhood as much.\n\nAnother new-ish building technology\n\nthat I'm really excited about\n\nis something called mass timber,\n\nwhere wood is laminated together with a special glue\n\nto create really large beams of wood that are very strong.\n\nThey're also fire resistant.\n\nThey have a lower carbon footprint as well.\n\nMass timber is now becoming stronger,\n\nand so it can be used to build higher and higher buildings.\n\nPrevious to a couple of years ago,\n\nthe highest building you could build in the United States\n\nout of timber was six stories.\n\nNow, you can build 18 stories.\n\nSo we're going to start seeing high rises\n\nbuilt entirely of wood.\n\nIt's pretty amazing.\n\n@ReadLyte says, It will be interesting to see\n\nhow the value of oceanfront property changes\n\nas sea levels continue to rise.\n\nThis will be really interesting.\n\nSo far, though it really hasn't affected home prices.\n\n@Shmoawkjg asks, What is redlining?\n\nIt's kind of come to signify any sort\n\nof racial discrimination in housing,\n\nbut actually there's a really specific\n\nhistory around redlining.\n\nThis is a redlining map from Cleveland.\n\nIn the 1930s, the United States federal government\n\ndecided to start a new mortgage program\n\nto allow home buyers to access federally backed mortgages.\n\nThe government created these maps to determine\n\nwhere their investments would be safe.\n\nGreen areas, where you see down here,\n\nit's where the federal government felt\n\nthat their money would be well used.\n\nThey also created a D class or a red class,\n\nwhich was really a no-go zone,\n\nwhere the federal government did not want\n\nto provide government backed mortgages.\n\nThese redlined areas are where black families lived.\n\nIt made it very difficult\n\nfor residents living in these areas,\n\npredominantly black residents, to access mortgages.\n\nMany of these maps exist\n\nfor communities all across the United States.\n\nThese maps were not made public\n\nuntil 1978 when a historian stumbled upon them.\n\nIf you look at the neighborhoods\n\nthat were historically redlined,\n\nthese are still some\n\nof the most racially segregated neighborhoods\n\nacross the United States,\n\nand those effects are still felt today.\n\nMany of the historically redlined neighborhoods\n\nhave experienced disinvestment,\n\nand more recently,\n\nmany of them have become targets for gentrification,\n\ndisplacing many of these residents as well.\n\n@DonGhotti says, Is gentrification all bad?\n\nPretty much.\n\nThere's something called direct displacement.\n\nPeople are directly displaced from their homes\n\nbecause they can no longer afford the higher rents.\n\nSomething else happens as well\n\nthat's called indirect displacement.\n\nThe shops are different.\n\nThe community members are different.\n\nAnd so this is kind of making you feel uncomfortable\n\nin your own neighborhood.\n\nBoth of these things are bad.\n\nI think a lot of people think about gentrification\n\nassociated with these kind of design choices\n\nthat hipsters make.\n\nSo you think of the Helvetica house numbers\n\nor sometimes the gentrification fences around homes.\n\nReally, these are kind of an effect of gentrification.\n\nThey're not causing gentrification.\n\nGentrification is really caused\n\nby institutional investment in lower income neighborhoods.\n\nInvestors are coming in\n\nand recognizing what's called a rent gap,\n\nthe gap between the current rents\n\nthat are charged in low income area\n\nand the potential to charge higher rents.\n\nThese neighborhoods might be really centrally located,\n\nmight be near transit,\n\nand so investors see an opportunity to buy up\n\nand improve buildings\n\nand then take advantage of that gap\n\nby charging higher rents.\n\n@Burns12Regina says,\n\nI'm confused as to how exactly\n\nare Airbnbs affecting the housing market.\n\nA lot of rentals that would have been provided\n\nfor permanent residents have transitioned to Airbnb housing,\n\nwhich means it reduces the amount\n\nof total rentals available on the market\n\nand drives prices up.\n\nFor example, we can look to London.\n\nIt is the city with the largest number\n\nof Airbnbs in the entire world.\n\n50,000 Airbnb units were previously long-term\n\nrental units in London.\n\nThat means that 50,000 rental apartments\n\nwere taken off the market\n\nand are no longer available to permanent residents.\n\nAlso, some research has shown\n\nthat Airbnb's increasing\n\nactually contributes to gentrification\n\nand raising home prices in certain neighborhoods.\n\n@scottyzs_ says,\n\nHow the [beeping] did my parents buy a house\n\nat 26 years old while I have $2,000 in my bank account?\n\nI feel your pain, scottyzs_.\n\nReally, things are much different\n\nfor millennials than they were for boomers.\n\nWhen boomers were reaching the age to buy a home\n\naround the late 80s, early 90s.\n\nIf you made about $50,000 a year,\n\nthe average home at that point was about $121,000.\n\nSo that's really only about a two times\n\nincrease from your income.\n\nThere is a little bit of a dip here\n\nfollowing the 2008 recession,\n\nbut it increased dramatically since.\n\nThe median home price increased by 43%,\n\nwhere the median income only increased by 7%.\n\nThe average right now in the United States\n\nis a home price that is about six times the median income.\n\nIf you think about very expensive places\n\nlike the California coast or New York City,\n\nthat can be about 11 times the median income.\n\n@kevinvdahlgren asks,\n\nWhat is the leading cause of homelessness?\n\nThere are a lot of common misconceptions\n\naround people who are unhoused,\n\nthat perhaps drug use is involved,\n\nthat there are mental illnesses,\n\nand these things do exist,\n\nbut they are not the drivers of homelessness.\n\nRecent research from the University\n\nof California San Francisco actually found\n\nthat the leading cause of homelessness\n\nis a lack of access to affordable housing.\n\nIt's very easy to lose your home.\n\n8.5 million Americans right now are at risk\n\nof becoming homeless because rents are so high\n\nand incomes are so low.\n\nAny increase in rent\n\nor perhaps a medical emergency could be the difference\n\nbetween someone remaining in their home\n\nand becoming unhoused.\n\n@Nosemanoo says, Why are there so many homeless\n\nin Los Angeles?\n\nThere's a common myth that\n\nthere are a lot of unhoused people in Los Angeles\n\nbecause they move there for access to the good weather.\n\nThis is really not true.\n\nResearchers have found that the vast majority\n\nof people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles\n\nare from California,\n\nand even from that specific county,\n\nthat they previously had housing in that area\n\nand were then priced out of it and became unhoused.\n\nCalifornia, as you can see here,\n\nhas the most number of unhoused people\n\nof any state across the country.\n\nThis number has increased 40% since 2007.\n\nNew York also has a very high number\n\nof about 103,000 people.\n\nThere are differences though.\n\nMost of the unhoused people in California are unsheltered.\n\nThis means they don't have access\n\nto temporary shelter facilities.\n\nIn New York, the majority of those people are sheltered.\n\nThat's a result of a policy in New York City\n\ncalled Right to Shelter.\n\nNew York City is the only city in the country\n\nthat mandates the city to provide a shelter bed\n\nto every single person who requests it.\n\n@dawnjay_ says,\n\nWhy are corporations buying up houses just to rent them?\n\nWhy should any house be owned by [bleeping] Walmart?\n\nI don't know about Walmart,\n\nbut corporations are certainly buying up houses.\n\nThere was a lot of internet speculation\n\nabout a company called BlackRock,\n\nwhich is a private equity firm,\n\nbuying up single family homes and renting them out.\n\nThis isn't really happening.\n\nHowever, BlackRock is investing\n\nin real estate investment trusts that are investing\n\nin apartment building acquisitions and rentals.\n\nSo BlackRock isn't buying up suburban homes,\n\nbut they are investing in the rental market,\n\nand so corporations are recognizing real estate\n\nas an asset class that they would like to invest in,\n\njust like stocks and bonds.\n\nThis is a form of what's called\n\nthe financialization of housing,\n\nand this really means the transition\n\nof housing from a social good,\n\nfrom something we need to live,\n\nto something that can be bought and sold and traded,\n\nand where people can make lots of money.\n\n@HobeheidarAli1 asks,\n\nWhy are there so few houses on the market?\n\nIt takes a very long time for developers\n\nto receive approvals to build their projects.\n\nIn Santa Monica, California,\n\nthe average development takes 48 months to be approved.\n\nThat's 48 months where the developer\n\nis waiting for approval before they can begin construction.\n\nIncreasing interest rates are also affecting housing supply,\n\nspecifically for existing homes.\n\nIf you purchase your home prior\n\nto the recent increases in interest rates,\n\nyou don't wanna sell and buy a new home\n\nand risk getting a bad interest rate.\n\nIf we look at housing supply prior to the financial crisis,\n\nit was pretty steady, but actually ramped up,\n\nright before the financial crisis,\n\nand then jumped off a cliff just plummeted.\n\n6 million Americans lost their homes.\n\nHousing production started up again,\n\nbut at a much slower rate\n\nbecause developers were a bit scared.\n\nDemand skyrocketed, but there wasn't enough supply\n\nto meet it.\n\nSome cities have seen actually a 50% reduction\n\nin housing inventory since the pandemic.\n\n@OurNewHomecoach says Serious question,\n\nwhere in the world\n\nare they getting housing policy right?\n\nI'd love to learn from that.\n\nOne place that's getting it right is Vienna in Austria.\n\nIt's dense, it's lively, it's vibrant.\n\nIt's a huge hub of culture.\n\nIn Vienna, 60% of people live in public housing.\n\nThat compares to about 1.5% in the US.\n\nThis chart shows the available housing in Vienna.\n\nAs you can see, about 57% is market rate,\n\nwhereas a huge percentage\n\nof the available housing is either public housing,\n\nmeaning it's owned and managed by the government,\n\nby private nonprofit organizations\n\nthat receive government subsidies to provide this housing.\n\nSo if you're looking at an apartment in Vienna right now,\n\nodds are that you would qualify for public housing\n\nbecause in Vienna, public housing is not just\n\nfor low income families.\n\nIt's also for middle income families.\n\nIn the United States, it is only for low income\n\nor very low income families.\n\n@yourfakem0ther says,\n\nWhat exactly are squatter's rights?\n\nSo what that means, in a place like New York,\n\nis that if someone lives on a property\n\nwithout a rental agreement for 10 years,\n\ntakes care of that property,\n\nis known by neighbors,\n\nis not doing that secretly,\n\nthey can claim that they have rights to that property,\n\nthat they are the owner of that property\n\nbecause they have used and maintained it\n\nfor that length of time.\n\nJust because you claim squatter's rights\n\ndoesn't mean that the property becomes yours.\n\nIt's a court mandated process.\n\nWhen you go to court to claim squatters rights,\n\nthe original owner can, of course, come\n\nand defend their right to own the property.\n\nIf you are successful, the property is deeded to you.\n\nIf you are unsuccessful, you have to vacate the property.\n\n@chippitydooda says, Is there anywhere affordable\n\nto live anymore?\n\nAlmost no.\n\nPlaces like California, New York City,\n\nthese are places where the home price to income ratio\n\ncan be around 10 to one.\n\nIt would cost you about 10 times your income\n\nto afford the median home price.\n\nThings get a little bit more affordable\n\nif you wander into smaller rural communities.\n\nSome places in rural Texas as well\n\nare a little bit on the more affordable scale,\n\nbut even these are becoming more and more unaffordable\n\nbecause the housing supply is dwindling in these areas\n\nbecause a lack of development interest.\n\nFor example, in a place like Buffalo,\n\nwhich is usually pretty affordable,\n\nhousing is becoming a scarcity\n\nbecause there isn't enough development,\n\nmeaning that it's becoming more and more expensive.\n\n@Thoreeeee says, Should I buy a house on Amazon?\n\nLet me know guys feeling impulsive.\n\nI would say that's not a good idea.\n\nThe Amazon listing of housing is really part\n\nof this broader trend of tiny homes.\n\nThese are very small homes\n\nthat can be built on very small plots of land\n\nwith just tiny homes.\n\nThese look like downsized mini versions\n\nof suburban developments.\n\nThis is exciting, but it's not a huge trend yet.\n\nOnly about 1% of the current active housing market\n\nare tiny homes.\n\nIt's not a solution to housing affordability.\n\n@roseydell says, What are the policies\n\nthat would bring down housing prices?\n\nWhat policies would help renters\n\nto have enough access to affordable housing?\n\nSo when we're talking about housing prices,\n\nwe're really talking about increasing supply.\n\nThat is what is going to bring house prices down.\n\nWhen you're talking about rentals,\n\nthere is of course, a need\n\nfor the increased supply of rental housing,\n\nbut policies can also be introduced.\n\nThe government gives tax incentives to developers\n\nbased on the promise that those developers\n\nwill include affordable units\n\nwithin their new developments.\n\nRent control and rent stabilization\n\nare things that are really helpful in certain contexts.\n\nSo there are about 16,000 rent control apartments\n\nin New York City\n\nand about a million rent stabilized apartments.\n\nRent control apartments are only those\n\nthat are built prior to 1947.\n\nThis means that rent prices are set\n\nat what's called a base maximum,\n\nwhich means that rent control apartments\n\ncannot fluctuate above that maximum rent.\n\nRent stabilization means that there are limits\n\nto how much the rent can increase year over year.\n\nSo those are all the questions we have for today.\n\nThanks so much for watching.\n\n[upbeat music]", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']",

buildings.\n\nPrevious to a couple of years ago,\n\nthe highest building you could build in the United States\n\nout of timber was six stories.\n\nNow, you can build 18 stories.\n\nSo we're going to start seeing high rises\n\nbuilt entirely of wood.\n\nIt's pretty amazing.\n\n@ReadLyte says, It will be interesting to see\n\nhow the value of oceanfront property changes\n\nas sea levels continue to rise.\n\nThis will be really interesting.\n\nSo far, though it really hasn't affected home prices.\n\n@Shmoawkjg asks, What is redlining?\n\nIt's kind of come to signify any sort\n\nof racial discrimination in housing,\n\nbut actually there's a really specific\n\nhistory around redlining.\n\nThis is a redlining map from Cleveland.\n\nIn the 1930s, the United States federal government\n\ndecided to start a new mortgage program\n\nto allow home buyers to access federally backed mortgages.\n\nThe government created these maps to determine\n\nwhere their investments would be safe.\n\nGreen areas, where you see down here,\n\nit's where the federal government felt\n\nthat their money would be well used.\n\nThey also created a D class or a red class,\n\nwhich was really a no-go zone,\n\nwhere the federal government did not want\n\nto provide government backed mortgages.\n\nThese redlined areas are where black families lived.\n\nIt made it very difficult\n\nfor residents living in these areas,\n\npredominantly black residents, to access mortgages.\n\nMany of these maps exist\n\nfor communities all across the United States.\n\nThese maps were not made public\n\nuntil 1978 when a historian stumbled upon them.\n\nIf you look at the neighborhoods\n\nthat were historically redlined,\n\nthese are still some\n\nof the most racially segregated neighborhoods\n\nacross the United States,\n\nand those effects are still felt today.\n\nMany of the historically redlined neighborhoods\n\nhave experienced disinvestment,\n\nand more recently,\n\nmany of them have become targets for gentrification,\n\ndisplacing many of these residents as well.\n\n@DonGhotti says, Is gentrification all bad?\n\nPretty much.\n\nThere's something called direct displacement.\n\nPeople are directly displaced from their homes\n\nbecause they can no longer afford the higher rents.\n\nSomething else happens as well\n\nthat's called indirect displacement.\n\nThe shops are different.\n\nThe community members are different.\n\nAnd so this is kind of making you feel uncomfortable\n\nin your own neighborhood.\n\nBoth of these things are bad.\n\nI think a lot of people think about gentrification\n\nassociated with these kind of design choices\n\nthat hipsters make.\n\nSo you think of the Helvetica house numbers\n\nor sometimes the gentrification fences around homes.\n\nReally, these are kind of an effect of gentrification.\n\nThey're not causing gentrification.\n\nGentrification is really caused\n\nby institutional investment in lower income neighborhoods.\n\nInvestors are coming in\n\nand recognizing what's called a rent gap,\n\nthe gap between the current rents\n\nthat are charged in low income area\n\nand the potential to charge higher rents.\n\nThese neighborhoods might be really centrally located,\n\nmight be near transit,\n\nand so investors see an opportunity to buy up\n\nand improve buildings\n\nand then take advantage of that gap\n\nby charging higher rents.\n\n@Burns12Regina says,\n\nI'm confused as to how exactly\n\nare Airbnbs affecting the housing market.\n\nA lot of rentals that would have been provided\n\nfor permanent residents have transitioned to Airbnb housing,\n\nwhich means it reduces the amount\n\nof total rentals available on the market\n\nand drives prices up.\n\nFor example, we can look to London.\n\nIt is the city with the largest number\n\nof Airbnbs in the entire world.\n\n50,000 Airbnb units were previously long-term\n\nrental units in London.\n\nThat means that 50,000 rental apartments\n\nwere taken off the market\n\nand are no longer available to permanent residents.\n\nAlso, some research has shown\n\nthat Airbnb's increasing\n\nactually contributes to gentrification\n\nand raising home prices in certain neighborhoods.\n\n@scottyzs_ says,\n\nHow the [beeping] did my parents buy a house\n\nat 26 years old while I have $2,000 in my bank account?\n\nI feel your pain, scottyzs_.\n\nReally, things are much different\n\nfor millennials than they were for boomers.\n\nWhen boomers were reaching the age to buy a home\n\naround the late 80s, early 90s.\n\nIf you made about $50,000 a year,\n\nthe average home at that point was about $121,000.\n\nSo that's really only about a two times\n\nincrease from your income.\n\nThere is a little bit of a dip here\n\nfollowing the 2008 recession,\n\nbut it increased dramatically since.\n\nThe median home price increased by 43%,\n\nwhere the median income only increased by 7%.\n\nThe average right now in the United States\n\nis a home price that is about six times the median income.\n\nIf you think about very expensive places\n\nlike the California coast or New York City,\n\nthat can be about 11 times the median income.\n\n@kevinvdahlgren asks,\n\nWhat is the leading cause of homelessness?\n\nThere are a lot of common misconceptions\n\naround people who are unhoused,\n\nthat perhaps drug use is involved,\n\nthat there are mental illnesses,\n\nand these things do exist,\n\nbut they are not the drivers of homelessness.\n\nRecent research from the University\n\nof California San Francisco actually found\n\nthat the leading cause of homelessness\n\nis a lack of access to affordable housing.\n\nIt's very easy to lose your home.\n\n8.5 million Americans right now are at risk\n\nof becoming homeless because rents are so high\n\nand incomes are so low.\n\nAny increase in rent\n\nor perhaps a medical emergency could be the difference\n\nbetween someone remaining in their home\n\nand becoming unhoused.\n\n@Nosemanoo says, Why are there so many homeless\n\nin Los Angeles?\n\nThere's a common myth that\n\nthere are a lot of unhoused people in Los Angeles\n\nbecause they move there for access to the good weather.\n\nThis is really not true.\n\nResearchers have found that the vast majority\n\nof people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles\n\nare from California,\n\nand even from that specific county,\n\nthat they previously had housing in that area\n\nand were then priced out of it and became unhoused.\n\nCalifornia, as you can see here,\n\nhas the most number of unhoused people\n\nof any state across the country.\n\nThis number has increased 40% since 2007.\n\nNew York also has a very high number\n\nof about 103,000 people.\n\nThere are differences though.\n\nMost of the unhoused people in California are unsheltered.\n\nThis means they don't have access\n\nto temporary shelter facilities.\n\nIn New York, the majority of those people are sheltered.\n\nThat's a result of a policy in New York City\n\ncalled Right to Shelter.\n\nNew York City is the only city in the country\n\nthat mandates the city to provide a shelter bed\n\nto every single person who requests it.\n\n@dawnjay_ says,\n\nWhy are corporations buying up houses just to rent them?\n\nWhy should any house be owned by [bleeping] Walmart?\n\nI don't know about Walmart,\n\nbut corporations are certainly buying up houses.\n\nThere was a lot of internet speculation\n\nabout a company called BlackRock,\n\nwhich is a private equity firm,\n\nbuying up single family homes and renting them out.\n\nThis isn't really happening.\n\nHowever, BlackRock is investing\n\nin real estate investment trusts that are investing\n\nin apartment building acquisitions and rentals.\n\nSo BlackRock isn't buying up suburban homes,\n\nbut they are investing in the rental market,\n\nand so corporations are recognizing real estate\n\nas an asset class that they would like to invest in,\n\njust like stocks and bonds.\n\nThis is a form of what's called\n\nthe financialization of housing,\n\nand this really means the transition\n\nof housing from a social good,\n\nfrom something we need to live,\n\nto something that can be bought and sold and traded,\n\nand where people can make lots of money.\n\n@HobeheidarAli1 asks,\n\nWhy are there so few houses on the market?\n\nIt takes a very long time for developers\n\nto receive approvals to build their projects.\n\nIn Santa Monica, California,\n\nthe average development takes 48 months to be approved.\n\nThat's 48 months where the developer\n\nis waiting for approval before they can begin construction.\n\nIncreasing interest rates are also affecting housing supply,\n\nspecifically for existing homes.\n\nIf you purchase your home prior\n\nto the recent increases in interest rates,\n\nyou don't wanna sell and buy a new home\n\nand risk getting a bad interest rate.\n\nIf we look at housing supply prior to the financial crisis,\n\nit was pretty steady, but actually ramped up,\n\nright before the financial crisis,\n\nand then jumped off a cliff just plummeted.\n\n6 million Americans lost their homes.\n\nHousing production started up again,\n\nbut at a much slower rate\n\nbecause developers were a bit scared.\n\nDemand skyrocketed, but there wasn't enough supply\n\nto meet it.\n\nSome cities have seen actually a 50% reduction\n\nin housing inventory since the pandemic.\n\n@OurNewHomecoach says Serious question,\n\nwhere in the world\n\nare they getting housing policy right?\n\nI'd love to learn from that.\n\nOne place that's getting it right is Vienna in Austria.\n\nIt's dense, it's lively, it's vibrant.\n\nIt's a huge hub of culture.\n\nIn Vienna, 60% of people live in public housing.\n\nThat compares to about 1.5% in the US.\n\nThis chart shows the available housing in Vienna.\n\nAs you can see, about 57% is market rate,\n\nwhereas a huge percentage\n\nof the available housing is either public housing,\n\nmeaning it's owned and managed by the government,\n\nby private nonprofit organizations\n\nthat receive government subsidies to provide this housing.\n\nSo if you're looking at an apartment in Vienna right now,\n\nodds are that you would qualify for public housing\n\nbecause in Vienna, public housing is not just\n\nfor low income families.\n\nIt's also for middle income families.\n\nIn the United States, it is only for low income\n\nor very low income families.\n\n@yourfakem0ther says,\n\nWhat exactly are squatter's rights?\n\nSo what that means, in a place like New York,\n\nis that if someone lives on a property\n\nwithout a rental agreement for 10 years,\n\ntakes care of that property,\n\nis known by neighbors,\n\nis not doing that secretly,\n\nthey can claim that they have rights to that property,\n\nthat they are the owner of that property\n\nbecause they have used and maintained it\n\nfor that length of time.\n\nJust because you claim squatter's rights\n\ndoesn't mean that the property becomes yours.\n\nIt's a court mandated process.\n\nWhen you go to court to claim squatters rights,\n\nthe original owner can, of course, come\n\nand defend their right to own the property.\n\nIf you are successful, the property is deeded to you.\n\nIf you are unsuccessful, you have to vacate the property.\n\n@chippitydooda says, Is there anywhere affordable\n\nto live anymore?\n\nAlmost no.\n\nPlaces like California, New York City,\n\nthese are places where the home price to income ratio\n\ncan be around 10 to one.\n\nIt would cost you about 10 times your income\n\nto afford the median home price.\n\nThings get a little bit more affordable\n\nif you wander into smaller rural communities.\n\nSome places in rural Texas as well\n\nare a little bit on the more affordable scale,\n\nbut even these are becoming more and more unaffordable\n\nbecause the housing supply is dwindling in these areas\n\nbecause a lack of development interest.\n\nFor example, in a place like Buffalo,\n\nwhich is usually pretty affordable,\n\nhousing is becoming a scarcity\n\nbecause there isn't enough development,\n\nmeaning that it's becoming more and more expensive.\n\n@Thoreeeee says, Should I buy a house on Amazon?\n\nLet me know guys feeling impulsive.\n\nI would say that's not a good idea.\n\nThe Amazon listing of housing is really part\n\nof this broader trend of tiny homes.\n\nThese are very small homes\n\nthat can be built on very small plots of land\n\nwith just tiny homes.\n\nThese look like downsized mini versions\n\nof suburban developments.\n\nThis is exciting, but it's not a huge trend yet.\n\nOnly about 1% of the current active housing market\n\nare tiny homes.\n\nIt's not a solution to housing affordability.\n\n@roseydell says, What are the policies\n\nthat would bring down housing prices?\n\nWhat policies would help renters\n\nto have enough access to affordable housing?\n\nSo when we're talking about housing prices,\n\nwe're really talking about increasing supply.\n\nThat is what is going to bring house prices down.\n\nWhen you're talking about rentals,\n\nthere is of course, a need\n\nfor the increased supply of rental housing,\n\nbut policies can also be introduced.\n\nThe government gives tax incentives to developers\n\nbased on the promise that those developers\n\nwill include affordable units\n\nwithin their new developments.\n\nRent control and rent stabilization\n\nare things that are really helpful in certain contexts.\n\nSo there are about 16,000 rent control apartments\n\nin New York City\n\nand about a million rent stabilized apartments.\n\nRent control apartments are only those\n\nthat are built prior to 1947.\n\nThis means that rent prices are set\n\nat what's called a base maximum,\n\nwhich means that rent control apartments\n\ncannot fluctuate above that maximum rent.\n\nRent stabilization means that there are limits\n\nto how much the rent can increase year over year.\n\nSo those are all the questions we have for today.\n\nThanks so much for watching.\n\n[upbeat music]", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']",

That makes sense to me.\n\nWhat episodes Bill Burr Breaking Bad.\n\nI did the car wash one first,\n\nthen I did the one with Lavell Crawford,\n\nwhere the guy drops the oranges and bangs his head,\n\nand I got to be in Saul Goodman's office, which was crazy\n\n'cause I was such an insane fan of that show.\n\nI probably got in I think two, three seasons in\n\nand I remember going in to Saul Goodman's office\n\nwhere he had the injustice for all, whatever he had,\n\nwe the people of the Constitution thing above his desk,\n\nand I felt like I got sucked into my TV.\n\nIt was incredible.\n\nAnd then I did the train robbery\n\nand I got to drive that big dump truck.\n\nAnd I remember the stunt guy was, like, nervous\n\ngoing like, Well you don't know what you're doing.\n\nI go, Well I'm only going half a mile an hour.\n\nI just let the clutch out and give it gas.\n\nI was young, I didn't know what I was doing.\n\nI don't know if I answered your question.\n\nI mean, I'm sure it's on IMDB.\n\nLike, am I your secretary?\n\nWhat made Bill Burr famous?\n\n[Bill chuckling] What made Bill Burr famous?\n\nWhat made me famous?\n\n30 years on the road. Seven specials.\n\nI mean, I was definitely a ham and egger.\n\nI was not, so you can see, blessed in the looks department.\n\nYou know what's funny?\n\nI did a movie one time and we were shooting outside\n\nand on, like, three different occasions on that shoot,\n\nsomeone would drive by and be like,\n\nHey Bill Burr, go fuck yourself!\n\nAnd I'd be like, Hey, how you doin'?\n\nWhat helicopter does Bill Burr fly?\n\nLike most people who learn to fly helicopters,\n\nI started off with Robinson's and then I wanted to move up\n\nand I was just like, these things are expensive as hell.\n\nAnd fortunately there's this company\n\ncalled Cabri that makes the Guimbal.\n\nCabri G2 for all you non-helicopter pilots.\n\nIt's a three-bladed system.\n\nIt's a baby A-Star,\n\nwhich is what the police and news people fly.\n\nI've flown a bunch of, I've rented 'em\n\nand stuff like that, the bigger ones.\n\nAnd I just fly, like, a little two-seater.\n\nSo it's funny, whenever I fly a bigger one,\n\nI'm always paranoid that the door's open\n\n'cause I'm used to, like, the door touching me\n\nas I sit there flying. [Bill chuckling]\n\nWhat is Bill Burr like in real life?\n\nI am an inquisitive person.\n\nI try to stay just ahead of my depression\n\nand if I'm learning something new,\n\nit's exciting, it's challenging,\n\nit's embarrassing 'cause I'm making mistakes\n\nbut I don't have to listen to the demons.\n\nIt shuts them up. Okay.\n\nThey start talking around 11:15, 11:16 every night.\n\n[board thumping]\n\n[Bill's hands scraping]\n\nAnd that's when the booze used to come. Not anymore though.\n\nNext one. There we go.\n\nDid you get paid as, like, a hand model?\n\nLike, back in the day?\n\nWhen is Bill Burr gonna shut up? No.\n\nWhen is Bill Burr going on tour? Great question.\n\nI just started up my umpteen-thousandth tour this year\n\nand this is my favorite hour and a half\n\nthat I've been doing on stage.\n\nI'm getting ready to do a special.\n\nIt's a unbelievable amount of fun to be on the road\n\nright now because there's so much serious stuff going on,\n\npeople need to laugh and they need something silly.\n\nActually, if there's any comedians watching,\n\nif you're feeling the gloom that most of us feel,\n\ngo on stage and just try to be a little silly.\n\nIt actually makes you lighter. I can't explain it.\n\nWhen did Bill Burr move to LA?\n\nI moved here with my lovely wife in September, 2007\n\nand two weeks later I bought a Prius.\n\nI just went all in.\n\nWhen did Bill Burr start comedy?\n\nI started comedy in March of 1992.\n\n32 years ago I started Nick's Comedy Stop.\n\nI started in Boston.\n\nI've always believed that I have lived a charmed life\n\nbecause what are the odds that I wanted\n\nto be a standup comedian and I was living in Boston,\n\nthe greatest standup comedy scene in the country, I feel,\n\nand it just had absolute murderers row\n\nof headlining comics there that you could learn from.\n\nKevin Knox, Frank Santorelli, Steve Sweeney,\n\nDon Gavin, Tony V, Bob Seibel, Rich Ceisler,\n\nall of these guys, all had their different own styles.\n\nKenny Rogerson, Mike Donovan.\n\nOne of the best things about starting off in Boston\n\nwas you knew what killing was.\n\nWhere I went down to this Tri-state area\n\nand I saw some of those city comics and people like that.\n\nOh dude, I slayed, I killed.\n\nAnd I remember thinking like, I mean, you had a good set.\n\nI wouldn't say you killed.\n\nYou weren't Knoxy Tuesday Night\n\nat Nick's Comedy Stop killing.\n\nAll right. Here we go.\n\nHow did Bill Burr end up on The Mandalorian?\n\nI ended up up on The Mandalorian through Jon Favreau\n\nwho listened to my podcast, used to always hear me\n\nmaking fun of Star Wars and thought it was funny.\n\nEnded up meeting him at a mutual friend's birthday party.\n\nHe goes, You know, there's a part in there\n\nthat we're writing right now\n\nand we think you would be good for it.\n\nAnd I was like, You know, Jon, I gotta be honest with you,\n\nI always kind of make fun of 'Star Wars.'\n\nNot in a malicious way, it's just\n\nI just see people really enjoying something\n\nand I just know, well that's an easy hit.\n\nIf I make fun of it, I can really just watch them get upset\n\nand you know, it fills up my day for whatever reason.\n\nHe goes, No, no.\n\nHe goes, I know I've heard it. I think it's hilarious.\n\nAnd think your fans would think it was funny\n\nif you were on this show.\n\nBy then, you know, my better half,\n\nNia was kicking me under the table\n\nand I was like, All right, yeah, let's do it. Let's do it.\n\nSo I get down there and the first scene I'm doing,\n\nI'm in a spaceship and I'm the only guy\n\nthat looks like a person.\n\nEverybody else has all this crazy makeup on\n\nand I'm sitting in there and I literally feel like\n\nI'm in The Muppets Take Manhattan.\n\nSo we're gonna rehearse the scene\n\nand I'm trying not to laugh.\n\nThe actors were so amazing. Immediately that all went away.\n\nI'm like, Oh my god, I'm gonna get my ass kicked in this.\n\nAnd I was totally locked in\n\nand I ended up having a great time.\n\nJon showed me a trailer\n\nof the first season of The Mandalorian.\n\nMy jaw was on the ground\n\n'cause it was like a spaghetti Western\n\nand we looked like Clint Eastwood was doing Star Wars\n\nand I was like, Oh my god, I can't believe\n\nI almost stuck my foot in my mouth and didn't get in this.\n\nAnd it's one of my favorite things\n\nI've ever done in my career.\n\nAnd I will say Star Wars fans are cool as hell.\n\nOkay, there we go.\n\nIs!\n\nI'm getting a little defensive.\n\nIs Bill gonna wrap this up?\n\nWas Bill ever gonna get a hair system?\n\nIs Bill ever gonna admit that it's not us, it's him?\n\nIs Bill Burr a Patriots fan?\n\nYes, absolutely.\n\nAll the way back to Jim Plunkett.\n\nI love the Patriots, whether they're good or bad,\n\nand I actually really enjoy\n\nhow much fans are giving me a rough time right now\n\n'cause the Patriots aren't good.\n\n'Cause all I hear is, We're so relieved\n\nthat you're not kicking our ass anymore.\n\nIs Bill Burr a drummer?\n\nThat's debatable. I play drums.\n\nI always say I'm a guitar center drummer.\n\nI'm a dad drummer. You know what I mean?\n\nIf you need, like, a cover, I can do a decent cover.\n\nI could be in a wedding band but an actual drummer, like,\n\nyou know, somebody comes in with a riff,\n\nyou have to come up with a drum part that fits that\n\nand not only compliments it, hopefully elevates it,\n\nthat's a musician.\n\nIs Bill Burr in Reservation Dogs?\n\nYes I am. I play Coach Bobson.\n\nThey actually asked me to come back a second time,\n\nbut unfortunately I was editing a movie I did\n\ncalled Old Dads so I didn't get to do it,\n\nand it kills me because they wrapped up that show.\n\nThey were building something\n\nand the people I worked with on that, you know.\n\nDon't listen to these people that talk about Holly.\n\nThere's a lot of great people in this business.\n\nAll right. [paper ripping]\n\nIs Bill Burr nice?\n\nAm I nice? You would have to ask other people.\n\nI try to be nice.\n\nAll right.\n\nIs Bill Burr political?\n\nI don't watch CNN. I don't watch Fox News.\n\nI don't pay attention to elections.\n\nHowever, I'm more interested on what corporations are doing\n\nand what they're getting away with\n\nand why people are allowing it\n\nand why, if you're running for office,\n\nif you start to say that that's what they're doing,\n\nthey just tar and feather you.\n\nI like what's behind it. It's kind of what fascinates me.\n\nDoes Bill Burr go to therapy?\n\nYeah. I haven't in a while.\n\nI will say that the biggest change for me\n\nis I took mushrooms.\n\nWhat I love about that drug\n\nis it doesn't make you want to do more.\n\nIt makes you want to deal with your life.\n\nBill Burr, Bill Hader.\n\nOh, to choose between the two?\n\nI mean, that's a no-brainer.\n\nYou gotta go Bill Hader all day.\n\nBill Hader is arguably the greatest\n\nimpressionist I've ever seen.\n\nI fucking love Bill Hader,\n\nand the fact that you would even have my name next to his,\n\nand the directing and the writing that he did on Barry.\n\nBill Hader is like, ridiculously underappreciated\n\nby all those foofy award shows.\n\nIt's ridiculous. This guy's a monster talent.\n\nAnd I think it's time he gets his goddamn hardware.\n\nWhat do you think of that?\n\nDoes Bill Burr start on time?\n\nUsually not because we have to have yonder bags\n\nand that's your guys' fault because you fuckin' assholes\n\nevery five seconds you gotta sit there and film.\n\nOh my god, what's my life right now?\n\nAnd then you edit it like CNN and Fox News\n\nto make me look as bad as possible to try\n\nto get me in trouble so you can get some more friends.\n\nI was here on time, right?\n\nI am on time. All right?\n\nI don't know how that yonder shit works.\n\nDid Bill Burr write F Is for Family?\n\nI wrote on it.\n\nI co-created the show with the great Mike Price.\n\nMichael was the captain of the ship.\n\nIt was a big writer's room.\n\nThere was 10 people in the room including myself.\n\nAnd that's another question people have,\n\nyou know, is my dad like Frank?\n\nFrank was an amalgam of all of our dads\n\nand I actually think towards the end\n\nhe was more me than anything.\n\nBill Burr, Adam Sandler.\n\nThis is about that movie Leo.\n\nI am blown away by, first of all,\n\nhow great the writing was on it,\n\nhow cool Adam was to work with.\n\nI did get to get in the booth with him a couple of times.\n\nHe's widely regarded out here as just the nicest guy\n\nand he literally is that guy.\n\nShows up, basketball shorts, big hoodie.\n\nAh, what's going on? You know, he's just awesome.\n\nI made him laugh a couple times,\n\nwhich was like the biggest thrill of my life.\n\nBut the big thing about that movie that I love\n\nis the amount of kids of all ages\n\nand parents that have come up to me\n\nand said how much they related to it.\n\nWhich I really think is a testament to everyone that wrote.\n\nThe writing on it was just next level.\n\nBill Burr.\n\nNext one.\n\nBest standup.\n\nI have ones that I like for a personal reason\n\nand somebody brought this one up.\n\nI did this bit on some benefit.\n\nSteve Jobs just died and I did a bit making fun of him.\n\nIt was something about how they said he changed the world.\n\nIt was basically making fun of\n\nhow he took credit for everything.\n\nAnd it's not on any of my specials,\n\nit's not on any albums or CDs.\n\nAnd I remember doing it\n\nand knowing that it was only gonna be there.\n\nDidn't save it for a special\n\nand that it would be this cool thing.\n\nAnd then I also loved it because it was a really rich crowd.\n\nThey were, like, auctioning off guitars\n\nand people were paying, like, six figures for 'em.\n\nSo I felt like their reaction,\n\nthe way I was making fun of him\n\nthat's like, they actually knew the guy,\n\nwhich made it even more enjoyable to do the bit.\n\n[Bill chuckling]\n\nWho is Bill Burr's opener?\n\nWhen you go to see me live,\n\nI don't bring cupcakes on the road.\n\nI'm not looking for a career opener.\n\nEverybody that's opened for me\n\nhas gone on to headline and crush it.\n\nPaul Virzi, who just shot a special, he used to open for me.\n\nHe hasn't opened for me now in, like, six years.\n\nWe still work a couple of times a year together.\n\nJoe Bartnick's another guy that moved on. Joey B.\n\nAnd right now I've been working with Dean Delray,\n\nBianca Cristovao, and Nate Craig.\n\nThere's an energy you put out as a comedian\n\nwhen you're doing new stuff.\n\nThere's an excitement.\n\nYou're present and all of that, and it's contagious.\n\nAnd when I watch them trying out new stuff, you know,\n\nI don't wanna be the dud, you know, on the show,\n\nI wanna do something too.\n\nSo like, I think it's really important\n\nto bring somebody that you believe can make it.\n\nAll right. Bill Burr, let's see here.\n\nBill Burr, Elvis.\n\nHe was the first, I feel, like, post-television superstar\n\nand had to deal with a level of fame\n\nwhere there was no roadmap.\n\nHe's the original behind the music.\n\nAnd if you look, he made every fuckin' mistake.\n\nSurrounded himself with yes men,\n\ndid drugs, married a 16-year-old.\n\nI mean, he just did everything.\n\nI don't wanna get into this too much,\n\nbut you know what I mean.\n\nDied alone on a toilet.\n\nBill Burr.\n\n[paper crinkling]\n\nFenway.\n\nThat was something that was so big.\n\nI think I only recently thought about it.\n\nI'll never forget just being on stage\n\nand seeing Fenway Park, 'cause we were out in center field.\n\nMy family, we used to always sit out in right field.\n\nIt was a great time.\n\nAnd to be able to come back all of those years later\n\nto get that kind of love from my home city was incredible.\n\nAnd it's not something that I will ever forget.\n\nThose questions all seem like they were from fans.\n\nI'm surprised it wasn't meaner.\n\n[Bill chuckling]\n\n[upbeat drums]", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image": "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill,d_placeholder_wired.png,fl_progressive,g_face,h_1080,q_80,w_1920/v1711637207/wired_google-autocomplete-inverviews-wi-autocomplete-bill-burr.jpg", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

That makes sense to me.\n\nWhat episodes Bill Burr Breaking Bad.\n\nI did the car wash one first,\n\nthen I did the one with Lavell Crawford,\n\nwhere the guy drops the oranges and bangs his head,\n\nand I got to be in Saul Goodman's office, which was crazy\n\n'cause I was such an insane fan of that show.\n\nI probably got in I think two, three seasons in\n\nand I remember going in to Saul Goodman's office\n\nwhere he had the injustice for all, whatever he had,\n\nwe the people of the Constitution thing above his desk,\n\nand I felt like I got sucked into my TV.\n\nIt was incredible.\n\nAnd then I did the train robbery\n\nand I got to drive that big dump truck.\n\nAnd I remember the stunt guy was, like, nervous\n\ngoing like, Well you don't know what you're doing.\n\nI go, Well I'm only going half a mile an hour.\n\nI just let the clutch out and give it gas.\n\nI was young, I didn't know what I was doing.\n\nI don't know if I answered your question.\n\nI mean, I'm sure it's on IMDB.\n\nLike, am I your secretary?\n\nWhat made Bill Burr famous?\n\n[Bill chuckling] What made Bill Burr famous?\n\nWhat made me famous?\n\n30 years on the road. Seven specials.\n\nI mean, I was definitely a ham and egger.\n\nI was not, so you can see, blessed in the looks department.\n\nYou know what's funny?\n\nI did a movie one time and we were shooting outside\n\nand on, like, three different occasions on that shoot,\n\nsomeone would drive by and be like,\n\nHey Bill Burr, go fuck yourself!\n\nAnd I'd be like, Hey, how you doin'?\n\nWhat helicopter does Bill Burr fly?\n\nLike most people who learn to fly helicopters,\n\nI started off with Robinson's and then I wanted to move up\n\nand I was just like, these things are expensive as hell.\n\nAnd fortunately there's this company\n\ncalled Cabri that makes the Guimbal.\n\nCabri G2 for all you non-helicopter pilots.\n\nIt's a three-bladed system.\n\nIt's a baby A-Star,\n\nwhich is what the police and news people fly.\n\nI've flown a bunch of, I've rented 'em\n\nand stuff like that, the bigger ones.\n\nAnd I just fly, like, a little two-seater.\n\nSo it's funny, whenever I fly a bigger one,\n\nI'm always paranoid that the door's open\n\n'cause I'm used to, like, the door touching me\n\nas I sit there flying. [Bill chuckling]\n\nWhat is Bill Burr like in real life?\n\nI am an inquisitive person.\n\nI try to stay just ahead of my depression\n\nand if I'm learning something new,\n\nit's exciting, it's challenging,\n\nit's embarrassing 'cause I'm making mistakes\n\nbut I don't have to listen to the demons.\n\nIt shuts them up. Okay.\n\nThey start talking around 11:15, 11:16 every night.\n\n[board thumping]\n\n[Bill's hands scraping]\n\nAnd that's when the booze used to come. Not anymore though.\n\nNext one. There we go.\n\nDid you get paid as, like, a hand model?\n\nLike, back in the day?\n\nWhen is Bill Burr gonna shut up? No.\n\nWhen is Bill Burr going on tour? Great question.\n\nI just started up my umpteen-thousandth tour this year\n\nand this is my favorite hour and a half\n\nthat I've been doing on stage.\n\nI'm getting ready to do a special.\n\nIt's a unbelievable amount of fun to be on the road\n\nright now because there's so much serious stuff going on,\n\npeople need to laugh and they need something silly.\n\nActually, if there's any comedians watching,\n\nif you're feeling the gloom that most of us feel,\n\ngo on stage and just try to be a little silly.\n\nIt actually makes you lighter. I can't explain it.\n\nWhen did Bill Burr move to LA?\n\nI moved here with my lovely wife in September, 2007\n\nand two weeks later I bought a Prius.\n\nI just went all in.\n\nWhen did Bill Burr start comedy?\n\nI started comedy in March of 1992.\n\n32 years ago I started Nick's Comedy Stop.\n\nI started in Boston.\n\nI've always believed that I have lived a charmed life\n\nbecause what are the odds that I wanted\n\nto be a standup comedian and I was living in Boston,\n\nthe greatest standup comedy scene in the country, I feel,\n\nand it just had absolute murderers row\n\nof headlining comics there that you could learn from.\n\nKevin Knox, Frank Santorelli, Steve Sweeney,\n\nDon Gavin, Tony V, Bob Seibel, Rich Ceisler,\n\nall of these guys, all had their different own styles.\n\nKenny Rogerson, Mike Donovan.\n\nOne of the best things about starting off in Boston\n\nwas you knew what killing was.\n\nWhere I went down to this Tri-state area\n\nand I saw some of those city comics and people like that.\n\nOh dude, I slayed, I killed.\n\nAnd I remember thinking like, I mean, you had a good set.\n\nI wouldn't say you killed.\n\nYou weren't Knoxy Tuesday Night\n\nat Nick's Comedy Stop killing.\n\nAll right. Here we go.\n\nHow did Bill Burr end up on The Mandalorian?\n\nI ended up up on The Mandalorian through Jon Favreau\n\nwho listened to my podcast, used to always hear me\n\nmaking fun of Star Wars and thought it was funny.\n\nEnded up meeting him at a mutual friend's birthday party.\n\nHe goes, You know, there's a part in there\n\nthat we're writing right now\n\nand we think you would be good for it.\n\nAnd I was like, You know, Jon, I gotta be honest with you,\n\nI always kind of make fun of 'Star Wars.'\n\nNot in a malicious way, it's just\n\nI just see people really enjoying something\n\nand I just know, well that's an easy hit.\n\nIf I make fun of it, I can really just watch them get upset\n\nand you know, it fills up my day for whatever reason.\n\nHe goes, No, no.\n\nHe goes, I know I've heard it. I think it's hilarious.\n\nAnd think your fans would think it was funny\n\nif you were on this show.\n\nBy then, you know, my better half,\n\nNia was kicking me under the table\n\nand I was like, All right, yeah, let's do it. Let's do it.\n\nSo I get down there and the first scene I'm doing,\n\nI'm in a spaceship and I'm the only guy\n\nthat looks like a person.\n\nEverybody else has all this crazy makeup on\n\nand I'm sitting in there and I literally feel like\n\nI'm in The Muppets Take Manhattan.\n\nSo we're gonna rehearse the scene\n\nand I'm trying not to laugh.\n\nThe actors were so amazing. Immediately that all went away.\n\nI'm like, Oh my god, I'm gonna get my ass kicked in this.\n\nAnd I was totally locked in\n\nand I ended up having a great time.\n\nJon showed me a trailer\n\nof the first season of The Mandalorian.\n\nMy jaw was on the ground\n\n'cause it was like a spaghetti Western\n\nand we looked like Clint Eastwood was doing Star Wars\n\nand I was like, Oh my god, I can't believe\n\nI almost stuck my foot in my mouth and didn't get in this.\n\nAnd it's one of my favorite things\n\nI've ever done in my career.\n\nAnd I will say Star Wars fans are cool as hell.\n\nOkay, there we go.\n\nIs!\n\nI'm getting a little defensive.\n\nIs Bill gonna wrap this up?\n\nWas Bill ever gonna get a hair system?\n\nIs Bill ever gonna admit that it's not us, it's him?\n\nIs Bill Burr a Patriots fan?\n\nYes, absolutely.\n\nAll the way back to Jim Plunkett.\n\nI love the Patriots, whether they're good or bad,\n\nand I actually really enjoy\n\nhow much fans are giving me a rough time right now\n\n'cause the Patriots aren't good.\n\n'Cause all I hear is, We're so relieved\n\nthat you're not kicking our ass anymore.\n\nIs Bill Burr a drummer?\n\nThat's debatable. I play drums.\n\nI always say I'm a guitar center drummer.\n\nI'm a dad drummer. You know what I mean?\n\nIf you need, like, a cover, I can do a decent cover.\n\nI could be in a wedding band but an actual drummer, like,\n\nyou know, somebody comes in with a riff,\n\nyou have to come up with a drum part that fits that\n\nand not only compliments it, hopefully elevates it,\n\nthat's a musician.\n\nIs Bill Burr in Reservation Dogs?\n\nYes I am. I play Coach Bobson.\n\nThey actually asked me to come back a second time,\n\nbut unfortunately I was editing a movie I did\n\ncalled Old Dads so I didn't get to do it,\n\nand it kills me because they wrapped up that show.\n\nThey were building something\n\nand the people I worked with on that, you know.\n\nDon't listen to these people that talk about Holly.\n\nThere's a lot of great people in this business.\n\nAll right. [paper ripping]\n\nIs Bill Burr nice?\n\nAm I nice? You would have to ask other people.\n\nI try to be nice.\n\nAll right.\n\nIs Bill Burr political?\n\nI don't watch CNN. I don't watch Fox News.\n\nI don't pay attention to elections.\n\nHowever, I'm more interested on what corporations are doing\n\nand what they're getting away with\n\nand why people are allowing it\n\nand why, if you're running for office,\n\nif you start to say that that's what they're doing,\n\nthey just tar and feather you.\n\nI like what's behind it. It's kind of what fascinates me.\n\nDoes Bill Burr go to therapy?\n\nYeah. I haven't in a while.\n\nI will say that the biggest change for me\n\nis I took mushrooms.\n\nWhat I love about that drug\n\nis it doesn't make you want to do more.\n\nIt makes you want to deal with your life.\n\nBill Burr, Bill Hader.\n\nOh, to choose between the two?\n\nI mean, that's a no-brainer.\n\nYou gotta go Bill Hader all day.\n\nBill Hader is arguably the greatest\n\nimpressionist I've ever seen.\n\nI fucking love Bill Hader,\n\nand the fact that you would even have my name next to his,\n\nand the directing and the writing that he did on Barry.\n\nBill Hader is like, ridiculously underappreciated\n\nby all those foofy award shows.\n\nIt's ridiculous. This guy's a monster talent.\n\nAnd I think it's time he gets his goddamn hardware.\n\nWhat do you think of that?\n\nDoes Bill Burr start on time?\n\nUsually not because we have to have yonder bags\n\nand that's your guys' fault because you fuckin' assholes\n\nevery five seconds you gotta sit there and film.\n\nOh my god, what's my life right now?\n\nAnd then you edit it like CNN and Fox News\n\nto make me look as bad as possible to try\n\nto get me in trouble so you can get some more friends.\n\nI was here on time, right?\n\nI am on time. All right?\n\nI don't know how that yonder shit works.\n\nDid Bill Burr write F Is for Family?\n\nI wrote on it.\n\nI co-created the show with the great Mike Price.\n\nMichael was the captain of the ship.\n\nIt was a big writer's room.\n\nThere was 10 people in the room including myself.\n\nAnd that's another question people have,\n\nyou know, is my dad like Frank?\n\nFrank was an amalgam of all of our dads\n\nand I actually think towards the end\n\nhe was more me than anything.\n\nBill Burr, Adam Sandler.\n\nThis is about that movie Leo.\n\nI am blown away by, first of all,\n\nhow great the writing was on it,\n\nhow cool Adam was to work with.\n\nI did get to get in the booth with him a couple of times.\n\nHe's widely regarded out here as just the nicest guy\n\nand he literally is that guy.\n\nShows up, basketball shorts, big hoodie.\n\nAh, what's going on? You know, he's just awesome.\n\nI made him laugh a couple times,\n\nwhich was like the biggest thrill of my life.\n\nBut the big thing about that movie that I love\n\nis the amount of kids of all ages\n\nand parents that have come up to me\n\nand said how much they related to it.\n\nWhich I really think is a testament to everyone that wrote.\n\nThe writing on it was just next level.\n\nBill Burr.\n\nNext one.\n\nBest standup.\n\nI have ones that I like for a personal reason\n\nand somebody brought this one up.\n\nI did this bit on some benefit.\n\nSteve Jobs just died and I did a bit making fun of him.\n\nIt was something about how they said he changed the world.\n\nIt was basically making fun of\n\nhow he took credit for everything.\n\nAnd it's not on any of my specials,\n\nit's not on any albums or CDs.\n\nAnd I remember doing it\n\nand knowing that it was only gonna be there.\n\nDidn't save it for a special\n\nand that it would be this cool thing.\n\nAnd then I also loved it because it was a really rich crowd.\n\nThey were, like, auctioning off guitars\n\nand people were paying, like, six figures for 'em.\n\nSo I felt like their reaction,\n\nthe way I was making fun of him\n\nthat's like, they actually knew the guy,\n\nwhich made it even more enjoyable to do the bit.\n\n[Bill chuckling]\n\nWho is Bill Burr's opener?\n\nWhen you go to see me live,\n\nI don't bring cupcakes on the road.\n\nI'm not looking for a career opener.\n\nEverybody that's opened for me\n\nhas gone on to headline and crush it.\n\nPaul Virzi, who just shot a special, he used to open for me.\n\nHe hasn't opened for me now in, like, six years.\n\nWe still work a couple of times a year together.\n\nJoe Bartnick's another guy that moved on. Joey B.\n\nAnd right now I've been working with Dean Delray,\n\nBianca Cristovao, and Nate Craig.\n\nThere's an energy you put out as a comedian\n\nwhen you're doing new stuff.\n\nThere's an excitement.\n\nYou're present and all of that, and it's contagious.\n\nAnd when I watch them trying out new stuff, you know,\n\nI don't wanna be the dud, you know, on the show,\n\nI wanna do something too.\n\nSo like, I think it's really important\n\nto bring somebody that you believe can make it.\n\nAll right.

{"title": "Marine Biologist Answers Fish Questions From Twitter | Tech Support", "text": "Transcript\n\nI'm Professor Kory Evans.\n\nI study fishes.\n\nLet's answer some questions from the internet.\n\nThis is Marine Biology Support.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\n@GabeSavage6 asked,\n\nIs 'Finding Nemo' an accurate representation\n\nof ocean life?\n\nYes and no.\n\nOne thing that they did get right\n\nis that clownfish do in fact live in anemones,\n\nand they are in fact immune to the stings of the anemones.\n\nOne thing that is pretty different\n\nis that clownfishes actually can change their sex.\n\nSo in the movie, Nemo's mom gets eaten,\n\nand in real life,\n\nafter a female clownfish is eaten or dies,\n\nthe largest male will then become the female.\n\nSo Marlin in Finding Nemo\n\nwould've actually become a female clownfish\n\nand laid his own clutch of eggs\n\nwithin probably the next week or two.\n\nSo another thing that's different is Bruce the Shark.\n\nSo in the movie Bruce the Shark is a male shark,\n\nbut if you look close,\n\nBruce the Shark does not have claspers.\n\nClaspers are the male intermittent organ the sharks have,\n\nthey're on the pelvic fins.\n\nThey're basically two very long penises.\n\nClear as day.\n\nAnd Bruce doesn't have them.\n\nSo Bruce is technically, maybe a female shark.\n\n@DoGsMoveSilent asked,\n\nWhy is white sand different from brown?\n\nWhite sand is generally derived\n\nfrom the shells of other animals.\n\nShells get broken down\n\neither via wave action or via animal feeding.\n\nAnd brown sand is different\n\nin that it's typically the result\n\nof rocks that have been eroded over time.\n\nMost of the white sand comes from very unlikely source,\n\nand that is parrotfishes.\n\nThey feed on coral skeletons,\n\nand when they excrete it,\n\nthey excrete it as this nice white fine sand.\n\nSo much of the white sand that you see\n\nis derived from parrotfish poop.\n\nA single parrotfish\n\ncan produce 450 kilograms of sand per year.\n\nSo that's a lot of poop, that's a lot of sand.\n\n@mayerwin asked, How do schools of fish swim in harmony?\n\nSo in order to answer that question,\n\nwe have to talk about the sensory systems of the fish.\n\nSo all fishes, for the most part,\n\nhave what we call a lateral line structure,\n\nwhich is just a long line that runs from head to tail,\n\nand it's covered with what we call mechanical receptors.\n\nThese are literal hair cells\n\nthat can sense changes in water pressure.\n\nThis is why if you ever try to catch a fish with your hand,\n\neven if it's looking away from you,\n\nit generally gets away from you.\n\nAnd that's because when you put your hand in the water,\n\nyou push water towards these lateral line cells,\n\nand the fish knows where you are without even looking.\n\nTypically in a fish school,\n\none fish will generally respond\n\nto the movements of the fish that's right next to it.\n\nSo as this fish moves,\n\nit's gonna push water towards the lateral line of that fish.\n\nAnd if you repeat that over a really large scale,\n\nthat's how you get\n\nthese really nice harmonious and synchronized movements\n\nacross fish schools.\n\nSwimming in schools makes it easier to move through water.\n\nWater is what we call highly viscous.\n\nSo when you have something in front of you\n\nthat's breaking up\n\nkind of the flow and distribution of water,\n\nmakes it easier for the thing behind it to swim.\n\n@muskoka_mike2 asked,\n\nWhy are orcas attacking boats?\n\nThe short answer is they don't want them there.\n\nThey're trying to move the boats out of the way,\n\nand the boats generally disturb their marine environments.\n\nHumans generally have a very long history\n\nof messing with whales, especially from boats.\n\nHumans basically wiped out\n\nmost of the whale populations in the Atlantic\n\nvia these whaling boats.\n\nThe unique thing about orcas\n\nis that orcas kind of have culture like humans do.\n\nThey have the ability to transmit information\n\nto subsequent generations\n\nwithout having to pass it on through their genes.\n\nSome orcas actually do have fashion.\n\nThere was a trend where one orca\n\nstarted wearing a fish as a hat,\n\nand later on the other orcas in the pods\n\nalso started wearing fish hats.\n\nAnd then this fashion\n\nactually jumped to other pods of orcas\n\nalso trying on the fish hat craze.\n\n@reds_cp asked, What is the fastest sea creature?\n\nNo Google.\n\nNo Google needed.\n\nThe fastest sea creature in the ocean is the sailfish.\n\nThese fish can get up to 50 miles an hour.\n\nMany of the fastest sea creatures\n\nhappen to be warm-blooded,\n\nor what we call endothermic.\n\nTunas are famously warm-blooded.\n\nThese animals are also high-speed swimmers\n\nat about 40 miles an hour for a tuna.\n\n@MyshkinFool asked, Serious question.\n\nWhere do shells come from?\n\nDoes marine life make them and then abandon them?\n\nAll shells come from animals,\n\ngenerally invertebrate animals\n\nthat basically lay these down as protection,\n\nand things like this conch shell,\n\nwhich is actually the remnant of a very large snail.\n\nMarine invertebrates over the past 300 million years\n\nhave evolved the ability\n\nto take in minerals from sea water and their food,\n\nlimestone or calcium carbonate,\n\nand construct them into these very elaborate exoskeletons.\n\nSometimes you'll find shells\n\nthat have holes in the top\n\nThey're simply from a marine predator.\n\nIt's like boring snails.\n\nWhere they'll actually drill a hole\n\ninto the shell of this animal and consume it.\n\nSome shells are really, really pretty,\n\nand you might be tempted to pick them up.\n\nOne example here is the cone snail shell,\n\nbut the animal that lives in these is incredibly dangerous.\n\nThe cone snail is actually a venomous snail.\n\nWe don't have a antidote for their venom.\n\nIf they're disturbed,\n\nthey will shoot a harpoon full of venom\n\ninto the pocket of the person\n\nwho's likely put the shell in their pocket.\n\nSo even though they're beautiful,\n\nsome shells should stay at the beach.\n\n@GeorgeM68340969 asked,\n\nThe starfish has no brain.\n\nSo how does it know it's hungry?\n\nThe short answer to this question\n\nis to assume the starfish is always hungry\n\nbecause they most likely are.\n\nThey are voracious predators.\n\nThe starfish has no brain,\n\nso it doesn't have a centralized decision-making center.\n\nHowever, each arm is packed with sensory structures,\n\nand each arm will basically taste the water,\n\nand once enough kind of tentacles\n\nstart pointing towards where the food is,\n\nthe entire animal\n\nwill then kind of move its body in that direction.\n\nOnce a starfish lands on something that it wants to eat,\n\nsay, this clam for example,\n\nit'll actually force the shell of that clam\n\nopen just a little bit,\n\nand it'll insert its stomach into the shell of the clam.\n\nSo it'll eject the stomach out of its own body\n\ninto the shell of this clam\n\nwhere it will then digest the clam inside its own shell\n\nand then draw the stomach back inside of them\n\nwhen they're done feeding.\n\n@neongundam asked, How can a mantis shrimp\n\nsee more colors than I can?\n\nYou're telling me\n\nthere's a color out there called blurple that I can't see?\n\nBrellow? Gred?\n\nMan [beep] science and [beep] shrimp.\n\nYes, the mantis shrimp and many other aquatic animals\n\nhave the ability to see far more colors than we can\n\nbecause they have more photoreceptors in their eyes.\n\nSo mantis shrimp can see well into the UV spectrum.\n\nI'm not even sure\n\nthat this is the craziest thing about mantis shrimp.\n\nSome mantis shrimp have the ability to punch so fast,\n\nit looks like a flick when they punch,\n\nthat their actual punch and club\n\ntears water molecules apart.\n\nAnd when the water molecules rush in to fill that space\n\nthat's been created,\n\nit causes them to boil at really, really high temperatures.\n\nInside of this little bubble of boiling water,\n\nthe temperatures can reach and exceed\n\nthe temperature of the surface of the sun.\n\n@DynamicWebPaige asked,\n\nSo freaking jealous of anglerfish sometimes.\n\nWhy didn't I evolve\n\nwith a built-in nighttime reading lamp?\n\nThe short answer is\n\nbecause you didn't evolve in the depths of the ocean\n\nand you don't have to draw your food towards your mouth.\n\nSo in the anglerfish head,\n\nthere's a fin at the top\n\nthat's been transformed into a lure.\n\nAnd in deep-sea angler fishes,\n\nthis lure is bioluminescent, so it lights up.\n\nAnd they use it to attract prey.\n\nWhat this anglerfish will do\n\nis it'll sit there in the middle of the water column\n\nwith this light-up lure in front of its face,\n\nand fish will come in thinking that it's food,\n\nand they will then themselves become food.\n\n@w_onderbot asked,\n\nWhat is the smartest animal in the sea?\n\nIt's hard to compare intelligence,\n\nbut I would probably argue dolphins.\n\nThey have the ability to pass the mirror test,\n\nwhich is being able to recognize themselves in the mirror.\n\nOther examples include octopuses.\n\nSome octopuses are able to solve maze problems\n\nin order to find food.\n\nAlso, fun fact, many octopuses have the ability\n\nto rapidly change their color to match their surroundings.\n\n@JPBlough asked,\n\nHow do octopuses change their color?\n\nTheir skin actually has the ability\n\nto see or perceive the color of the background\n\nthat they're sitting on,\n\nand that information is somehow passed on\n\nto the chromatophores that lives underneath the skin.\n\nEach chromatophore holds one pigment.\n\nThere might be a blue pigment,\n\na red pigment, and a yellow pigment.\n\nThey can rapidly change the distribution\n\nof these pigments in their skin.\n\nIt allows 'em to rapidly change color,\n\nand they have fine-scale control\n\nover each of these pigment cells.\n\n@MrMckenzieSD5 asked,\n\nHow do you tell a fish's age?\n\nSo fishes generally have indeterminate growth.\n\nHowever, there is a way to tell.\n\nThis is a 3D-printed fish skull.\n\nThere are a couple bones in the back of the skull here\n\nthat are called otoliths.\n\nThey're underneath the skull,\n\nbut if you were to pull them out,\n\nyou'd find these really nice coin-shaped bones\n\nthat have these concentric growth rings around them.\n\nSo fishes lay down these growth rings in their bone,\n\nmuch like trees do.\n\nSo you can actually count the rings in fish bone\n\nmuch like you would in a tree.\n\n@xo_dani asked, Fish fry at my grandma's today.\n\nFish with bones and fish without bones.\n\nYeah, this is how I classify my fish.\n\nThis is how I classify my fish too.\n\nSo it turns out\n\nyou can actually classify much of vertebrate diversity\n\ninto these really neat categories\n\nof fishes with bones and fishes without bones.\n\nAll the vertebrates that have jaws\n\ncan be broken into two distinct categories.\n\nSo there are cartilaginous fish,\n\nwhich are sharks, stingrays, and the rare chimaera.\n\nAnd then there are bony fishes,\n\nwhich include trouts, frogs, cats, dogs, and you and me.\n\nYes, even you and me.\n\nBiologists typically classify humans and mammals in general\n\nas a group of organisms\n\nwithin the larger clade of bony fishes.\n\n@CPFtrainer asked,\n\nDo all fish have similar numbers/types of fins,\n\nand what are these fins called?\n\nSome of the common fins you might see\n\nare these pectoral fins off on the side.\n\nPectoral fins in general\n\nare often used in hovering behaviors.\n\nSo you see these in fishes that live in coral reefs.\n\nSo things like wrasses and triggerfishes\n\nwill oftentimes flap their pectoral fins\n\nto hover over a structure\n\nto further investigate whatever is living in it.\n\nThe fins at the top are typically called dorsal fins.\n\nThe front dorsal fin is particularly interesting\n\nbecause they oftentimes get adapted into venomous spines,\n\nsometimes even fatal in the case of the stonefish.\n\nIn the case of this little Nile perch,\n\nit looks like one continuous dorsal fin,\n\nbut there's basically a skin connection\n\nbetween the front, spiny dorsal fin rays\n\nand the back, kind of feathery dorsal fin rays.\n\nThis back fin is called the caudal fin,\n\nand it's used to generate thrust.\n\nIf a fish is trying to get away,\n\nit'll beat this tailfin to help it move quickly.\n\n@Niv_Writes asked, Does coral count as an animal?\n\nIt's so alive and so pretty.\n\nIt is in fact an animal,\n\nand it's also alive and very pretty.\n\nThey're closely related to jellyfish,\n\nbut instead of floating in the ocean,\n\nthey build these complex limestone skeletons.\n\nSo you can see these little holes\n\nand pockmarks inside the coral skeleton,\n\nand that's where the individual polyps live.\n\nSo in life, this coral would be very, very colorful.\n\nHowever, this particular skeleton is bleached.\n\nSo when corals get stressed\n\nbecause of higher temperatures in the ocean,\n\nthey'll expel the algae that they keep inside their tissues,\n\nand they'll basically have no way to feed,\n\nand they'll starve\n\nover the course of the next several weeks.\n\nLosing these reefs,\n\nwhich can happen very, very quickly,\n\nwill have catastrophic effects\n\non tropical diversity worldwide.\n\nSo ways to prevent this include:\n\nreducing global temperatures,\n\ntaking climate change seriously in general,\n\nand in some very isolated cases,\n\npumping cold seawater back onto the corals.\n\n@elizabeth_roush asked,\n\nHow does the goblin shark even eat\n\nwithout its nose getting in the way?\n\nGoblin sharks have these very, very elongate rostra or noses\n\nthat they use to sense other animals in the water column.\n\nIn order to feed,\n\nthey actually have to protrude their mouth\n\nout away from their nose\n\nto catch prey and bring it back.\n\nIf you just try to bite something underwater,\n\nyou'll actually push it away from you.\n\nSo many animals have evolved the ability\n\nto protrude their mouths\n\nand generate suction to bring prey towards them.\n\nAnother one is the sling-jaw wrasse.\n\nThey have the ability to protrude their jaw\n\nup to a third of their total body length\n\nto bring in evasive prey, and then retract it.\n\n@jameson_rich asked, Never forget\n\nthat there's a creature on this earth\n\nthat was discovered and named by the people of science\n\nthe vampire squid from hell.\n\nSo, yes, vampire squids are real.\n\nThey are a thing.\n\nThey were discovered in the late 1890s\n\nin the Valdivia expedition.\n\nIf you dropped a net\n\nthinking that there would be no life\n\nat the bottom of the ocean\n\nand you pulled up that vampire squid,\n\nyou would name it the vampire squid from hell too.\n\nContrary to their appearance,\n\nwhich can be quite terrifying,\n\nthese animals have basically made a living\n\nout of doing nothing.\n\nThey live in oxygen minimum zones in the ocean,\n\nso they very rarely ever move,\n\nand they feed primarily on leftover food\n\nthat basically floats down from the surface.\n\n@Jacquel8277638 asked,\n\nOMG, when did whales learn to walk on land?\n\nWhales learned to walk on land about 35 million years ago.\n\nSo all whales, manatees, and seals\n\nevolved from ancestors that once walked on land.\n\nThese whale ancestors gradually became more aquatic,\n\nand as they got larger\n\nand as they became more adapted to aquatic habitats,\n\nthey evolved a broader range\n\nand a wider range of dietary strategies.\n\n@stephanieelino asked,\n\nThere's no way seahorses are real.\n\nSeahorses are quite real.\n\nSeahorses have been around for 13 million years,\n\nand in that time,\n\nthey've actually evolved a broad variety of body shapes\n\ntypically associated with camouflage.\n\nThere are things like the leafy seadragon,\n\nwhich looks like a piece of kelp.\n\nSeahorses are terrible swimmers, some of the worst.\n\nTo get around that,\n\nthey've evolved these prehensile tails\n\nthat allow them\n\nto basically wrap their tails around structures\n\nso that they can stay put.\n\nThe seahorse is perhaps most famous\n\nfor the fact that the male seahorse gives birth.\n\nThe female will transfer her eggs into the brooding pouch\n\nof the male seahorse,\n\nand then when the eggs hatch,\n\nthe male seahorse will actually give birth\n\nto the little seahorse babies.\n\n@bybrandonwhite asked,\n\nWhat is the best defense mechanism in the sea?\n\nMy favorite defense mechanism in the sea\n\nactually happens to be electricity.\n\nYou see this in torpedo rays and stargazers oftentimes,\n\nwhere if you grab them, you'll actually be shocked.\n\nThe way that they are able to shock you\n\nis using these modified muscle cells\n\nthat have evolved to be able\n\nto generate an electric current.\n\nFor some electric fishes,\n\nfor instance, the electric eel,\n\nthe current can be as strong as 600 volts.\n\nThe electric eel can drop a horse.\n\nBut perhaps the weirdest defense mechanism\n\nthat you'll see in the sea\n\nactually comes from hagfish slime.\n\nHagfish slime feels weird.\n\nIt feels wet, slimy, but also fibrous.\n\nSo as you pull it apart,\n\nit still has some consistency to it.\n\nIf a shark, for instance,\n\nwill come and take a bite out of a hagfish,\n\nbefore the shark can even bite down,\n\nthe hagfish will secrete slime\n\nand clog up the shark's mouth and gills,\n\nallowing it to make an escape.\n\n@MWSRXO asked, What do fish breathe in, water or air?\n\nWow, how do they make bubbles down there?\n\nSo fish actually breathe oxygen.\n\nThey bring in the oxygen from the water,\n\nand they extract it with their gills.\n\nThese gills are really sensitive.\n\nThey're often one or two cell layers thick.\n\nThey have to remain really thin to allow for gas exchange.\n\nThe internal structures here\n\nthat you can see in the gills are called gill rakers.\n\nThey'll swim through a school of plankton\n\nwith their mouths open,\n\nand these rakers in the gills\n\nwill trap the plankton\n\nwhile allowing water to pass through.\n\nOne way that fishes generate bubbles\n\nis through their gas bladder.\n\nSo some fish, like, for instance, the Dojo loach,\n\nactually has the ability to release gas out of its anus\n\nto sink further down into the water.\n\n@MJDookwah.\n\nIt's crazy how sea creatures\n\njust know exactly where to go when they migrate.\n\nSome marine animals\n\nwill follow the magnetic field of the Earth.\n\nBig migrations include the migrations\n\nthat we see in humpback whales,\n\nas they move from the tropics\n\nwhere they give birth and where they breed\n\nto temperate and colder feeding grounds\n\nwhere they'll feed on plankton.\n\nOther big migrations include salmon.\n\nThey grow up in freshwater,\n\nthey move out to the ocean,\n\nand then they can return\n\nto the stream that they were born in to reproduce.\n\nAnd they accomplish this\n\nby following the Earth's magnetic field\n\nand also tracking the scent of the stream\n\nthat they were born in.\n\n@TheHinduScience asked,\n\nWhat is the Diel Vertical Migration\n\nand its role in carbon sequestration?\n\nThe Diel vertical migration\n\nis the largest migration on the planet.\n\nThis occurs every night all around the world\n\nwhere plankton will actually move up\n\nfrom the depths of the oceans.\n\nThere's mixing of the carbon dioxide in the air\n\nwith the water right at the surface.\n\nPlant plankton will basically extract\n\ncarbon dioxide from the ocean\n\nand use this carbon to build their bodies.\n\nLarger plankton will then come and eat these plant plankton,\n\nand then fishes and other animals\n\nwill come eat the larger plankton as well,\n\nand then sink back down to the depths,\n\ntaking that carbon with them.\n\nSo it actually ends up being very important\n\nfor the sequestration of carbon dioxide.\n\n@C4_A_1 asked,\n\nDo you ever think about what lives in the Mariana trench\n\nand freak yourself out?\n\nYes.\n\nThe Mariana Trench is the deepest point in the ocean.\n\n36,000 feet deep.\n\nIt's deeper than Mount Everest is tall.\n\nWe have actually reached close to the bottom.\n\nJames Cameron and about six other ocean explorers\n\nhave taken submersibles down into the depths\n\nof the Mariana Trench.\n\nAt that depth, the ocean reaches pressures\n\nthat would basically crush us instantly\n\nif we ever went down there.\n\nBut many animals have evolved to actually live there.\n\nIn order to do so,\n\nvertebrates have generally reduced their bony skeletons.\n\nYou probably wouldn't find a megalodon\n\nat the depths of the Marianas Trench\n\nbecause megalodons actually evolved\n\nto live in shallow tropical waters like in The Bahamas.\n\nBut you might find like some weird clams.\n\n@C22HONCHO asked,\n\nHow do these bioluminescent waves work?\n\nDo people just throw glow sticks in there or what?\n\nThese bioluminescent waves are widespread around the world.\n\nYou can find them in places like Puerto Rico.\n\nYou can also find them off the coast of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThey're produced by plankton,\n\nand whenever plankton are startled or disturbed,\n\nthey'll release bioluminescence to disorient predators.\n\nSo they'll have little openings in their exoskeletons\n\nthat allow for light to be produced.\n\n@nekkohbk asked, Y'all knew jellyfish are immortal?\n\nLike them bitches don't die...ever.\n\nTurns out some jellyfish are in fact immortal.\n\nThe immortal jellyfish, so aptly named,\n\nhas the ability to revert back to its juvenile stage\n\nif it's ever injured or starving.\n\nIt will then later produce\n\na genetically identical clone of itself\n\nto further perpetuate itself.\n\nOther animals in the ocean are famously long lived.\n\nThe Greenland shark is a great example.\n\nThese animals can reach 600 years.\n\nMany of our large whales\n\ncan live for hundreds and hundreds of years.\n\nThere are still whales out there today\n\nthat have the old harpoons from harpoon ships\n\nstill embedded in them.\n\nSome lobsters can get pretty close to being immortal.\n\nWhenever a lobster grows,\n\nit actually has to shed its shell.\n\nThey're very vulnerable during molting process\n\nbecause their soft parts are basically exposed,\n\nand many animals are really cued in\n\nto find crustaceans that are molting.\n\nSo especially once they get older,\n\nit gets harder to escape that molting shell.\n\nSo a lobster that's been alive for 150 years\n\nmight finally die by, at last,\n\nbeing unable to escape that shell.\n\nThe estimates for lifespan are technically indefinite\n\nbecause if nothing eats them,\n\nthey can just keep going.\n\n@hannahexgirl.\n\nI need to know why evolution keeps making crabs.\n\nSo we don't know why things keep turning into crabs,\n\nbut things that are not crabs\n\nkeep turning into things that look like crabs.\n\nAn example of an animal\n\nthat has evolved into a crab is a hermit crab.\n\nHermit crabs are not true crabs.\n\nIf you're trying to picture what a hermit crab looked like\n\nbefore it became a hermit crab,\n\nit most likely looked quite a bit like a shrimp\n\nor a very skinny lobster.\n\nSo over the course of tens of millions of years,\n\nthese hermit crab ancestors began to roll their tails up\n\nand project them at weird angles,\n\nand also enlarge their claws,\n\nand eventually came to resemble\n\nthe crabs that we know today.\n\n@I_Am_Winter asked,\n\nFishes don't have eyelids, so do they ever sleep?\n\nThe answer to that is yes.\n\nDuring the sleeping process in fishes,\n\npart of the brain shuts off,\n\nbut they're still able to breathe.\n\nSo you can still see their gill flaps moving.\n\nThey have reduced response to stimuli\n\nso you can swim up\n\nand basically touch a sleeping fish in many cases.\n\nIn the case of whales,\n\nthe patterns are very much the same.\n\nPart of their brain\n\ntells 'em to go up and take a breath of air,\n\nand then they'll do that,\n\nand then they'll come back down,\n\nall while sleeping.\n\nSperm whales are really famous for this\n\nbecause they sleep vertically in pods.\n\nYou can stumble upon a pod of sleeping sperm whales\n\nthat look like big, tall forests in the middle of the ocean.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nThanks for watching Marine Biology Support.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image":

{"title": "Marine Biologist Answers Fish Questions From Twitter | Tech Support", "text": "Transcript\n\nI'm Professor Kory Evans.\n\nI study fishes.\n\nLet's answer some questions from the internet.\n\nThis is Marine Biology Support.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\n@GabeSavage6 asked,\n\nIs 'Finding Nemo' an accurate representation\n\nof ocean life?\n\nYes and no.\n\nOne thing that they did get right\n\nis that clownfish do in fact live in anemones,\n\nand they are in fact immune to the stings of the anemones.\n\nOne thing that is pretty different\n\nis that clownfishes actually can change their sex.\n\nSo in the movie, Nemo's mom gets eaten,\n\nand in real life,\n\nafter a female clownfish is eaten or dies,\n\nthe largest male will then become the female.\n\nSo Marlin in Finding Nemo\n\nwould've actually become a female clownfish\n\nand laid his own clutch of eggs\n\nwithin probably the next week or two.\n\nSo another thing that's different is Bruce the Shark.\n\nSo in the movie Bruce the Shark is a male shark,\n\nbut if you look close,\n\nBruce the Shark does not have claspers.\n\nClaspers are the male intermittent organ the sharks have,\n\nthey're on the pelvic fins.\n\nThey're basically two very long penises.\n\nClear as day.\n\nAnd Bruce doesn't have them.\n\nSo Bruce is technically, maybe a female shark.\n\n@DoGsMoveSilent asked,\n\nWhy is white sand different from brown?\n\nWhite sand is generally derived\n\nfrom the shells of other animals.\n\nShells get broken down\n\neither via wave action or via animal feeding.\n\nAnd brown sand is different\n\nin that it's typically the result\n\nof rocks that have been eroded over time.\n\nMost of the white sand comes from very unlikely source,\n\nand that is parrotfishes.\n\nThey feed on coral skeletons,\n\nand when they excrete it,\n\nthey excrete it as this nice white fine sand.\n\nSo much of the white sand that you see\n\nis derived from parrotfish poop.\n\nA single parrotfish\n\ncan produce 450 kilograms of sand per year.\n\nSo that's a lot of poop, that's a lot of sand.\n\n@mayerwin asked, How do schools of fish swim in harmony?\n\nSo in order to answer that question,\n\nwe have to talk about the sensory systems of the fish.\n\nSo all fishes, for the most part,\n\nhave what we call a lateral line structure,\n\nwhich is just a long line that runs from head to tail,\n\nand it's covered with what we call mechanical receptors.\n\nThese are literal hair cells\n\nthat can sense changes in water pressure.\n\nThis is why if you ever try to catch a fish with your hand,\n\neven if it's looking away from you,\n\nit generally gets away from you.\n\nAnd that's because when you put your hand in the water,\n\nyou push water towards these lateral line cells,\n\nand the fish knows where you are without even looking.\n\nTypically in a fish school,\n\none fish will generally respond\n\nto the movements of the fish that's right next to it.\n\nSo as this fish moves,\n\nit's gonna push water towards the lateral line of that fish.\n\nAnd if you repeat that over a really large scale,\n\nthat's how you get\n\nthese really nice harmonious and synchronized movements\n\nacross fish schools.\n\nSwimming in schools makes it easier to move through water.\n\nWater is what we call highly viscous.\n\nSo when you have something in front of you\n\nthat's breaking up\n\nkind of the flow and distribution of water,\n\nmakes it easier for the thing behind it to swim.\n\n@muskoka_mike2 asked,\n\nWhy are orcas attacking boats?\n\nThe short answer is they don't want them there.\n\nThey're trying to move the boats out of the way,\n\nand the boats generally disturb their marine environments.\n\nHumans generally have a very long history\n\nof messing with whales, especially from boats.\n\nHumans basically wiped out\n\nmost of the whale populations in the Atlantic\n\nvia these whaling boats.\n\nThe unique thing about orcas\n\nis that orcas kind of have culture like humans do.\n\nThey have the ability to transmit information\n\nto subsequent generations\n\nwithout having to pass it on through their genes.\n\nSome orcas actually do have fashion.\n\nThere was a trend where one orca\n\nstarted wearing a fish as a hat,\n\nand later on the other orcas in the pods\n\nalso started wearing fish hats.\n\nAnd then this fashion\n\nactually jumped to other pods of orcas\n\nalso trying on the fish hat craze.\n\n@reds_cp asked, What is the fastest sea creature?\n\nNo Google.\n\nNo Google needed.\n\nThe fastest sea creature in the ocean is the sailfish.\n\nThese fish can get up to 50 miles an hour.\n\nMany of the fastest sea creatures\n\nhappen to be warm-blooded,\n\nor what we call endothermic.\n\nTunas are famously warm-blooded.\n\nThese animals are also high-speed swimmers\n\nat about 40 miles an hour for a tuna.\n\n@MyshkinFool asked, Serious question.\n\nWhere do shells come from?\n\nDoes marine life make them and then abandon them?\n\nAll shells come from animals,\n\ngenerally invertebrate animals\n\nthat basically lay these down as protection,\n\nand things like this conch shell,\n\nwhich is actually the remnant of a very large snail.\n\nMarine invertebrates over the past 300 million years\n\nhave evolved the ability\n\nto take in minerals from sea water and their food,\n\nlimestone or calcium carbonate,\n\nand construct them into these very elaborate exoskeletons.\n\nSometimes you'll find shells\n\nthat have holes in the top\n\nThey're simply from a marine predator.\n\nIt's like boring snails.\n\nWhere they'll actually drill a hole\n\ninto the shell of this animal and consume it.\n\nSome shells are really, really pretty,\n\nand you might be tempted to pick them up.\n\nOne example here is the cone snail shell,\n\nbut the animal that lives in these is incredibly dangerous.\n\nThe cone snail is actually a venomous snail.\n\nWe don't have a antidote for their venom.\n\nIf they're disturbed,\n\nthey will shoot a harpoon full of venom\n\ninto the pocket of the person\n\nwho's likely put the shell in their pocket.\n\nSo even though they're beautiful,\n\nsome shells should stay at the beach.\n\n@GeorgeM68340969 asked,\n\nThe starfish has no brain.\n\nSo how does it know it's hungry?\n\nThe short answer to this question\n\nis to assume the starfish is always hungry\n\nbecause they most likely are.\n\nThey are voracious predators.\n\nThe starfish has no brain,\n\nso it doesn't have a centralized decision-making center.\n\nHowever, each arm is packed with sensory structures,\n\nand each arm will basically taste the water,\n\nand once enough kind of tentacles\n\nstart pointing towards where the food is,\n\nthe entire animal\n\nwill then kind of move its body in that direction.\n\nOnce a starfish lands on something that it wants to eat,\n\nsay, this clam for example,\n\nit'll actually force the shell of that clam\n\nopen just a little bit,\n\nand it'll insert its stomach into the shell of the clam.\n\nSo it'll eject the stomach out of its own body\n\ninto the shell of this clam\n\nwhere it will then digest the clam inside its own shell\n\nand then draw the stomach back inside of them\n\nwhen they're done feeding.\n\n@neongundam asked, How can a mantis shrimp\n\nsee more colors than I can?\n\nYou're telling me\n\nthere's a color out there called blurple that I can't see?\n\nBrellow? Gred?\n\nMan [beep] science and [beep] shrimp.\n\nYes, the mantis shrimp and many other aquatic animals\n\nhave the ability to see far more colors than we can\n\nbecause they have more photoreceptors in their eyes.\n\nSo mantis shrimp can see well into the UV spectrum.\n\nI'm not even sure\n\nthat this is the craziest thing about mantis shrimp.\n\nSome mantis shrimp have the ability to punch so fast,\n\nit looks like a flick when they punch,\n\nthat their actual punch and club\n\ntears water molecules apart.\n\nAnd when the water molecules rush in to fill that space\n\nthat's been created,\n\nit causes them to boil at really, really high temperatures.\n\nInside of this little bubble of boiling water,\n\nthe temperatures can reach and exceed\n\nthe temperature of the surface of the sun.\n\n@DynamicWebPaige asked,\n\nSo freaking jealous of anglerfish sometimes.\n\nWhy didn't I evolve\n\nwith a built-in nighttime reading lamp?\n\nThe short answer is\n\nbecause you didn't evolve in the depths of the ocean\n\nand you don't have to draw your food towards your mouth.\n\nSo in the anglerfish head,\n\nthere's a fin at the top\n\nthat's been transformed into a lure.\n\nAnd in deep-sea angler fishes,\n\nthis lure is bioluminescent, so it lights up.\n\nAnd they use it to attract prey.\n\nWhat this anglerfish will do\n\nis it'll sit there in the middle of the water column\n\nwith this light-up lure in front of its face,\n\nand fish will come in thinking that it's food,\n\nand they will then themselves become food.\n\n@w_onderbot asked,\n\nWhat is the smartest animal in the sea?\n\nIt's hard to compare intelligence,\n\nbut I would probably argue dolphins.\n\nThey have the ability to pass the mirror test,\n\nwhich is being able to recognize themselves in the mirror.\n\nOther examples include octopuses.\n\nSome octopuses are able to solve maze problems\n\nin order to find food.\n\nAlso, fun fact, many octopuses have the ability\n\nto rapidly change their color to match their surroundings.\n\n@JPBlough asked,\n\nHow do octopuses change their color?\n\nTheir skin actually has the ability\n\nto see or perceive the color of the background\n\nthat they're sitting on,\n\nand that information is somehow passed on\n\nto the chromatophores that lives underneath the skin.\n\nEach chromatophore holds one pigment.\n\nThere might be a blue pigment,\n\na red pigment, and a yellow pigment.\n\nThey can rapidly change the distribution\n\nof these pigments in their skin.\n\nIt allows 'em to rapidly change color,\n\nand they have fine-scale control\n\nover each of these pigment cells.\n\n@MrMckenzieSD5 asked,\n\nHow do you tell a fish's age?\n\nSo fishes generally have indeterminate growth.\n\nHowever, there is a way to tell.\n\nThis is a 3D-printed fish skull.\n\nThere are a couple bones in the back of the skull here\n\nthat are called otoliths.\n\nThey're underneath the skull,\n\nbut if you were to pull them out,\n\nyou'd find these really nice coin-shaped bones\n\nthat have these concentric growth rings around them.\n\nSo fishes lay down these growth rings in their bone,\n\nmuch like trees do.\n\nSo you can actually count the rings in fish bone\n\nmuch like you would in a tree.\n\n@xo_dani asked, Fish fry at my grandma's today.\n\nFish with bones and fish without bones.\n\nYeah, this is how I classify my fish.\n\nThis is how I classify my fish too.\n\nSo it turns out\n\nyou can actually classify much of vertebrate diversity\n\ninto these really neat categories\n\nof fishes with bones and fishes without bones.\n\nAll the vertebrates that have jaws\n\ncan be broken into two distinct categories.\n\nSo there are cartilaginous fish,\n\nwhich are sharks, stingrays, and the rare chimaera.\n\nAnd then there are bony fishes,\n\nwhich include trouts, frogs, cats, dogs, and you and me.\n\nYes, even you and me.\n\nBiologists typically classify humans and mammals in general\n\nas a group of organisms\n\nwithin the larger clade of bony fishes.\n\n@CPFtrainer asked,\n\nDo all fish have similar numbers/types of fins,\n\nand what are these fins called?\n\nSome of the common fins you might see\n\nare these pectoral fins off on the side.\n\nPectoral fins in general\n\nare often used in hovering behaviors.\n\nSo you see these in fishes that live in coral reefs.\n\nSo things like wrasses and triggerfishes\n\nwill oftentimes flap their pectoral fins\n\nto hover over a structure\n\nto further investigate whatever is living in it.\n\nThe fins at the top are typically called dorsal fins.\n\nThe front dorsal fin is particularly interesting\n\nbecause they oftentimes get adapted into venomous spines,\n\nsometimes even fatal in the case of the stonefish.\n\nIn the case of this little Nile perch,\n\nit looks like one continuous dorsal fin,\n\nbut there's basically a skin connection\n\nbetween the front, spiny dorsal fin rays\n\nand the back, kind of feathery dorsal fin rays.\n\nThis back fin is called the caudal fin,\n\nand it's used to generate thrust.\n\nIf a fish is trying to get away,\n\nit'll beat this tailfin to help it move quickly.\n\n@Niv_Writes asked, Does coral count as an animal?\n\nIt's so alive and so pretty.\n\nIt is in fact an animal,\n\nand it's also alive and very pretty.\n\nThey're closely related to jellyfish,\n\nbut instead of floating in the ocean,\n\nthey build these complex limestone skeletons.\n\nSo you can see these little holes\n\nand pockmarks inside the coral skeleton,\n\nand that's where the individual polyps live.\n\nSo in life, this coral would be very, very colorful.\n\nHowever, this particular skeleton is bleached.\n\nSo when corals get stressed\n\nbecause of higher temperatures in the ocean,\n\nthey'll expel the algae that they keep inside their tissues,\n\nand they'll basically have no way to feed,\n\nand they'll starve\n\nover the course of the next several weeks.\n\nLosing these reefs,\n\nwhich can happen very, very quickly,\n\nwill have catastrophic effects\n\non tropical diversity worldwide.\n\nSo ways to prevent this include:\n\nreducing global temperatures,\n\ntaking climate change seriously in general,\n\nand in some very isolated cases,\n\npumping cold seawater back onto the corals.\n\n@elizabeth_roush asked,\n\nHow does the goblin shark even eat\n\nwithout its nose getting in the way?\n\nGoblin sharks have these very, very elongate rostra or noses\n\nthat they use to sense other animals in the water column.\n\nIn order to feed,\n\nthey actually have to protrude their mouth\n\nout away from their nose\n\nto catch prey and bring it back.\n\nIf you just try to bite something underwater,\n\nyou'll actually push it away from you.\n\nSo many animals have evolved the ability\n\nto protrude their mouths\n\nand generate suction to bring prey towards them.\n\nAnother one is the sling-jaw wrasse.\n\nThey have the ability to protrude their jaw\n\nup to a third of their total body length\n\nto bring in evasive prey, and then retract it.\n\n@jameson_rich asked, Never forget\n\nthat there's a creature on this earth\n\nthat was discovered and named by the people of science\n\nthe vampire squid from hell.\n\nSo, yes, vampire squids are real.\n\nThey are a thing.\n\nThey were discovered in the late 1890s\n\nin the Valdivia expedition.\n\nIf you dropped a net\n\nthinking that there would be no life\n\nat the bottom of the ocean\n\nand you pulled up that vampire squid,\n\nyou would name it the vampire squid from hell too.\n\nContrary to their appearance,\n\nwhich can be quite terrifying,\n\nthese animals have basically made a living\n\nout of doing nothing.\n\nThey live in oxygen minimum zones in the ocean,\n\nso they very rarely ever move,\n\nand they feed primarily on leftover food\n\nthat basically floats down from the surface.\n\n@Jacquel8277638 asked,\n\nOMG, when did whales learn to walk on land?\n\nWhales learned to walk on land about 35 million years ago.\n\nSo all whales, manatees, and seals\n\nevolved from ancestors that once walked on land.\n\nThese whale ancestors gradually became more aquatic,\n\nand as they got larger\n\nand as they became more adapted to aquatic habitats,\n\nthey evolved a broader range\n\nand a wider range of dietary strategies.\n\n@stephanieelino asked,\n\nThere's no way seahorses are real.\n\nSeahorses are quite real.\n\nSeahorses have been around for 13 million years,\n\nand in that time,\n\nthey've actually evolved a broad variety of body shapes\n\ntypically associated with camouflage.\n\nThere are things like the leafy seadragon,\n\nwhich looks like a piece of kelp.\n\nSeahorses are terrible swimmers, some of the worst.\n\nTo get around that,\n\nthey've evolved these prehensile tails\n\nthat allow them\n\nto basically wrap their tails around structures\n\nso that they can stay put.\n\nThe seahorse is perhaps most famous\n\nfor the fact that the male seahorse gives birth.\n\nThe female will transfer her eggs into the brooding pouch\n\nof the male seahorse,\n\nand then when the eggs hatch,\n\nthe male seahorse will actually give birth\n\nto the little seahorse babies.\n\n@bybrandonwhite asked,\n\nWhat is the best defense mechanism in the sea?\n\nMy favorite defense mechanism in the sea\n\nactually happens to be electricity.\n\nYou see this in torpedo rays and stargazers oftentimes,\n\nwhere if you grab them, you'll actually be shocked.\n\nThe way that they are able to shock you\n\nis using these modified muscle cells\n\nthat have evolved to be able\n\nto generate an electric current.\n\nFor some electric fishes,\n\nfor instance, the electric eel,\n\nthe current can be as strong as 600 volts.\n\nThe electric eel can drop a horse.\n\nBut perhaps the weirdest defense mechanism\n\nthat you'll see in the sea\n\nactually comes from hagfish slime.\n\nHagfish slime feels weird.\n\nIt feels wet, slimy, but also fibrous.\n\nSo as you pull it apart,\n\nit still has some consistency to it.\n\nIf a shark, for instance,\n\nwill come and take a bite out of a hagfish,\n\nbefore the shark can even bite down,\n\nthe hagfish will secrete slime\n\nand clog up the shark's mouth and gills,\n\nallowing it to make an escape.\n\n@MWSRXO asked, What do fish breathe in, water or air?\n\nWow, how do they make bubbles down there?\n\nSo fish actually breathe oxygen.\n\nThey bring in the oxygen from the water,\n\nand they extract it with their gills.\n\nThese gills are really sensitive.\n\nThey're often one or two cell layers thick.\n\nThey have to remain really thin to allow for gas exchange.\n\nThe internal structures here\n\nthat you can see in the gills are called gill rakers.\n\nThey'll swim through a school of plankton\n\nwith their mouths open,\n\nand these rakers in the gills\n\nwill trap the plankton\n\nwhile allowing water to pass through.\n\nOne way that fishes generate bubbles\n\nis through their gas bladder.\n\nSo some fish, like, for instance, the Dojo loach,\n\nactually has the ability to release gas out of its anus\n\nto sink further down into the water.\n\n@MJDookwah.\n\nIt's crazy how sea creatures\n\njust know exactly where to go when they migrate.\n\nSome marine animals\n\nwill follow the magnetic field of the Earth.\n\nBig migrations include the migrations\n\nthat we see in humpback whales,\n\nas they move from the tropics\n\nwhere they give birth and where they breed\n\nto temperate and colder feeding grounds\n\nwhere they'll feed on plankton.\n\nOther big migrations include salmon.\n\nThey grow up in freshwater,\n\nthey move out to the ocean,\n\nand then they can return\n\nto the stream that they were born in to reproduce.\n\nAnd they accomplish this\n\nby following the Earth's magnetic field\n\nand also tracking the scent of the stream\n\nthat they were born in.\n\n@TheHinduScience asked,\n\nWhat is the Diel Vertical Migration\n\nand its role in carbon sequestration?\n\nThe Diel vertical migration\n\nis the largest migration on the planet.\n\nThis occurs every night all around the world\n\nwhere plankton will actually move up\n\nfrom the depths of the oceans.\n\nThere's mixing of the carbon dioxide in the air\n\nwith the water right at the surface.\n\nPlant plankton will basically extract\n\ncarbon dioxide from the ocean\n\nand use this carbon to build their bodies.\n\nLarger plankton will then come and eat these plant plankton,\n\nand then fishes and other animals\n\nwill come eat the larger plankton as well,\n\nand then sink back down to the depths,\n\ntaking that carbon with them.\n\nSo it actually ends up being very important\n\nfor the sequestration of carbon dioxide.\n\n@C4_A_1 asked,\n\nDo you ever think about what lives in the Mariana trench\n\nand freak yourself out?\n\nYes.\n\nThe Mariana Trench is the deepest point in the ocean.\n\n36,000 feet deep.\n\nIt's deeper than Mount Everest is tall.\n\nWe have actually reached close to the bottom.\n\nJames Cameron and about six other ocean explorers\n\nhave taken submersibles down into the depths\n\nof the Mariana Trench.\n\nAt that depth, the ocean reaches pressures\n\nthat would basically crush us instantly\n\nif we ever went down there.\n\nBut many animals have evolved to actually live there.\n\nIn order to do so,\n\nvertebrates have generally reduced their bony skeletons.\n\nYou probably wouldn't find a megalodon\n\nat the depths of the Marianas Trench\n\nbecause megalodons actually evolved\n\nto live in shallow tropical waters like in The Bahamas.\n\nBut you might find like some weird clams.\n\n@C22HONCHO asked,\n\nHow do these bioluminescent waves work?\n\nDo people just throw glow sticks in there or what?\n\nThese bioluminescent waves are widespread around the world.\n\nYou can find them in places like Puerto Rico.\n\nYou can also find them off the coast of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThey're produced by plankton,\n\nand whenever plankton are startled or disturbed,\n\nthey'll release bioluminescence to disorient predators.\n\nSo they'll have little openings in their exoskeletons\n\nthat allow for light to be produced.\n\n@nekkohbk asked, Y'all knew jellyfish are immortal?\n\nLike them bitches don't die...ever.\n\nTurns out some jellyfish are in fact immortal.\n\nThe immortal jellyfish, so aptly named,\n\nhas the ability to revert back to its juvenile stage\n\nif it's ever injured or starving.\n\nIt will then later produce\n\na genetically identical clone of itself\n\nto further perpetuate itself.\n\nOther animals in the ocean are famously long lived.\n\nThe Greenland shark is a great example.\n\nThese animals can reach 600 years.\n\nMany of our large whales\n\ncan live for hundreds and hundreds of years.\n\nThere are still whales out there today\n\nthat have the old harpoons from harpoon ships\n\nstill embedded in them.\n\nSome lobsters can get pretty close to being immortal.\n\nWhenever a lobster grows,\n\nit actually has to shed its shell.\n\nThey're very vulnerable during molting process\n\nbecause their soft parts are basically exposed,\n\nand many animals are really cued in\n\nto find crustaceans that are molting.\n\nSo especially once they get older,\n\nit gets harder to escape that molting shell.\n\nSo a lobster that's been alive for 150 years\n\nmight finally die by, at last,\n\nbeing unable to escape that shell.\n\nThe estimates for lifespan are technically indefinite\n\nbecause if nothing eats them,\n\nthey can just keep going.\n\n@hannahexgirl.\n\nI need to know why evolution keeps making crabs.\n\nSo we don't know why things keep turning into crabs,\n\nbut things that are not crabs\n\nkeep turning into things that look like crabs.\n\nAn example of an animal\n\nthat has evolved into a crab is a hermit crab.\n\nHermit crabs are not true crabs.\n\nIf you're trying to picture what a hermit crab looked like\n\nbefore it became a hermit crab,\n\nit most likely looked quite a bit like a shrimp\n\nor a very skinny lobster.\n\nSo over the course of tens of millions of years,\n\nthese hermit crab ancestors began to roll their tails up\n\nand project them at weird angles,\n\nand also enlarge their claws,\n\nand eventually came to resemble\n\nthe crabs that we know today.\n\n@I_Am_Winter asked,\n\nFishes don't have eyelids, so do they ever sleep?\n\nThe answer to that is yes.\n\nDuring the sleeping process in fishes,\n\npart of the brain shuts off,\n\nbut they're still able to breathe.\n\nSo you can still see their gill flaps moving.\n\nThey have reduced response to stimuli\n\nso you can swim up\n\nand basically touch a sleeping fish in many cases.\n\nIn the case of whales,\n\nthe patterns are very much the same.\n\nPart of their brain\n\ntells 'em to go up and take a breath of air,\n\nand then they'll do that,\n\nand then they'll come back down,\n\nall while sleeping.\n\nSperm whales are really famous for this\n\nbecause they sleep vertically in pods.\n\nYou can stumble upon a pod of sleeping sperm whales\n\nthat look like big, tall forests in the middle of the ocean.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nThanks for watching Marine Biology Support.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image":

{"title": "Cardiologist Answers Heart Questions From Twitter | Tech Support", "text": "Transcript\n\nI'm Sunil Rao, a cardiologist at NYU Langone Health.\n\nLet's answer some questions from the internet.\n\nThis is Heart Support.\n\n[upbeat rhythmic music]\n\n@ThiggyMan asks: Ay...\n\nWhat heart rate is considered too high?\n\nThere's no one number\n\nthat's considered too high for everyone.\n\nIf you have a fever, if you have the flu,\n\nyour heart rate may go up to 120, 130,\n\nand that's probably, quote, too high for you.\n\nLet's say you're on the treadmill and you're wondering,\n\nGosh, how high should my heart rate get?\n\nWell, there's a rule of thumb that you can remember.\n\n220 minus your age.\n\nSo let's say you're 40 years old.\n\nThat would equal 180 beats per minute,\n\nwhich would be really the maximum heart rate\n\nthat you're aiming for.\n\nReally what you wanna do is try to get\n\nto about 70 to 85% of that heart rate,\n\nwhich would be somewhere between 145\n\nand 155 beats per minute while you're exercising.\n\nIf you notice that your heart rate's going above 180,\n\nyou probably oughta cut back a little bit.\n\ntehRisa asks: I need a doctor to tell me medically\n\nwhat is happening in my chest when my heart skips a beat\n\nwhile reading a cute romance manga.\n\nOccasionally what will happen is that the heart\n\nwill have a beat that occurs prematurely.\n\nWell, the heart has a way to compensate for that.\n\nIt has a pause,\n\nand then it gets back on rhythm.\n\nIt's that pause that you're feeling\n\nwhen you say your heart is skipping a beat.\n\nMany of us have occasional skipped beats that happen.\n\nMaybe we had a little too much caffeine that day.\n\nMaybe we're nervous about a job interview,\n\nnervous about a first date.\n\nThat's very, very common.\n\nBut if you notice that your heart is skipping beats a lot,\n\nyou may have what's called an arrhythmia.\n\nArrhythmia's just a general term\n\nthat says there's something wrong\n\nwith the electrical system:\n\natrial fibrillation, atrial flutter,\n\nventricular tachycardia, there are a whole bunch\n\nof other things that can be diagnosed very, very easily\n\nby getting an EKG.\n\nOkay, so next question.\n\nEKGs, how do they work?\n\nEKG is an electrocardiogram.\n\nHere's a normal EKG.\n\nAnd you can see that these lines are occurring\n\nat a very regular interval.\n\nAnd the baseline has a few curves on it,\n\nbut those curves are pretty much the same\n\nwith every single beat that's happening.\n\nThat's a normal EKG.\n\nAnd what does an abnormal EKG look like?\n\nFirst of all, these deflections that are going up and down\n\nare occurring very, very irregularly.\n\nLook at the spaces between these deflections.\n\nYou see how there's so many different waveforms here?\n\nThere are lots of lumps and bumps.\n\nThis is an EKG of a person who has something\n\ncalled atrial fibrillation.\n\nAnd that's when the top chambers\n\nof the heart beat irregularly.\n\nSo let's go to our heart model.\n\nSo there are the upper chambers of the heart,\n\nand there are the lower chambers of the heart.\n\nWhen someone has atrial fibrillation,\n\nthe top chambers of the heart stop beating.\n\nAnd that's that irregular waveform\n\nthat you pick up on the EKG.\n\nThe problem with that is that the blood can pool\n\nin parts of the heart.\n\nAnd if it forms a blood clot,\n\nno matter how tiny it might be inside the heart,\n\nand that blood clot travels to your brain,\n\nit can put you at risk for having a stroke.\n\n@ChicagoSeavey asks: Guys I can hear my heartbeat...\n\nWithout a stethoscope????\n\nIs that normal???\n\nIt's very, very common to hear your heartbeat in your ear.\n\nSo a lotta people can hear it when they're laying down\n\nand when they're going to sleep.\n\nYou may be even be hearing the blood going\n\nthrough the blood vessels in your neck.\n\nSome people hear it, some people don't.\n\nThat's a very, very common finding\n\nand really nothing to worry about.\n\n@BaseballMurse7 asks: True or false:\n\nyou can restart the heart with a defibrillator?\n\nWell, that's true, you can.\n\nNow, there are a couple things that are important\n\nto keep in mind here.\n\nOftentimes, on television,\n\nthey show, for example, a patient's heart who's stopped\n\nand the monitor shows a flat line.\n\nYou actually can't use a defibrillator to restart\n\na patient's heart if they're flatlined.\n\nWhat you do use it for is when the bottom part of the heart,\n\nthese chambers of the heart, go into something\n\ncalled ventricular fibrillation.\n\nIn other words, they're not beating.\n\nThey're just quivering.\n\nAnd because these chambers are responsible\n\nfor pumping blood to the rest of the body,\n\nif they're not pumping,\n\nthe rest of the body ain't getting any blood.\n\nAnd so the external defibrillator that we use\n\nwhen someone has a cardiac arrest can basically restart\n\nthe heart and get it pumping again.\n\nBut you can't do it if the person's flatlined.\n\n@derapops asks: Is broken heart syndrome a real thing?\n\nAbsolutely, it's a real thing.\n\nIn fact, I just treated a patient\n\nwith broken heart syndrome this morning.\n\nIt's a situation where the heart all of a sudden\n\nstops working normally\n\nbecause of some kind of psychological stress.\n\nEven on the EKG,\n\nit can look like someone's having a heart attack.\n\nAnd when we look for blockages,\n\nwe find they don't have any blockages.\n\nBut the good news is that that recovers over time.\n\nThese patients often go on to have normal lifespans.\n\nBut absolutely, yes, broken heart syndrome is a thing\n\nand we're seeing more and more of it,\n\njust because of life stresses\n\nthat people are having these days.\n\n@kjewels71 asks: Will we ever learn what happened\n\nto Damar Hamlin...exactly what caused his cardiac arrest?\n\nSo Damar Hamlin, a professional football player,\n\nhe unfortunately had cardiac arrest during a game.\n\nAnd what happened to him is that he was hit in the chest\n\nat exactly the right time during the electrical activity\n\nof the heart so that his heart stopped.\n\nIt has to happen in such a specific time\n\nof what we call the cardiac cycle\n\nor during the normal heartbeat\n\nthat it is a very, very rare phenomenon.\n\nAnd thankfully, he's really become an advocate\n\nfor community education around CPR,\n\nso that if someone does have a cardiac arrest,\n\nthey can be resuscitated very, very quickly.\n\nIt's really important for all of us really\n\nto get educated about basic life support and CPR.\n\nSo rolls asks, i train and work out a [beep] ton\n\nwhy is my resting heart rate still fast asf?\n\nFirst of all, it may be that even though you're hitting\n\nthe gym a lot, maybe you're not doing enough cardio.\n\nYour heart rate when you're just resting\n\nshould be somewhere between 60 and 100.\n\nAnything below 60 is probably a little too slow,\n\nbut keeping in mind, marathon runners, for example,\n\nthey'll have very, very slow heartbeats.\n\nAnd that's normal for them.\n\nSo to find your own resting heart rate,\n\nwhat you wanna do is sit in a quiet room,\n\nfeel your pulse in your wrist or in your neck,\n\nand count the beats for six seconds.\n\nMultiply what number you get by 10,\n\nand that'll give you what your resting heart rate is\n\nin beats per minute.\n\nIf you're in pretty good shape,\n\nyou're exercising regularly,\n\nand your resting heart rate still is high,\n\nit's probably a good idea to see your doctor\n\nand just get checked out.\n\nitzkayshoe asks: Hey guys what are the signs\n\nof a heart attack?\n\nI can't feel my arms.\n\nWell, I'm not that if you can't feel your arms,\n\nthat's really the sign of a heart attack.\n\nThe classic symptoms of a heart attack are chest pressure\n\nor chest tightness.\n\nYou may feel shoulder pain\n\neither in your left shoulder or both shoulders.\n\nIt may radiate to your jaw.\n\nYou may feel jaw pain.\n\nWomen may have symptoms\n\nthat are a little bit different from men.\n\nThey may feel shortness of breath.\n\nThey may feel profound fatigue\n\nthat's really abnormal for them.\n\nA heart attack is when part of the heart muscle dies\n\nbecause the blood supply to that heart muscle\n\nhas been choked off.\n\nI have a picture for you here that shows\n\nthe blood vessels that supply the heart muscle.\n\nWhat you see here is there's a narrowing\n\nin that blood vessel,\n\nand that blood is not able to get past that blockage.\n\nThat's what causes the pain that people are feeling\n\nin their chest, and our job as cardiologists\n\nis to diagnosis this as quickly as we can,\n\ngo in there and actually open that blockage,\n\nwhich is exactly what we do\n\nwith balloon angioplasty and stents.\n\n@chicafromthechi asks, So does a low dose aspirin\n\nhelp prevent heart attacks or not?\n\nIf you don't have manifests of cardiovascular disease,\n\nit's really not recommended that you take an aspirin,\n\nspecifically if you're trying to prevent heart disease.\n\nIt doesn't prevent heart attacks\n\nand does put you at risk for bleeding complications,\n\nbecause aspirin can be directly irritating\n\nto the lining of the stomach.\n\nAspirin is a blood thinner.\n\nAnd because a heart attack involves blood clots\n\nthat are occurring inside the blood vessels of the heart,\n\naspirin can actually address those blood clots\n\nby actually breaking them up and reestablishing flow\n\nto the heart muscle.\n\nIf you have cardiovascular disease already,\n\naspirin can prevent future heart attacks\n\nby gently thinning your blood.\n\nOr if you're actively having a heart attack,\n\nit can treat a heart attack by breaking up the blood clot\n\nthat's causing it.\n\nBut if you don't have either one of those things,\n\nlow-dose aspirin really is not gonna prevent you\n\nfrom having a heart attack.\n\n@DoGsMoveSilent says: You get served this for breakfast.\n\nWhat's your reaction?\n\nMy reaction is, I probably didn't order this.\n\nBut let's take a look at what's on this plate.\n\nProcessed meats can be very, very high in saturated fat,\n\nbut they also might be high in salt.\n\nSo for example, the beans, which are a great source\n\nof protein and fiber, you know,\n\nthese beans might be from a can.\n\nAnd canned vegetables and canned beans do have\n\na lot of salt in them. For most of us, salt is fine.\n\nBut some of us do have what's called\n\nsalt-sensitive hypertension.\n\nAnd minimizing the amount of salt or sodium in our diet\n\ncan certainly protect you\n\nfrom developing high blood pressure.\n\nEggs are perfectly fine for you.\n\nThey're a great source of protein.\n\nYou should eat the yolk.\n\nYou know, one of the reasons that people said\n\nthat eggs were bad for you,\n\n'cause they said it was high in cholesterol.\n\nIt turns out that dietary cholesterol contributes\n\nvery, very little to your blood cholesterol.\n\nWhat does contribute to your blood cholesterol\n\nis saturated fat.\n\nAnd prepared appropriately,\n\neggs can be very low in saturated fat.\n\nI'll confess, I love French fries.\n\nBut anything that gets fried can increase saturated fat.\n\nSaturated fat in and of itself can increase\n\nyour blood cholesterol,\n\nand blood cholesterol is directly linked\n\nwith the development of heart disease like heart attacks.\n\n@BettyPhuck9 asks: How does covid affect your heart?\n\nWell, COVID has a lot of effects on the heart.\n\nThe viruses can infect the lining of the blood vessels,\n\nleading to blood clots forming and an increased risk\n\nof heart attack.\n\nCOVID-19 can also affect the heart muscle itself\n\nand weaken the heart muscle.\n\nDuring the pandemic, we saw an increased risk\n\nof heart attacks, so it's really, really important\n\nto try and avoid COVID-19 and prevent it if at all possible.\n\n@Batla_G asks: A 45 years old close relative has found 100\n\nand 95% blockage in two arteries\n\nand they're exploring options between Stents and Bye Pass.\n\nCan someone suggest what's less risky?\n\nWell, I'm sorry to hear that your relative's having issues.\n\nI certainly can't comment on their specific case,\n\nbut let's talk a little bit about stents and bypass surgery\n\nand what they do.\n\nSo a stent is just a wire mesh tube\n\nthat's made out of a specific type of metal\n\nthat goes inside the arteries of the heart muscle\n\nand props open blockages.\n\nIt may be a blockage\n\nthat's filled with cholesterol, for example.\n\nSo the stent is this metal part,\n\nand it comes crimped on this balloon.\n\nAnd this red tip is the end of the balloon catheter itself.\n\nOnce we position this on the X-ray in the right spot,\n\nwe can use this device\n\nand push saline, which is salt water,\n\nand expand that balloon.\n\nWhat I'll do is I'll turn this device\n\nand push that saline into this balloon.\n\nThere is goes.\n\nAnd it pops open that stent.\n\nI can then deflate the balloon\n\nand remove the balloon catheter\n\nand then leave the stent behind.\n\nSo that's how stents work.\n\nBut how does bypass surgery work?\n\nA surgeon will take blood vessels oftentimes\n\nfrom your legs or maybe from your arm\n\nand attach them to the aorta here\n\nand put it into an area that's past the blockage.\n\nThink of it as a blocked highway.\n\nSo if the highway is blocked,\n\noftentimes there's a bypass that goes around it.\n\nAround 12% of the patients with atherosclerosis\n\naffecting the heart get bypass surgery.\n\nAbout 65% or so get stents.\n\n@catgirlgale says: wtf is a cholesterol?\n\nWell, cholesterol is just a substance in your body\n\nthat's all over your body.\n\nIt's an integral part of the cell membranes\n\nthat make up your body.\n\nBut cholesterol also can float around in your body\n\nand cause blockages in the blood supply to the heart muscle,\n\nthe blood supply to your brain,\n\nthe blood supply to your legs.\n\nThere are different types of cholesterol.\n\nThere's good cholesterol and there's bad cholesterol.\n\nBad cholesterol's the one\n\nyou really oughta pay attention to.\n\nIt's also called LDL cholesterol.\n\nThat's the cholesterol that if it's too high\n\ncan cause heart attacks and strokes.\n\nIt's important to minimize the amount of LDL cholesterol\n\nthat's measured in your blood.\n\nExercise, minimizing the amount of saturated fat.\n\nThere are some very, very good and very, very safe medicines\n\nthat will allow you to lower your blood cholesterol.\n\nOne of the more common medications for cholesterol\n\nis something called LIPITOR.\n\nThe generic name is atorvastatin.\n\nIt's a very cheap drug.\n\nIt's incredibly effective and has been shown\n\nnot only to lower cholesterol safely\n\nbut also prevent heart attacks.\n\nlazzypoo asks: how does the human heart just do that?\n\nThe human heart is really pretty amazing.\n\nIt does a lotta things.\n\nIt pumps 100,000 times a day.\n\nIt pumps 2,000 gallons of blood\n\nthrough nearly 60,000 miles of blood vessels.\n\nIt's got these blood vessels that are going into it\n\nand coming out of it.\n\nNow, they're not really this color inside the body,\n\nbut these blue blood vessels are carrying blood\n\nthat needs oxygen.\n\nThe organs in your body have already used the oxygen.\n\nThey're sending it back to the heart.\n\nIt comes in through this right side of the heart,\n\nand these white structures here are valves\n\nthat open and close and allow the blood to flow through.\n\nAnd then it pumps through the right side\n\nand goes to the lungs where it can pick up the oxygen\n\nthat we're breathing.\n\nAnd that blood then comes back\n\nto the left side of the heart.\n\nAnd the left side of the heart pumps it\n\nthrough this giant blood vessel that you can see here\n\ncalled the aorta.\n\nFrom the aorta, there are all kinds of branches\n\nthat go to all the organs throughout the body.\n\nAnd they can then get the oxygen that they need\n\nfor normal functioning.\n\n@SarahBarleyMc asks: Can anyone tell me\n\nhow Heart Rate Variability impacts on your health?\n\nHeart rate variability is just the normal variation\n\nin our heart rate during the day.\n\nA lot of consumer goods are measuring things\n\nlike heart rate variability.\n\nThe reason that heart rate variability is important is\n\nthat it's an indicator of a healthy heart.\n\nBecause if you're getting excited, for example,\n\nyour heart rate should go up.\n\nIf you're relaxed, your heart rate should come down.\n\nIf your heart rate is unable to maintain\n\nthat kind of variability,\n\nit's a sign that something may be abnormal\n\nwith your cardiovascular health.\n\nProbably the thing that matters a little bit more\n\nthan heart rate variability is what's called\n\nheart rate recovery.\n\nSo for example, if you're exercising,\n\nhow fast does your heart rate return back to normal?\n\nYour heart rate probably should come back\n\nto 90% of your resting heart rate\n\nafter you stop exercising within two to three minutes.\n\nIf it's taking longer than that,\n\nyou can actually improve your heart rate recovery\n\nby continuing to exercise.\n\n@rosamarei asks: wtf is a heart murmur\n\nand why do I have it?\n\nWell, a heart murmur is just a sound\n\nthat your cardiologist or your doctor hears\n\nwhen they listen to your heart with a stethoscope.\n\nHere's what a normal heartbeat should sound like.\n\n[heart beating]\n\nAnd if you have a heart murmur, that's an extra sound.\n\nSo if you have aortic stenosis or a narrowing\n\nof the aortic valve, for example,\n\nthat sounds a little bit like this.\n\n[heart beating]\n\nSome murmurs do develop when you're a child,\n\nand they go away.\n\nSome murmurs, you may not have until you get older.\n\nAs we get older, our heart valves,\n\nthey're just a little bit stiffer than when we were younger.\n\nAnd that can cause a heart murmur.\n\nBut again, it's completely normal\n\nin that particular setting.\n\n@EvieeMcLovin asks: how do pacemakers worq?\n\nSo your heart itself has pacemakers.\n\nThe muscle of the heart has in it electrical fibers.\n\nSo it can continue to beat regularly\n\nto pump the blood to the organs\n\nso that they can get the blood that they need.\n\nSometimes, as we get older, for example,\n\nthose pacemakers stop working,\n\nand we have to put in what's called an external pacemaker.\n\nThis is a pacemaker, and as you can see,\n\nit's very, very small.\n\nThese wires will plug into this pacemaker battery,\n\nand it goes just under your skin on the left side\n\nof your heart.\n\nAnd then, those wires will actually go inside the heart.\n\nThe pacemaker itself will take over the pacing function\n\nof the heart.\n\nIt will actually send out a regular electrical signal\n\nthrough these wires.\n\nAnd those wires will deliver that electrical signal\n\nto the heart muscle itself and allow the heart\n\nto beat normally.\n\n@CarperG64 asks: How do fit athletes\n\nhave heart attacks at 23 yet people drink,\n\neat badly and live to 90+ and never have a heart problem?\n\nThe reality is, some of heart disease\n\nis determined through genetics.\n\nAnd we can't choose who our parents are,\n\nand heart disease does run in families.\n\nSome of the reasons why a young person\n\ncould have a heart attack could be\n\nbecause they have some genetic issue with their cholesterol,\n\nsomething called familial hypercholesterolemia.\n\nThat just means that there's a genetic abnormality\n\nthat makes their cholesterol really, really, really high.\n\nThere are some other very rare conditions,\n\nsomething called spontaneous coronary artery dissection,\n\nwhere the linings of the blood vessels\n\nthat supply the heart muscle themselves tear.\n\nAnd that can cause a blockage in the blood flow.\n\nThose are really unusual circumstances,\n\nand really, for all of us,\n\nwe should be following a healthy lifestyle.\n\n@user_1_1 asks: Is it true that there's a correlation\n\nbetween gum health and heart health?\n\nYes, there is a correlation between gum health\n\nand heart health.\n\nWe know that patients who have terrible gum disease\n\nare at a higher risk for having cardiovascular disease.\n\nIt might just be coincidence, but you know,\n\nit's probably a good idea to maintain both\n\ngood cardiovascular health and good gum health.\n\n@IreneChosen asks: What diet is best\n\nfor reversing heart disease?\n\nThere are some studies that suggest\n\na plant-based diet can reverse heart disease.\n\nThe downside with a plant-based diet\n\nis it can be very, very difficult to follow and adhere to.\n\nBut there are some principles that are important to follow.\n\nIncreasing the amount of fiber in your diet\n\nis really, really important.\n\nTry to make sure that you have four grams of fiber\n\nfor every 100 calories that you're eating.\n\nMinimizing the amount of saturated fats\n\nso that it makes up less than 20%\n\nof the overall caloric intake.\n\n@ThatCapeVerdean says: Show me how alcohol\n\nand cigarettes affect the heart.\n\nWell, I can't really show you,\n\nbecause alcohol and cigarettes affect the heart really\n\nover a lifetime of use.\n\nIf you're someone who's really drinking a lot,\n\nthat can affect the heart abnormally\n\nbecause it can weaken the heart muscle itself\n\nand predispose you to having something\n\ncalled congestive heart failure.\n\nAlcohol itself in large doses is toxic to the heart muscle.\n\nCigarettes work a little bit differently.\n\nAt least seven years of smoking is really what it takes\n\nto really affect the heart.\n\nAnd what cigarettes do is,\n\nthe nicotine itself can directly damage the lining\n\nof the blood vessels.\n\nThen cholesterol starts getting attracted to that area,\n\nand it starts building up.\n\nAnd it can predispose you to having a heart attack.\n\nCigarettes also can increase your blood pressure.\n\nAnd increased blood pressure makes it harder\n\nfor your heart to pump its blood to the organs\n\nthat need the oxygen.\n\n@ElidhGant says: High blood pressure means\n\nyour heart pumps harder to circulate blood.\n\nExercise means your heart pumps harder to circulate blood.\n\nI'm confused, why is one bad and the other good?\n\nWhen your blood pressure goes up during exercise,\n\nafter you stop exercising, it comes back down to normal.\n\nIn fact, if you exercise regularly,\n\nlong-term, your blood pressure's actually lower\n\nbecause it's good for your heart.\n\nThe other term for high blood pressure is the silent killer.\n\nBecause you feel fine,\n\nbut your blood pressure is high.\n\nAnd it sets you up for all kinds of bad things.\n\nA stroke, it can lead to heart failure\n\nbecause your heart is pumping so hard\n\nand eventually just sort of tires out and weakens.\n\nHigh blood pressure as a disease is very, very different\n\nfrom blood pressure transiently going up\n\nand coming back down during exercise.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nThanks for watching Heart Support.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']",

{"title": "Cardiologist Answers Heart Questions From Twitter | Tech Support", "text": "Transcript\n\nI'm Sunil Rao, a cardiologist at NYU Langone Health.\n\nLet's answer some questions from the internet.\n\nThis is Heart Support.\n\n[upbeat rhythmic music]\n\n@ThiggyMan asks: Ay...\n\nWhat heart rate is considered too high?\n\nThere's no one number\n\nthat's considered too high for everyone.\n\nIf you have a fever, if you have the flu,\n\nyour heart rate may go up to 120, 130,\n\nand that's probably, quote, too high for you.\n\nLet's say you're on the treadmill and you're wondering,\n\nGosh, how high should my heart rate get?\n\nWell, there's a rule of thumb that you can remember.\n\n220 minus your age.\n\nSo let's say you're 40 years old.\n\nThat would equal 180 beats per minute,\n\nwhich would be really the maximum heart rate\n\nthat you're aiming for.\n\nReally what you wanna do is try to get\n\nto about 70 to 85% of that heart rate,\n\nwhich would be somewhere between 145\n\nand 155 beats per minute while you're exercising.\n\nIf you notice that your heart rate's going above 180,\n\nyou probably oughta cut back a little bit.\n\ntehRisa asks: I need a doctor to tell me medically\n\nwhat is happening in my chest when my heart skips a beat\n\nwhile reading a cute romance manga.\n\nOccasionally what will happen is that the heart\n\nwill have a beat that occurs prematurely.\n\nWell, the heart has a way to compensate for that.\n\nIt has a pause,\n\nand then it gets back on rhythm.\n\nIt's that pause that you're feeling\n\nwhen you say your heart is skipping a beat.\n\nMany of us have occasional skipped beats that happen.\n\nMaybe we had a little too much caffeine that day.\n\nMaybe we're nervous about a job interview,\n\nnervous about a first date.\n\nThat's very, very common.\n\nBut if you notice that your heart is skipping beats a lot,\n\nyou may have what's called an arrhythmia.\n\nArrhythmia's just a general term\n\nthat says there's something wrong\n\nwith the electrical system:\n\natrial fibrillation, atrial flutter,\n\nventricular tachycardia, there are a whole bunch\n\nof other things that can be diagnosed very, very easily\n\nby getting an EKG.\n\nOkay, so next question.\n\nEKGs, how do they work?\n\nEKG is an electrocardiogram.\n\nHere's a normal EKG.\n\nAnd you can see that these lines are occurring\n\nat a very regular interval.\n\nAnd the baseline has a few curves on it,\n\nbut those curves are pretty much the same\n\nwith every single beat that's happening.\n\nThat's a normal EKG.\n\nAnd what does an abnormal EKG look like?\n\nFirst of all, these deflections that are going up and down\n\nare occurring very, very irregularly.\n\nLook at the spaces between these deflections.\n\nYou see how there's so many different waveforms here?\n\nThere are lots of lumps and bumps.\n\nThis is an EKG of a person who has something\n\ncalled atrial fibrillation.\n\nAnd that's when the top chambers\n\nof the heart beat irregularly.\n\nSo let's go to our heart model.\n\nSo there are the upper chambers of the heart,\n\nand there are the lower chambers of the heart.\n\nWhen someone has atrial fibrillation,\n\nthe top chambers of the heart stop beating.\n\nAnd that's that irregular waveform\n\nthat you pick up on the EKG.\n\nThe problem with that is that the blood can pool\n\nin parts of the heart.\n\nAnd if it forms a blood clot,\n\nno matter how tiny it might be inside the heart,\n\nand that blood clot travels to your brain,\n\nit can put you at risk for having a stroke.\n\n@ChicagoSeavey asks: Guys I can hear my heartbeat...\n\nWithout a stethoscope????\n\nIs that normal???\n\nIt's very, very common to hear your heartbeat in your ear.\n\nSo a lotta people can hear it when they're laying down\n\nand when they're going to sleep.\n\nYou may be even be hearing the blood going\n\nthrough the blood vessels in your neck.\n\nSome people hear it, some people don't.\n\nThat's a very, very common finding\n\nand really nothing to worry about.\n\n@BaseballMurse7 asks: True or false:\n\nyou can restart the heart with a defibrillator?\n\nWell, that's true, you can.\n\nNow, there are a couple things that are important\n\nto keep in mind here.\n\nOftentimes, on television,\n\nthey show, for example, a patient's heart who's stopped\n\nand the monitor shows a flat line.\n\nYou actually can't use a defibrillator to restart\n\na patient's heart if they're flatlined.\n\nWhat you do use it for is when the bottom part of the heart,\n\nthese chambers of the heart, go into something\n\ncalled ventricular fibrillation.\n\nIn other words, they're not beating.\n\nThey're just quivering.\n\nAnd because these chambers are responsible\n\nfor pumping blood to the rest of the body,\n\nif they're not pumping,\n\nthe rest of the body ain't getting any blood.\n\nAnd so the external defibrillator that we use\n\nwhen someone has a cardiac arrest can basically restart\n\nthe heart and get it pumping again.\n\nBut you can't do it if the person's flatlined.\n\n@derapops asks: Is broken heart syndrome a real thing?\n\nAbsolutely, it's a real thing.\n\nIn fact, I just treated a patient\n\nwith broken heart syndrome this morning.\n\nIt's a situation where the heart all of a sudden\n\nstops working normally\n\nbecause of some kind of psychological stress.\n\nEven on the EKG,\n\nit can look like someone's having a heart attack.\n\nAnd when we look for blockages,\n\nwe find they don't have any blockages.\n\nBut the good news is that that recovers over time.\n\nThese patients often go on to have normal lifespans.\n\nBut absolutely, yes, broken heart syndrome is a thing\n\nand we're seeing more and more of it,\n\njust because of life stresses\n\nthat people are having these days.\n\n@kjewels71 asks: Will we ever learn what happened\n\nto Damar Hamlin...exactly what caused his cardiac arrest?\n\nSo Damar Hamlin, a professional football player,\n\nhe unfortunately had cardiac arrest during a game.\n\nAnd what happened to him is that he was hit in the chest\n\nat exactly the right time during the electrical activity\n\nof the heart so that his heart stopped.\n\nIt has to happen in such a specific time\n\nof what we call the cardiac cycle\n\nor during the normal heartbeat\n\nthat it is a very, very rare phenomenon.\n\nAnd thankfully, he's really become an advocate\n\nfor community education around CPR,\n\nso that if someone does have a cardiac arrest,\n\nthey can be resuscitated very, very quickly.\n\nIt's really important for all of us really\n\nto get educated about basic life support and CPR.\n\nSo rolls asks, i train and work out a [beep] ton\n\nwhy is my resting heart rate still fast asf?\n\nFirst of all, it may be that even though you're hitting\n\nthe gym a lot, maybe you're not doing enough cardio.\n\nYour heart rate when you're just resting\n\nshould be somewhere between 60 and 100.\n\nAnything below 60 is probably a little too slow,\n\nbut keeping in mind, marathon runners, for example,\n\nthey'll have very, very slow heartbeats.\n\nAnd that's normal for them.\n\nSo to find your own resting heart rate,\n\nwhat you wanna do is sit in a quiet room,\n\nfeel your pulse in your wrist or in your neck,\n\nand count the beats for six seconds.\n\nMultiply what number you get by 10,\n\nand that'll give you what your resting heart rate is\n\nin beats per minute.\n\nIf you're in pretty good shape,\n\nyou're exercising regularly,\n\nand your resting heart rate still is high,\n\nit's probably a good idea to see your doctor\n\nand just get checked out.\n\nitzkayshoe asks: Hey guys what are the signs\n\nof a heart attack?\n\nI can't feel my arms.\n\nWell, I'm not that if you can't feel your arms,\n\nthat's really the sign of a heart attack.\n\nThe classic symptoms of a heart attack are chest pressure\n\nor chest tightness.\n\nYou may feel shoulder pain\n\neither in your left shoulder or both shoulders.\n\nIt may radiate to your jaw.\n\nYou may feel jaw pain.\n\nWomen may have symptoms\n\nthat are a little bit different from men.\n\nThey may feel shortness of breath.\n\nThey may feel profound fatigue\n\nthat's really abnormal for them.\n\nA heart attack is when part of the heart muscle dies\n\nbecause the blood supply to that heart muscle\n\nhas been choked off.\n\nI have a picture for you here that shows\n\nthe blood vessels that supply the heart muscle.\n\nWhat you see here is there's a narrowing\n\nin that blood vessel,\n\nand that blood is not able to get past that blockage.\n\nThat's what causes the pain that people are feeling\n\nin their chest, and our job as cardiologists\n\nis to diagnosis this as quickly as we can,\n\ngo in there and actually open that blockage,\n\nwhich is exactly what we do\n\nwith balloon angioplasty and stents.\n\n@chicafromthechi asks, So does a low dose aspirin\n\nhelp prevent heart attacks or not?\n\nIf you don't have manifests of cardiovascular disease,\n\nit's really not recommended that you take an aspirin,\n\nspecifically if you're trying to prevent heart disease.\n\nIt doesn't prevent heart attacks\n\nand does put you at risk for bleeding complications,\n\nbecause aspirin can be directly irritating\n\nto the lining of the stomach.\n\nAspirin is a blood thinner.\n\nAnd because a heart attack involves blood clots\n\nthat are occurring inside the blood vessels of the heart,\n\naspirin can actually address those blood clots\n\nby actually breaking them up and reestablishing flow\n\nto the heart muscle.\n\nIf you have cardiovascular disease already,\n\naspirin can prevent future heart attacks\n\nby gently thinning your blood.\n\nOr if you're actively having a heart attack,\n\nit can treat a heart attack by breaking up the blood clot\n\nthat's causing it.\n\nBut if you don't have either one of those things,\n\nlow-dose aspirin really is not gonna prevent you\n\nfrom having a heart attack.\n\n@DoGsMoveSilent says: You get served this for breakfast.\n\nWhat's your reaction?\n\nMy reaction is, I probably didn't order this.\n\nBut let's take a look at what's on this plate.\n\nProcessed meats can be very, very high in saturated fat,\n\nbut they also might be high in salt.\n\nSo for example, the beans, which are a great source\n\nof protein and fiber, you know,\n\nthese beans might be from a can.\n\nAnd canned vegetables and canned beans do have\n\na lot of salt in them. For most of us, salt is fine.\n\nBut some of us do have what's called\n\nsalt-sensitive hypertension.\n\nAnd minimizing the amount of salt or sodium in our diet\n\ncan certainly protect you\n\nfrom developing high blood pressure.\n\nEggs are perfectly fine for you.\n\nThey're a great source of protein.\n\nYou should eat the yolk.\n\nYou know, one of the reasons that people said\n\nthat eggs were bad for you,\n\n'cause they said it was high in cholesterol.\n\nIt turns out that dietary cholesterol contributes\n\nvery, very little to your blood cholesterol.\n\nWhat does contribute to your blood cholesterol\n\nis saturated fat.\n\nAnd prepared appropriately,\n\neggs can be very low in saturated fat.\n\nI'll confess, I love French fries.\n\nBut anything that gets fried can increase saturated fat.\n\nSaturated fat in and of itself can increase\n\nyour blood cholesterol,\n\nand blood cholesterol is directly linked\n\nwith the development of heart disease like heart attacks.\n\n@BettyPhuck9 asks: How does covid affect your heart?\n\nWell, COVID has a lot of effects on the heart.\n\nThe viruses can infect the lining of the blood vessels,\n\nleading to blood clots forming and an increased risk\n\nof heart attack.\n\nCOVID-19 can also affect the heart muscle itself\n\nand weaken the heart muscle.\n\nDuring the pandemic, we saw an increased risk\n\nof heart attacks, so it's really, really important\n\nto try and avoid COVID-19 and prevent it if at all possible.\n\n@Batla_G asks: A 45 years old close relative has found 100\n\nand 95% blockage in two arteries\n\nand they're exploring options between Stents and Bye Pass.\n\nCan someone suggest what's less risky?\n\nWell, I'm sorry to hear that your relative's having issues.\n\nI certainly can't comment on their specific case,\n\nbut let's talk a little bit about stents and bypass surgery\n\nand what they do.\n\nSo a stent is just a wire mesh tube\n\nthat's made out of a specific type of metal\n\nthat goes inside the arteries of the heart muscle\n\nand props open blockages.\n\nIt may be a blockage\n\nthat's filled with cholesterol, for example.\n\nSo the stent is this metal part,\n\nand it comes crimped on this balloon.\n\nAnd this red tip is the end of the balloon catheter itself.\n\nOnce we position this on the X-ray in the right spot,\n\nwe can use this device\n\nand push saline, which is salt water,\n\nand expand that balloon.\n\nWhat I'll do is I'll turn this device\n\nand push that saline into this balloon.\n\nThere is goes.\n\nAnd it pops open that stent.\n\nI can then deflate the balloon\n\nand remove the balloon catheter\n\nand then leave the stent behind.\n\nSo that's how stents work.\n\nBut how does bypass surgery work?\n\nA surgeon will take blood vessels oftentimes\n\nfrom your legs or maybe from your arm\n\nand attach them to the aorta here\n\nand put it into an area that's past the blockage.\n\nThink of it as a blocked highway.\n\nSo if the highway is blocked,\n\noftentimes there's a bypass that goes around it.\n\nAround 12% of the patients with atherosclerosis\n\naffecting the heart get bypass surgery.\n\nAbout 65% or so get stents.\n\n@catgirlgale says: wtf is a cholesterol?\n\nWell, cholesterol is just a substance in your body\n\nthat's all over your body.\n\nIt's an integral part of the cell membranes\n\nthat make up your body.\n\nBut cholesterol also can float around in your body\n\nand cause blockages in the blood supply to the heart muscle,\n\nthe blood supply to your brain,\n\nthe blood supply to your legs.\n\nThere are different types of cholesterol.\n\nThere's good cholesterol and there's bad cholesterol.\n\nBad cholesterol's the one\n\nyou really oughta pay attention to.\n\nIt's also called LDL cholesterol.\n\nThat's the cholesterol that if it's too high\n\ncan cause heart attacks and strokes.\n\nIt's important to minimize the amount of LDL cholesterol\n\nthat's measured in your blood.\n\nExercise, minimizing the amount of saturated fat.\n\nThere are some very, very good and very, very safe medicines\n\nthat will allow you to lower your blood cholesterol.\n\nOne of the more common medications for cholesterol\n\nis something called LIPITOR.\n\nThe generic name is atorvastatin.\n\nIt's a very cheap drug.\n\nIt's incredibly effective and has been shown\n\nnot only to lower cholesterol safely\n\nbut also prevent heart attacks.\n\nlazzypoo asks: how does the human heart just do that?\n\nThe human heart is really pretty amazing.\n\nIt does a lotta things.\n\nIt pumps 100,000 times a day.\n\nIt pumps 2,000 gallons of blood\n\nthrough nearly 60,000 miles of blood vessels.\n\nIt's got these blood vessels that are going into it\n\nand coming out of it.\n\nNow, they're not really this color inside the body,\n\nbut these blue blood vessels are carrying blood\n\nthat needs oxygen.\n\nThe organs in your body have already used the oxygen.\n\nThey're sending it back to the heart.\n\nIt comes in through this right side of the heart,\n\nand these white structures here are valves\n\nthat open and close and allow the blood to flow through.\n\nAnd then it pumps through the right side\n\nand goes to the lungs where it can pick up the oxygen\n\nthat we're breathing.\n\nAnd that blood then comes back\n\nto the left side of the heart.\n\nAnd the left side of the heart pumps it\n\nthrough this giant blood vessel that you can see here\n\ncalled the aorta.\n\nFrom the aorta, there are all kinds of branches\n\nthat go to all the organs throughout the body.\n\nAnd they can then get the oxygen that they need\n\nfor normal functioning.\n\n@SarahBarleyMc asks: Can anyone tell me\n\nhow Heart Rate Variability impacts on your health?\n\nHeart rate variability is just the normal variation\n\nin our heart rate during the day.\n\nA lot of consumer goods are measuring things\n\nlike heart rate variability.\n\nThe reason that heart rate variability is important is\n\nthat it's an indicator of a healthy heart.\n\nBecause if you're getting excited, for example,\n\nyour heart rate should go up.\n\nIf you're relaxed, your heart rate should come down.\n\nIf your heart rate is unable to maintain\n\nthat kind of variability,\n\nit's a sign that something may be abnormal\n\nwith your cardiovascular health.\n\nProbably the thing that matters a little bit more\n\nthan heart rate variability is what's called\n\nheart rate recovery.\n\nSo for example, if you're exercising,\n\nhow fast does your heart rate return back to normal?\n\nYour heart rate probably should come back\n\nto 90% of your resting heart rate\n\nafter you stop exercising within two to three minutes.\n\nIf it's taking longer than that,\n\nyou can actually improve your heart rate recovery\n\nby continuing to exercise.\n\n@rosamarei asks: wtf is a heart murmur\n\nand why do I have it?\n\nWell, a heart murmur is just a sound\n\nthat your cardiologist or your doctor hears\n\nwhen they listen to your heart with a stethoscope.\n\nHere's what a normal heartbeat should sound like.\n\n[heart beating]\n\nAnd if you have a heart murmur, that's an extra sound.\n\nSo if you have aortic stenosis or a narrowing\n\nof the aortic valve, for example,\n\nthat sounds a little bit like this.\n\n[heart beating]\n\nSome murmurs do develop when you're a child,\n\nand they go away.\n\nSome murmurs, you may not have until you get older.\n\nAs we get older, our heart valves,\n\nthey're just a little bit stiffer than when we were younger.\n\nAnd that can cause a heart murmur.\n\nBut again, it's completely normal\n\nin that particular setting.\n\n@EvieeMcLovin asks: how do pacemakers worq?\n\nSo your heart itself has pacemakers.\n\nThe muscle of the heart has in it electrical fibers.\n\nSo it can continue to beat regularly\n\nto pump the blood to the organs\n\nso that they can get the blood that they need.\n\nSometimes, as we get older, for example,\n\nthose pacemakers stop working,\n\nand we have to put in what's called an external pacemaker.\n\nThis is a pacemaker, and as you can see,\n\nit's very, very small.\n\nThese wires will plug into this pacemaker battery,\n\nand it goes just under your skin on the left side\n\nof your heart.\n\nAnd then, those wires will actually go inside the heart.\n\nThe pacemaker itself will take over the pacing function\n\nof the heart.\n\nIt will actually send out a regular electrical signal\n\nthrough these wires.\n\nAnd those wires will deliver that electrical signal\n\nto the heart muscle itself and allow the heart\n\nto beat normally.\n\n@CarperG64 asks: How do fit athletes\n\nhave heart attacks at 23 yet people drink,\n\neat badly and live to 90+ and never have a heart problem?\n\nThe reality is, some of heart disease\n\nis determined through genetics.\n\nAnd we can't choose who our parents are,\n\nand heart disease does run in families.\n\nSome of the reasons why a young person\n\ncould have a heart attack could be\n\nbecause they have some genetic issue with their cholesterol,\n\nsomething called familial hypercholesterolemia.\n\nThat just means that there's a genetic abnormality\n\nthat makes their cholesterol really, really, really high.\n\nThere are some other very rare conditions,\n\nsomething called spontaneous coronary artery dissection,\n\nwhere the linings of the blood vessels\n\nthat supply the heart muscle themselves tear.\n\nAnd that can cause a blockage in the blood flow.\n\nThose are really unusual circumstances,\n\nand really, for all of us,\n\nwe should be following a healthy lifestyle.\n\n@user_1_1 asks: Is it true that there's a correlation\n\nbetween gum health and heart health?\n\nYes, there is a correlation between gum health\n\nand heart health.\n\nWe know that patients who have terrible gum disease\n\nare at a higher risk for having cardiovascular disease.\n\nIt might just be coincidence, but you know,\n\nit's probably a good idea to maintain both\n\ngood cardiovascular health and good gum health.\n\n@IreneChosen asks: What diet is best\n\nfor reversing heart disease?\n\nThere are some studies that suggest\n\na plant-based diet can reverse heart disease.\n\nThe downside with a plant-based diet\n\nis it can be very, very difficult to follow and adhere to.\n\nBut there are some principles that are important to follow.\n\nIncreasing the amount of fiber in your diet\n\nis really, really important.\n\nTry to make sure that you have four grams of fiber\n\nfor every 100 calories that you're eating.\n\nMinimizing the amount of saturated fats\n\nso that it makes up less than 20%\n\nof the overall caloric intake.\n\n@ThatCapeVerdean says: Show me how alcohol\n\nand cigarettes affect the heart.\n\nWell, I can't really show you,\n\nbecause alcohol and cigarettes affect the heart really\n\nover a lifetime of use.\n\nIf you're someone who's really drinking a lot,\n\nthat can affect the heart abnormally\n\nbecause it can weaken the heart muscle itself\n\nand predispose you to having something\n\ncalled congestive heart failure.\n\nAlcohol itself in large doses is toxic to the heart muscle.\n\nCigarettes work a little bit differently.\n\nAt least seven years of smoking is really what it takes\n\nto really affect the heart.\n\nAnd what cigarettes do is,\n\nthe nicotine itself can directly damage the lining\n\nof the blood vessels.\n\nThen cholesterol starts getting attracted to that area,\n\nand it starts building up.\n\nAnd it can predispose you to having a heart attack.\n\nCigarettes also can increase your blood pressure.\n\nAnd increased blood pressure makes it harder\n\nfor your heart to pump its blood to the organs\n\nthat need the oxygen.\n\n@ElidhGant says: High blood pressure means\n\nyour heart pumps harder to circulate blood.\n\nExercise means your heart pumps harder to circulate blood.\n\nI'm confused, why is one bad and the other good?\n\nWhen your blood pressure goes up during exercise,\n\nafter you stop exercising, it comes back down to normal.\n\nIn fact, if you exercise regularly,\n\nlong-term, your blood pressure's actually lower\n\nbecause it's good for your heart.\n\nThe other term for high blood pressure is the silent killer.\n\nBecause you feel fine,\n\nbut your blood pressure is high.\n\nAnd it sets you up for all kinds of bad things.\n\nA stroke, it can lead to heart failure\n\nbecause your heart is pumping so hard\n\nand eventually just sort of tires out and weakens.\n\nHigh blood pressure as a disease is very, very different\n\nfrom blood pressure transiently going up\n\nand coming back down during exercise.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nThanks for watching Heart Support.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']",

{"title": "Egyptologist Answers Ancient Egypt Questions From Twitter", "text": "Transcript\n\nI'm Professor Laurel Bestock.\n\nLet's answer some questions from the internet.\n\nThis is Egyptology Support.\n\n[light upbeat music]\n\n@FHHuntress asks,\n\nWhen did Ancient Egypt begin exactly according to you?\n\nAncient Egypt's really old.\n\nIf we talk about when the first king of Egypt\n\nactually became king,\n\nwe're talking about 3000 BC.\n\nAnd then we put ourselves on this timeline,\n\nthat would be an even 5,000 years.\n\nSo this then would be when we change from BC to AD,\n\nand we could say,\n\nyou know, Cleopatra's really close to that.\n\nSo the pyramids at Giza are about 2400 BC.\n\nNot only are we closer in time to Cleopatra\n\nthan Cleopatra is to the beginning\n\nof ancient Egyptian Pharaonic history,\n\nthere's even more time\n\nbetween Cleopatra and the pyramids\n\nthan there is between Cleopatra and us.\n\nAncient Egypt was already ancient in ancient Egypt.\n\n@Tsunaze asks, Seriously, how did the Sphinx's nose break?\n\nOur best evidence for how the nose of the Sphinx got broken\n\ncomes from a 15th-century Arabic historian,\n\nand he explains that someone who was angry\n\nactually deliberately shot the nose off the Sphinx\n\nbecause he was upset\n\nthat people were revering this monument from ancient Egypt.\n\nThis person was subsequently lynched by other local people\n\nwho revered the Sphinx.\n\nSo there are also stories\n\nthat Napoleon's army shot the nose off the Sphinx.\n\nWe think that one's probably not right,\n\nin part because we have drawings of the Sphinx\n\nfrom earlier than Napoleon's expedition,\n\nand the nose is already missing.\n\nThe Sphinx depicts the King Khafre.\n\nKhafre, a king of the Fourth Dynasty,\n\nbuilt the second largest pyramid at Giza.\n\n@SilentUschi asks,\n\nSo what did ancient Egyptians talk like?\n\nLike, what did it sound like?\n\nHieroglyphics ain't speech.\n\nWe know a great deal\n\nabout what Egyptian sounded like\n\nin part because the last stage\n\nof the ancient Egyptian language, Coptic,\n\nwas both written in Greek letters\n\nwhich we can still read,\n\nand in fact it's still the liturgical language\n\nof the Coptic Church.\n\nAnd so if you can go watch The Mummy,\n\nyou can hear much of what ancient Egypt sounded like.\n\n[speaking Egyptian]\n\nWe are able to phonetically reconstruct\n\nwhat it sounded like.\n\n[sword unsheathes]\n\nImhotep?\n\nAll mummy movies have somebody named Imhotep.\n\nImhotep was the architect\n\nresponsible for designing the first pyramid built in Egypt.\n\n@wildyouthstyles asks,\n\nWhat are some ancient Egyptian medicine and tools\n\nthey created that are used to this day?\n\nAncient Egyptian medicine was pretty advanced.\n\nWe know, for instance,\n\nthat they performed surgery\n\nto relieve pressure on the brain.\n\nWe have things, for instance,\n\nlike pregnancy tests in ancient Egypt.\n\nA woman who wants to know if she's pregnant\n\nand wants to know what the sex of the baby will be\n\nshould pee on both barley and wheat seeds.\n\nIf she's pregnant, these are gonna sprout,\n\nand which one sprouts first\n\nis gonna tell her whether she's gonna have a girl or a boy.\n\nAnd modern tests on this\n\nhave suggested that in fact the human growth hormone\n\nthat is so increased in pregnant women\n\ndoes have an effect on the germination of grain.\n\n@PPufnstuf asks, Did ancient Egypt have bars and [beep]?\n\nNo, ancient Egypt didn't have bars,\n\nbut the Egyptians were definitely very social,\n\nand alcohol was part of their social lives.\n\nWe know that the Egyptians drank a ton of beer\n\nand quite a bit of wine as well.\n\nThis was mostly done in homes and even in tombs.\n\nThe underground part of the tomb\n\nmight be where your burial chamber is,\n\nbut the above ground part of the tomb is a party palace.\n\nThere's a festival called the Beautiful Feast of the Valley\n\nwhere the whole point was to go get drunk in the tombs\n\nwith your ancestors.\n\nIn order to make beer and wine,\n\nwe have large scale breweries in towns\n\nfrom even before the first king of Egypt\n\nwas present in 3000 BC.\n\n@Princesa_de_NY asks,\n\nWatching this video in class\n\nabout what did ancient Egypt look like,\n\nand I'm pretty sure it's just scene clips\n\nfrom Assassin's Creed: Origins.\n\nSo when we check out the Assassin's Creed: Origins trailer,\n\nthere's a lot in there that's accurate\n\nfrom the landscape itself.\n\nThis sort of green strip around the Nile,\n\nthen cliffs and desert a little bit farther away.\n\nAnd the monuments are very accurately reconstructed.\n\nYou can see the pyramid with a funny-shaped top.\n\nThat's what we call the Bent Pyramid\n\nat a site called Dahshur.\n\nThat pyramid is actually built by the father of Khufu,\n\nthe guy who built the Great Pyramid.\n\nThe reason that is bent is because this is very early\n\nin the history of constructing pyramids.\n\nThey were still figuring out how to build perfect pyramids,\n\nand we think that this one cracked\n\nwhile it was under construction,\n\nand they changed the angle\n\nso that the weight at the top would not be as great.\n\n@rednym asks, How did King Tut manage to be so popular\n\neven though he lived such a short life?\n\nKing Tut is super popular with us\n\nbecause his tomb was found intact.\n\nThe discovery of King Tut's tomb\n\nwas one of the archeological wonders of the world.\n\nIf you go see this stuff in Cairo,\n\nit takes up so many rooms.\n\nYou have chariots,\n\nyou have shrines after shrines after shrines,\n\nnested shrines built around the body of the king\n\nwho's buried not just in one gold coffin\n\nbut in multiple gold coffins.\n\nThe beautiful face mask, also in gold,\n\ninlaid with precious stones that's on top of him.\n\nBut King Tut wasn't that popular in ancient Egypt.\n\nHe lived at a time\n\nthat later Egyptians, in fact, wrote out of history.\n\nSo he was the successor of a king\n\nwho is sometimes referred to as the heretic king Akhenaten,\n\nwho introduced a monotheistic religion in ancient Egypt.\n\nAnd Tutankhamen as one of the kings\n\nwho returned ancient Egypt\n\nto its original polytheistic religion\n\nand opened the temples again.\n\nThe fact that he was short-lived,\n\nnot well-known in later Egypt,\n\nprobably contributed to the fact\n\nthat his tomb was preserved.\n\nNobody thought to look for it.\n\n@KBrownks2 asks,\n\nDid you know that we can't recreate the Egyptian pyramids\n\nwith modern-day technology?\n\nWell guess that means,\n\nmaybe we weren't the most advanced\n\nthe human species has ever been.\n\nWe absolutely have the technology to recreate the pyramids.\n\nThe tools that the Egyptians were using\n\nto create these big stone blocks to make the pyramid\n\nwere of two types.\n\nRough stone balls,\n\na very hard stone, which dropped repeatedly,\n\nwear away the stone to do the major quarrying.\n\nThe fine chiseling on these blocks\n\nis being done with copper tools.\n\nThese copper tools would've required a huge workforce\n\njust to keep the copper tools sharp.\n\nSo how do you get a straight vertical side\n\non a piece of stone?\n\nHere, you use gravity\n\nand a tool that engineers still use, a plumb bob,\n\nwhich is a weight on a string.\n\nAnd with a weighted string just hung,\n\nyou just hold it in your hand,\n\nyou know that that string is absolutely vertical.\n\nSo if you're trying to get the side\n\nof a piece of stone vertical,\n\nyou hold a plumb bob next to it,\n\nand you just correct,\n\nyou keep chiseling away at that stone\n\nuntil it is perfectly straight.\n\nSo it would've taken decades\n\nto build the Great Pyramid at Giza.\n\nThe stone was mostly quarried locally.\n\nYou need the stones themselves to be squared,\n\nand you need the ground to be level.\n\nHow do you get the ground level?\n\nYou carve a channel in the ground\n\nand fill it with water,\n\nand the water itself, again, gravity, will level,\n\nand you can mark that water level across your entire site.\n\nSo in the end, it's not impossible technologically\n\nto build pyramids any longer.\n\nIt's a social choice.\n\nWe choose not to build pyramids any longer.\n\nIt's not that we've lost the ability.\n\n@cvanderford asks, Who was the best Pharaoh?\n\nMany people might say that Khufu,\n\nthe builder of the Great Pyramid,\n\nwas the best pharaoh,\n\nbut my personal favorite pharaoh\n\nwould probably be Hatshepsut.\n\nHatshepsut was a woman.\n\nShe reigned as a king, not as a queen.\n\nThat's not so much, we think,\n\nbecause she was trying to pretend that she was a man\n\nas because this was a role usually played by men.\n\nIn her inscriptions, for instance,\n\nshe is still using feminine forms\n\nof the verbs of words to refer to herself.\n\nBut she's shown just like a male pharaoh.\n\n@salma_khan asks,\n\nWatching this show called Ancient Aliens on Netflix.\n\nUm, yeah, so I can't sleep now.\n\nWhy do the pyramids of Egypt match those in Mexico?\n\nThe pyramids in Egypt\n\ndon't actually match the pyramids in Mexico.\n\nThey are different in substantial ways.\n\nThe king is buried in a small chamber\n\nunderneath the pyramid in Egypt.\n\nThe pyramids, as you see them today,\n\nlook like giant staircases.\n\nThey're a little bit rough.\n\nAnd that's not how they would've looked anciently.\n\nSo the final step in making a pyramid\n\nwould have been to clad it in very fine limestone\n\nand then to shave the sides to make it perfectly smooth.\n\nSo this would've been not something\n\nyou could climb anciently.\n\nThe pyramids in Mexico are not tombs at all.\n\nThese are bases for temples,\n\nand the temples are approached by going up the pyramid.\n\nThat said, why do they look similar?\n\nWhy is this basic form of a pyramid\n\nfound in multiple so different places of the ancient world?\n\nAnd there the answer is pretty simple,\n\nand it's that it's not that much\n\nyou can build of that size\n\nwithout modern technology and without steel.\n\nSo to get a really tall structure out of stone,\n\nit needs to be smaller at the top than it is at the bottom.\n\nSo there's not all that many things you can build\n\nthat would get that tall using this technology.\n\nAnd that's really, we think,\n\nwhy we see what looks superficially similar\n\nin such different places in the ancient world.\n\n@_bechiro asks,\n\nWhy did ancient Egypt fall?\n\nSo the fall of ancient Egypt,\n\nfrom a royal perspective,\n\nwhen do there stop being kings of Egypt,\n\nis really when Egypt gets incorporated\n\ninto the Roman Empire\n\nwhen Cleopatra loses the throne.\n\n@lambe_turing asks,\n\nDid you know that Cleopatra,\n\nthe last queen of Egypt, was actually Greek?\n\nYes, I did know that Cleopatra of Egypt was actually Greek.\n\nShe was the descendant of a Greek family\n\nthat had been ruling Egypt for about 300 years\n\nwhen Alexander the Great in 332 BC conquered Egypt.\n\nEgypt then became part of empires\n\nelsewhere in the Mediterranean.\n\nWe don't actually know all that much about Cleopatra.\n\nWe do know that she was bilingual\n\nand spoke both Egyptian and Greek.\n\nCleopatra did hook up with Julius Caesar.\n\nShe also had children with Mark Antony.\n\nShe was definitely playing to keep her kingdom.\n\n@Paul, long string of letters and numbers asks,\n\nEgypt is overrated anyway, in my opinion.\n\nWhat did they invent that was so transformative\n\non the modern world?\n\nWe could talk, for instance,\n\nabout the mobile writing platform of papyrus.\n\nWe write on paper, which is a Chinese invention,\n\nbut that writing should be done by a pen\n\nand that you should be able to send it somewhere easily,\n\nthat is something the Egyptians absolutely pioneered.\n\nAncient Egyptian mud brick architecture was so amazing\n\nthat the ancient Egyptian word for brick\n\nhas actually made it into English.\n\nThat's our word, adobe,\n\ncomes from the ancient Egyptian, ultimately,\n\nacknowledging how excellent their architecture was.\n\n@Andydoodle56 asks,\n\nWill someone ever decipher this ancient language?\n\nImagine the knowledge lost.\n\nIn fact, someone has deciphered\n\nancient Egyptian hieroglyphs,\n\nand scholars can read virtually any inscription\n\nthat we find.\n\nThis is a very typical type of monument,\n\nand what we see here is a dead guy and his wife,\n\nand what they want is to receive offerings\n\nfor the rest of their afterlife.\n\nAnd that's what the inscription tells us.\n\nBut we read this, htp-di-nsw.\n\nAnd n ka n, for the ka of Amenemhat,\n\nthe name of this guy.\n\nSo n ka n Amenemhat, msj n Ip.\n\nFor the ka of Amenemhat, born of Ip,\n\nhis father's name.\n\n@RoxyB1994 asks,\n\nDoes anybody know why the ancient Egyptians\n\nnever painted people front on but only sideways on?\n\nLet's take a look at an illustrated copy\n\nof the Book of the Dead.\n\nSo they chose the most typical,\n\nthe most perfect aspect of every part of the body.\n\nThe person is shown in profile\n\nso that you get the nose in profile,\n\nbut the eye is always shown front on.\n\nShoulders are always shown front on\n\neven though the arms and legs are twisted\n\nin ways that are impossible.\n\nYou can't actually walk like an Egyptian.\n\nIn some ways,\n\nyou can think of ancient Egyptian art like cubism.\n\nIt's showing the same thing from different angles,\n\nfrom different perspectives.\n\nThey wanted a picture of a person\n\nto capture the essence of that person\n\nin a way that was much more eternal.\n\nTheir art deliberately did not look like\n\nanything you could see with your own eyes.\n\nIt's more of a god's-eye view.\n\n@_hajarahsaleesu asks,\n\nWhy do Egyptians mummify their dead?\n\nWhat's the point of preserving the dead?\n\nAnd they did this because they believed\n\nthat in the afterlife people needed their body.\n\nThey continued to eat and to drink,\n\nto speak and breathe,\n\nand even to engage in social relations\n\nwith the people they had known in life.\n\nMost people in ancient Egypt weren't mummified.\n\nIt was an expensive process.\n\nIn fact, it wasn't necessary\n\nin order for bodies to be preserved.\n\nThe Egyptian desert itself\n\ndoes a great job of preserving bodies.\n\nBut for those people who did,\n\nwho could afford mummification,\n\ncloth was really expensive in the ancient world.\n\nThe linen that was used would've included oils and resins,\n\nand we also know that they used forms of salt\n\nthat were naturally occurring in the desert\n\nto dry the body out.\n\nWe know, for instance,\n\nthat they would remove the internal organs.\n\nInternal organs are mushy.\n\nIf you're gonna rot,\n\nit's gonna be because there's so much water\n\nin your internal organs.\n\nSo you take those out and mummify them separately.\n\nIn some periods, they were placed in jars.\n\nOftentimes, the heart is protected\n\nby the placement of an amulet in the form of a heart\n\nthat is placed over that part of the body.\n\nAncient Egyptians didn't care that much about the brain,\n\nand often the brain was, in fact,\n\nremoved from the skull cavity\n\nbefore a mummy was interred.\n\n@missjenny asks,\n\nHow did the ancient Egyptians\n\nget the brain out of the nose during embalming?\n\nSo this big wet thing in your head\n\nthat needs to come out during embalming\n\ncould be extracted through the nose.\n\nAnd we have metal hooks that we think were used\n\nby jamming them up to break the nose bone,\n\nscramble the brain so that it's more or less liquid,\n\nand then with a combination of gravity\n\nand the hook on that metal,\n\nyou pull it out through the nose.\n\nBecause they thought the heart was the seat of intelligence,\n\nnot the brain,\n\nremoving it was a way to ensure\n\nthat the head would be preserved.\n\n@rrofb asks, Did ancient Egypt have cookies?\n\nAncient Egyptians had bread.\n\nThey didn't have sugar,\n\nso their baked goods probably weren't sweet and delicious.\n\nBread was the staple that was even used as wages,\n\nas a kind of money.\n\nSo you would be paid in bread,\n\nand that was probably the majority of most people's diets.\n\nThis is, in fact, a consolidated lump\n\nof the stratographic layers.\n\nThis section represents\n\nprobably between 30 and 50 years of living.\n\nYou can see pot shards here,\n\nbut when we get it under the microscope,\n\nwe can also see things like the remains of the food.\n\nWe have fish bones, we have tiny bits of grain,\n\nbut we do know some about the legumes that they ate,\n\nthings like lentils.\n\nWe have onions and other vegetables that were eaten.\n\nLettuce was considered to be an aphrodisiac\n\nin ancient Egypt.\n\n@shewrotemurder_ asks,\n\nWho the [beep] deciphered hieroglyphics,\n\nand how did they do it?\n\nHieroglyphs were deciphered\n\nby a French scholar named Champollion.\n\nChampollion was one of a group of European scholars\n\nwho was working on a document that had been discovered\n\nwhen Napoleon invaded Egypt in the late 18th century.\n\nThe Rosetta Stone is a trilingual inscription\n\nfrom the Ptolemaic period,\n\nthe late part of Egyptian history.\n\nIt's basically a legal document about taxes and the temple.\n\nThe top part of the inscription is in Egyptian hieroglyphs,\n\nand the middle is in demotic script.\n\nThe bottom one is Greek.\n\nWe've never lost the ability to read Greek.\n\nNow, it took more than 20 years\n\nafter this was discovered\n\nfor the decipherment to be finished.\n\nNow, Champollion was aided by the guess that he had\n\nthat when he saw little circles around a set of hieroglyphs\n\nin the hieroglyphic portion,\n\nthat that probably was a royal name.\n\nAnd the very first thing he could read\n\nwas in fact the name of Cleopatra.\n\nOnce Champollion was able to read the Rosetta Stone,\n\nthis was really cracking the code of hieroglyphs.\n\nAnd this led to the ability\n\nto read increasingly large numbers of inscriptions.\n\n@GeeorgeStyles asks,\n\nHave you ever read the Egyptian Book of the Dead?\n\nIf so, what was interesting about it?\n\nWe have read the Egyptian Book of the Dead.\n\nWe have a piece of one copy here.\n\nThis is just a chunk of it.\n\nThis papyrus is many, many, many meters long.\n\nAnd so the part that we see illustrated here, in fact,\n\nis what we call the weighing of the heart.\n\nThis guy's heart is on a scale,\n\nand the gods are weighing his heart against a feather.\n\nIf his heart is as light as a feather,\n\nthen his heart is pure,\n\nand it will not speak against him,\n\nand that means he can go into the afterlife.\n\nThis very long scroll of the Book of the Dead\n\nwould be rolled up\n\nand tucked between the legs of the dead guy in his tomb.\n\nSo this was something\n\nthat everybody who could afford one wanted a copy of\n\nbecause its spells that allow him\n\nto get into the afterlife and be successful there.\n\nThat is like a cheat sheet\n\nfor getting into the afterlife successfully.\n\n@Justustalking2 asks,\n\nWhat were ancient Egyptian scarabs actually used for?\n\nMost Egyptian scarabs were ring bezels.\n\nSo they were on a piece of metal\n\nthat would've been on a ring,\n\nand they had an inscribed bit on the flat bottom\n\nthat was used as a seal, seals like this.\n\nSo a scarab beetle rolls a ball of dung up over a hill.\n\nThe Egyptians associated that image with the rising sun,\n\nand they gave the scarab credit\n\nfor bringing the sun into being.\n\nSo in having a scarab as your seal,\n\nyou are linking yourself\n\nto the rebirth of the sun every day.\n\n@duckyaisha asks,\n\nWhat's your favorite thing\n\nyou've learned about women in ancient Egypt\n\nfrom your archeological finds?\n\nWomen in ancient Egypt had a status\n\nthat was really rare in the ancient world.\n\nThey could own things, own property.\n\nThey could decide which of their children\n\ninherited their property.\n\nMen got off work\n\nwhen their women in their household had their periods.\n\nSo when women had their period,\n\nthey could expect that their husbands\n\nhad to do the housework for them.\n\n@BlvckJessRabbit asks,\n\nI wonder what the ancient Egyptians view on sex was.\n\nThe ancient Egyptians really liked sex,\n\nand they were not prude about it,\n\nand they weren't shy about it.\n\nThey actually did have a euphemism for it to have sex.\n\nThey would say, to spend a pleasant day.\n\nIt was just totally accepted\n\nthat sex was a normal and enjoyable part of life,\n\nand it wasn't something that was stigmatized\n\nin the same way it has been in many other cultures.\n\nOne way we can really see this,\n\nthe ancient Egyptian language did not have the word virgin.\n\nThere was no idea\n\nthat having sex changed your social position.\n\nIt was just something people then really liked.\n\n@LXYacht asks,\n\nUm, don't Egyptian deities all have animal heads?\n\nNot all ancient Egyptian deities have animal heads,\n\nbut many of them do.\n\nWe have a bunch of gods here.\n\nOn this piece of the Book of the Dead,\n\nwe have the god Horace,\n\nwe can see here with a falcon head.\n\nParticularly associated with kingship\n\nin the scene is Anubis,\n\nand he is shown with the jackal head\n\nthat is typical of gods\n\nwho are associated with cemeteries.\n\nWe think that's in part\n\nbecause cemeteries in the desert\n\nare places where jackals actually would have roamed.\n\n@mozzamarwa asks,\n\nY'all ancient Egypt is [beep] wild to me.\n\nHow did they just discover a new queen\n\nand over 100 new mummies?\n\nFrom aerial photography\n\nto now really high-tech satellites,\n\nwe're able to see from the air\n\nand see patterns of difference on the ground\n\nthat can relate to things that are not visible\n\nwhen you walk on the ground.\n\nWe use X-ray fluorescence,\n\nand we point an XRF X-ray fluorescence gun\n\nat a wall with pigments on it.\n\nWe can get the chemical signature of the pigments.\n\nIf they're using lapis as a pigment,\n\nlapis is the most pure blue pigment that's available.\n\nIt's also really expensive,\n\nand the only ancient source for lapis\n\nis in what's modern Afghanistan.\n\nThat's really far away.\n\nSo questions about the interactions between Egypt\n\nand its broader world\n\nare new kinds of questions that technology opens up for us.\n\nWe will not find another King Tut's tomb probably,\n\nbut we have a ton left to uncover.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nThanks for watching Egyptology Support.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image":

{"title": "Egyptologist Answers Ancient Egypt Questions From Twitter", "text": "Transcript\n\nI'm Professor Laurel Bestock.\n\nLet's answer some questions from the internet.\n\nThis is Egyptology Support.\n\n[light upbeat music]\n\n@FHHuntress asks,\n\nWhen did Ancient Egypt begin exactly according to you?\n\nAncient Egypt's really old.\n\nIf we talk about when the first king of Egypt\n\nactually became king,\n\nwe're talking about 3000 BC.\n\nAnd then we put ourselves on this timeline,\n\nthat would be an even 5,000 years.\n\nSo this then would be when we change from BC to AD,\n\nand we could say,\n\nyou know, Cleopatra's really close to that.\n\nSo the pyramids at Giza are about 2400 BC.\n\nNot only are we closer in time to Cleopatra\n\nthan Cleopatra is to the beginning\n\nof ancient Egyptian Pharaonic history,\n\nthere's even more time\n\nbetween Cleopatra and the pyramids\n\nthan there is between Cleopatra and us.\n\nAncient Egypt was already ancient in ancient Egypt.\n\n@Tsunaze asks, Seriously, how did the Sphinx's nose break?\n\nOur best evidence for how the nose of the Sphinx got broken\n\ncomes from a 15th-century Arabic historian,\n\nand he explains that someone who was angry\n\nactually deliberately shot the nose off the Sphinx\n\nbecause he was upset\n\nthat people were revering this monument from ancient Egypt.\n\nThis person was subsequently lynched by other local people\n\nwho revered the Sphinx.\n\nSo there are also stories\n\nthat Napoleon's army shot the nose off the Sphinx.\n\nWe think that one's probably not right,\n\nin part because we have drawings of the Sphinx\n\nfrom earlier than Napoleon's expedition,\n\nand the nose is already missing.\n\nThe Sphinx depicts the King Khafre.\n\nKhafre, a king of the Fourth Dynasty,\n\nbuilt the second largest pyramid at Giza.\n\n@SilentUschi asks,\n\nSo what did ancient Egyptians talk like?\n\nLike, what did it sound like?\n\nHieroglyphics ain't speech.\n\nWe know a great deal\n\nabout what Egyptian sounded like\n\nin part because the last stage\n\nof the ancient Egyptian language, Coptic,\n\nwas both written in Greek letters\n\nwhich we can still read,\n\nand in fact it's still the liturgical language\n\nof the Coptic Church.\n\nAnd so if you can go watch The Mummy,\n\nyou can hear much of what ancient Egypt sounded like.\n\n[speaking Egyptian]\n\nWe are able to phonetically reconstruct\n\nwhat it sounded like.\n\n[sword unsheathes]\n\nImhotep?\n\nAll mummy movies have somebody named Imhotep.\n\nImhotep was the architect\n\nresponsible for designing the first pyramid built in Egypt.\n\n@wildyouthstyles asks,\n\nWhat are some ancient Egyptian medicine and tools\n\nthey created that are used to this day?\n\nAncient Egyptian medicine was pretty advanced.\n\nWe know, for instance,\n\nthat they performed surgery\n\nto relieve pressure on the brain.\n\nWe have things, for instance,\n\nlike pregnancy tests in ancient Egypt.\n\nA woman who wants to know if she's pregnant\n\nand wants to know what the sex of the baby will be\n\nshould pee on both barley and wheat seeds.\n\nIf she's pregnant, these are gonna sprout,\n\nand which one sprouts first\n\nis gonna tell her whether she's gonna have a girl or a boy.\n\nAnd modern tests on this\n\nhave suggested that in fact the human growth hormone\n\nthat is so increased in pregnant women\n\ndoes have an effect on the germination of grain.\n\n@PPufnstuf asks, Did ancient Egypt have bars and [beep]?\n\nNo, ancient Egypt didn't have bars,\n\nbut the Egyptians were definitely very social,\n\nand alcohol was part of their social lives.\n\nWe know that the Egyptians drank a ton of beer\n\nand quite a bit of wine as well.\n\nThis was mostly done in homes and even in tombs.\n\nThe underground part of the tomb\n\nmight be where your burial chamber is,\n\nbut the above ground part of the tomb is a party palace.\n\nThere's a festival called the Beautiful Feast of the Valley\n\nwhere the whole point was to go get drunk in the tombs\n\nwith your ancestors.\n\nIn order to make beer and wine,\n\nwe have large scale breweries in towns\n\nfrom even before the first king of Egypt\n\nwas present in 3000 BC.\n\n@Princesa_de_NY asks,\n\nWatching this video in class\n\nabout what did ancient Egypt look like,\n\nand I'm pretty sure it's just scene clips\n\nfrom Assassin's Creed: Origins.\n\nSo when we check out the Assassin's Creed: Origins trailer,\n\nthere's a lot in there that's accurate\n\nfrom the landscape itself.\n\nThis sort of green strip around the Nile,\n\nthen cliffs and desert a little bit farther away.\n\nAnd the monuments are very accurately reconstructed.\n\nYou can see the pyramid with a funny-shaped top.\n\nThat's what we call the Bent Pyramid\n\nat a site called Dahshur.\n\nThat pyramid is actually built by the father of Khufu,\n\nthe guy who built the Great Pyramid.\n\nThe reason that is bent is because this is very early\n\nin the history of constructing pyramids.\n\nThey were still figuring out how to build perfect pyramids,\n\nand we think that this one cracked\n\nwhile it was under construction,\n\nand they changed the angle\n\nso that the weight at the top would not be as great.\n\n@rednym asks, How did King Tut manage to be so popular\n\neven though he lived such a short life?\n\nKing Tut is super popular with us\n\nbecause his tomb was found intact.\n\nThe discovery of King Tut's tomb\n\nwas one of the archeological wonders of the world.\n\nIf you go see this stuff in Cairo,\n\nit takes up so many rooms.\n\nYou have chariots,\n\nyou have shrines after shrines after shrines,\n\nnested shrines built around the body of the king\n\nwho's buried not just in one gold coffin\n\nbut in multiple gold coffins.\n\nThe beautiful face mask, also in gold,\n\ninlaid with precious stones that's on top of him.\n\nBut King Tut wasn't that popular in ancient Egypt.\n\nHe lived at a time\n\nthat later Egyptians, in fact, wrote out of history.\n\nSo he was the successor of a king\n\nwho is sometimes referred to as the heretic king Akhenaten,\n\nwho introduced a monotheistic religion in ancient Egypt.\n\nAnd Tutankhamen as one of the kings\n\nwho returned ancient Egypt\n\nto its original polytheistic religion\n\nand opened the temples again.\n\nThe fact that he was short-lived,\n\nnot well-known in later Egypt,\n\nprobably contributed to the fact\n\nthat his tomb was preserved.\n\nNobody thought to look for it.\n\n@KBrownks2 asks,\n\nDid you know that we can't recreate the Egyptian pyramids\n\nwith modern-day technology?\n\nWell guess that means,\n\nmaybe we weren't the most advanced\n\nthe human species has ever been.\n\nWe absolutely have the technology to recreate the pyramids.\n\nThe tools that the Egyptians were using\n\nto create these big stone blocks to make the pyramid\n\nwere of two types.\n\nRough stone balls,\n\na very hard stone, which dropped repeatedly,\n\nwear away the stone to do the major quarrying.\n\nThe fine chiseling on these blocks\n\nis being done with copper tools.\n\nThese copper tools would've required a huge workforce\n\njust to keep the copper tools sharp.\n\nSo how do you get a straight vertical side\n\non a piece of stone?\n\nHere, you use gravity\n\nand a tool that engineers still use, a plumb bob,\n\nwhich is a weight on a string.\n\nAnd with a weighted string just hung,\n\nyou just hold it in your hand,\n\nyou know that that string is absolutely vertical.\n\nSo if you're trying to get the side\n\nof a piece of stone vertical,\n\nyou hold a plumb bob next to it,\n\nand you just correct,\n\nyou keep chiseling away at that stone\n\nuntil it is perfectly straight.\n\nSo it would've taken decades\n\nto build the Great Pyramid at Giza.\n\nThe stone was mostly quarried locally.\n\nYou need the stones themselves to be squared,\n\nand you need the ground to be level.\n\nHow do you get the ground level?\n\nYou carve a channel in the ground\n\nand fill it with water,\n\nand the water itself, again, gravity, will level,\n\nand you can mark that water level across your entire site.\n\nSo in the end, it's not impossible technologically\n\nto build pyramids any longer.\n\nIt's a social choice.\n\nWe choose not to build pyramids any longer.\n\nIt's not that we've lost the ability.\n\n@cvanderford asks, Who was the best Pharaoh?\n\nMany people might say that Khufu,\n\nthe builder of the Great Pyramid,\n\nwas the best pharaoh,\n\nbut my personal favorite pharaoh\n\nwould probably be Hatshepsut.\n\nHatshepsut was a woman.\n\nShe reigned as a king, not as a queen.\n\nThat's not so much, we think,\n\nbecause she was trying to pretend that she was a man\n\nas because this was a role usually played by men.\n\nIn her inscriptions, for instance,\n\nshe is still using feminine forms\n\nof the verbs of words to refer to herself.\n\nBut she's shown just like a male pharaoh.\n\n@salma_khan asks,\n\nWatching this show called Ancient Aliens on Netflix.\n\nUm, yeah, so I can't sleep now.\n\nWhy do the pyramids of Egypt match those in Mexico?\n\nThe pyramids in Egypt\n\ndon't actually match the pyramids in Mexico.\n\nThey are different in substantial ways.\n\nThe king is buried in a small chamber\n\nunderneath the pyramid in Egypt.\n\nThe pyramids, as you see them today,\n\nlook like giant staircases.\n\nThey're a little bit rough.\n\nAnd that's not how they would've looked anciently.\n\nSo the final step in making a pyramid\n\nwould have been to clad it in very fine limestone\n\nand then to shave the sides to make it perfectly smooth.\n\nSo this would've been not something\n\nyou could climb anciently.\n\nThe pyramids in Mexico are not tombs at all.\n\nThese are bases for temples,\n\nand the temples are approached by going up the pyramid.\n\nThat said, why do they look similar?\n\nWhy is this basic form of a pyramid\n\nfound in multiple so different places of the ancient world?\n\nAnd there the answer is pretty simple,\n\nand it's that it's not that much\n\nyou can build of that size\n\nwithout modern technology and without steel.\n\nSo to get a really tall structure out of stone,\n\nit needs to be smaller at the top than it is at the bottom.\n\nSo there's not all that many things you can build\n\nthat would get that tall using this technology.\n\nAnd that's really, we think,\n\nwhy we see what looks superficially similar\n\nin such different places in the ancient world.\n\n@_bechiro asks,\n\nWhy did ancient Egypt fall?\n\nSo the fall of ancient Egypt,\n\nfrom a royal perspective,\n\nwhen do there stop being kings of Egypt,\n\nis really when Egypt gets incorporated\n\ninto the Roman Empire\n\nwhen Cleopatra loses the throne.\n\n@lambe_turing asks,\n\nDid you know that Cleopatra,\n\nthe last queen of Egypt, was actually Greek?\n\nYes, I did know that Cleopatra of Egypt was actually Greek.\n\nShe was the descendant of a Greek family\n\nthat had been ruling Egypt for about 300 years\n\nwhen Alexander the Great in 332 BC conquered Egypt.\n\nEgypt then became part of empires\n\nelsewhere in the Mediterranean.\n\nWe don't actually know all that much about Cleopatra.\n\nWe do know that she was bilingual\n\nand spoke both Egyptian and Greek.\n\nCleopatra did hook up with Julius Caesar.\n\nShe also had children with Mark Antony.\n\nShe was definitely playing to keep her kingdom.\n\n@Paul, long string of letters and numbers asks,\n\nEgypt is overrated anyway, in my opinion.\n\nWhat did they invent that was so transformative\n\non the modern world?\n\nWe could talk, for instance,\n\nabout the mobile writing platform of papyrus.\n\nWe write on paper, which is a Chinese invention,\n\nbut that writing should be done by a pen\n\nand that you should be able to send it somewhere easily,\n\nthat is something the Egyptians absolutely pioneered.\n\nAncient Egyptian mud brick architecture was so amazing\n\nthat the ancient Egyptian word for brick\n\nhas actually made it into English.\n\nThat's our word, adobe,\n\ncomes from the ancient Egyptian, ultimately,\n\nacknowledging how excellent their architecture was.\n\n@Andydoodle56 asks,\n\nWill someone ever decipher this ancient language?\n\nImagine the knowledge lost.\n\nIn fact, someone has deciphered\n\nancient Egyptian hieroglyphs,\n\nand scholars can read virtually any inscription\n\nthat we find.\n\nThis is a very typical type of monument,\n\nand what we see here is a dead guy and his wife,\n\nand what they want is to receive offerings\n\nfor the rest of their afterlife.\n\nAnd that's what the inscription tells us.\n\nBut we read this, htp-di-nsw.\n\nAnd n ka n, for the ka of Amenemhat,\n\nthe name of this guy.\n\nSo n ka n Amenemhat, msj n Ip.\n\nFor the ka of Amenemhat, born of Ip,\n\nhis father's name.\n\n@RoxyB1994 asks,\n\nDoes anybody know why the ancient Egyptians\n\nnever painted people front on but only sideways on?\n\nLet's take a look at an illustrated copy\n\nof the Book of the Dead.\n\nSo they chose the most typical,\n\nthe most perfect aspect of every part of the body.\n\nThe person is shown in profile\n\nso that you get the nose in profile,\n\nbut the eye is always shown front on.\n\nShoulders are always shown front on\n\neven though the arms and legs are twisted\n\nin ways that are impossible.\n\nYou can't actually walk like an Egyptian.\n\nIn some ways,\n\nyou can think of ancient Egyptian art like cubism.\n\nIt's showing the same thing from different angles,\n\nfrom different perspectives.\n\nThey wanted a picture of a person\n\nto capture the essence of that person\n\nin a way that was much more eternal.\n\nTheir art deliberately did not look like\n\nanything you could see with your own eyes.\n\nIt's more of a god's-eye view.\n\n@_hajarahsaleesu asks,\n\nWhy do Egyptians mummify their dead?\n\nWhat's the point of preserving the dead?\n\nAnd they did this because they believed\n\nthat in the afterlife people needed their body.\n\nThey continued to eat and to drink,\n\nto speak and breathe,\n\nand even to engage in social relations\n\nwith the people they had known in life.\n\nMost people in ancient Egypt weren't mummified.\n\nIt was an expensive process.\n\nIn fact, it wasn't necessary\n\nin order for bodies to be preserved.\n\nThe Egyptian desert itself\n\ndoes a great job of preserving bodies.\n\nBut for those people who did,\n\nwho could afford mummification,\n\ncloth was really expensive in the ancient world.\n\nThe linen that was used would've included oils and resins,\n\nand we also know that they used forms of salt\n\nthat were naturally occurring in the desert\n\nto dry the body out.\n\nWe know, for instance,\n\nthat they would remove the internal organs.\n\nInternal organs are mushy.\n\nIf you're gonna rot,\n\nit's gonna be because there's so much water\n\nin your internal organs.\n\nSo you take those out and mummify them separately.\n\nIn some periods, they were placed in jars.\n\nOftentimes, the heart is protected\n\nby the placement of an amulet in the form of a heart\n\nthat is placed over that part of the body.\n\nAncient Egyptians didn't care that much about the brain,\n\nand often the brain was, in fact,\n\nremoved from the skull cavity\n\nbefore a mummy was interred.\n\n@missjenny asks,\n\nHow did the ancient Egyptians\n\nget the brain out of the nose during embalming?\n\nSo this big wet thing in your head\n\nthat needs to come out during embalming\n\ncould be extracted through the nose.\n\nAnd we have metal hooks that we think were used\n\nby jamming them up to break the nose bone,\n\nscramble the brain so that it's more or less liquid,\n\nand then with a combination of gravity\n\nand the hook on that metal,\n\nyou pull it out through the nose.\n\nBecause they thought the heart was the seat of intelligence,\n\nnot the brain,\n\nremoving it was a way to ensure\n\nthat the head would be preserved.\n\n@rrofb asks, Did ancient Egypt have cookies?\n\nAncient Egyptians had bread.\n\nThey didn't have sugar,\n\nso their baked goods probably weren't sweet and delicious.\n\nBread was the staple that was even used as wages,\n\nas a kind of money.\n\nSo you would be paid in bread,\n\nand that was probably the majority of most people's diets.\n\nThis is, in fact, a consolidated lump\n\nof the stratographic layers.\n\nThis section represents\n\nprobably between 30 and 50 years of living.\n\nYou can see pot shards here,\n\nbut when we get it under the microscope,\n\nwe can also see things like the remains of the food.\n\nWe have fish bones, we have tiny bits of grain,\n\nbut we do know some about the legumes that they ate,\n\nthings like lentils.\n\nWe have onions and other vegetables that were eaten.\n\nLettuce was considered to be an aphrodisiac\n\nin ancient Egypt.\n\n@shewrotemurder_ asks,\n\nWho the [beep] deciphered hieroglyphics,\n\nand how did they do it?\n\nHieroglyphs were deciphered\n\nby a French scholar named Champollion.\n\nChampollion was one of a group of European scholars\n\nwho was working on a document that had been discovered\n\nwhen Napoleon invaded Egypt in the late 18th century.\n\nThe Rosetta Stone is a trilingual inscription\n\nfrom the Ptolemaic period,\n\nthe late part of Egyptian history.\n\nIt's basically a legal document about taxes and the temple.\n\nThe top part of the inscription is in Egyptian hieroglyphs,\n\nand the middle is in demotic script.\n\nThe bottom one is Greek.\n\nWe've never lost the ability to read Greek.\n\nNow, it took more than 20 years\n\nafter this was discovered\n\nfor the decipherment to be finished.\n\nNow, Champollion was aided by the guess that he had\n\nthat when he saw little circles around a set of hieroglyphs\n\nin the hieroglyphic portion,\n\nthat that probably was a royal name.\n\nAnd the very first thing he could read\n\nwas in fact the name of Cleopatra.\n\nOnce Champollion was able to read the Rosetta Stone,\n\nthis was really cracking the code of hieroglyphs.\n\nAnd this led to the ability\n\nto read increasingly large numbers of inscriptions.\n\n@GeeorgeStyles asks,\n\nHave you ever read the Egyptian Book of the Dead?\n\nIf so, what was interesting about it?\n\nWe have read the Egyptian Book of the Dead.\n\nWe have a piece of one copy here.\n\nThis is just a chunk of it.\n\nThis papyrus is many, many, many meters long.\n\nAnd so the part that we see illustrated here, in fact,\n\nis what we call the weighing of the heart.\n\nThis guy's heart is on a scale,\n\nand the gods are weighing his heart against a feather.\n\nIf his heart is as light as a feather,\n\nthen his heart is pure,\n\nand it will not speak against him,\n\nand that means he can go into the afterlife.\n\nThis very long scroll of the Book of the Dead\n\nwould be rolled up\n\nand tucked between the legs of the dead guy in his tomb.\n\nSo this was something\n\nthat everybody who could afford one wanted a copy of\n\nbecause its spells that allow him\n\nto get into the afterlife and be successful there.\n\nThat is like a cheat sheet\n\nfor getting into the afterlife successfully.\n\n@Justustalking2 asks,\n\nWhat were ancient Egyptian scarabs actually used for?\n\nMost Egyptian scarabs were ring bezels.\n\nSo they were on a piece of metal\n\nthat would've been on a ring,\n\nand they had an inscribed bit on the flat bottom\n\nthat was used as a seal, seals like this.\n\nSo a scarab beetle rolls a ball of dung up over a hill.\n\nThe Egyptians associated that image with the rising sun,\n\nand they gave the scarab credit\n\nfor bringing the sun into being.\n\nSo in having a scarab as your seal,\n\nyou are linking yourself\n\nto the rebirth of the sun every day.\n\n@duckyaisha asks,\n\nWhat's your favorite thing\n\nyou've learned about women in ancient Egypt\n\nfrom your archeological finds?\n\nWomen in ancient Egypt had a status\n\nthat was really rare in the ancient world.\n\nThey could own things, own property.\n\nThey could decide which of their children\n\ninherited their property.\n\nMen got off work\n\nwhen their women in their household had their periods.\n\nSo when women had their period,\n\nthey could expect that their husbands\n\nhad to do the housework for them.\n\n@BlvckJessRabbit asks,\n\nI wonder what the ancient Egyptians view on sex was.\n\nThe ancient Egyptians really liked sex,\n\nand they were not prude about it,\n\nand they weren't shy about it.\n\nThey actually did have a euphemism for it to have sex.\n\nThey would say, to spend a pleasant day.\n\nIt was just totally accepted\n\nthat sex was a normal and enjoyable part of life,\n\nand it wasn't something that was stigmatized\n\nin the same way it has been in many other cultures.\n\nOne way we can really see this,\n\nthe ancient Egyptian language did not have the word virgin.\n\nThere was no idea\n\nthat having sex changed your social position.\n\nIt was just something people then really liked.\n\n@LXYacht asks,\n\nUm, don't Egyptian deities all have animal heads?\n\nNot all ancient Egyptian deities have animal heads,\n\nbut many of them do.\n\nWe have a bunch of gods here.\n\nOn this piece of the Book of the Dead,\n\nwe have the god Horace,\n\nwe can see here with a falcon head.\n\nParticularly associated with kingship\n\nin the scene is Anubis,\n\nand he is shown with the jackal head\n\nthat is typical of gods\n\nwho are associated with cemeteries.\n\nWe think that's in part\n\nbecause cemeteries in the desert\n\nare places where jackals actually would have roamed.\n\n@mozzamarwa asks,\n\nY'all ancient Egypt is [beep] wild to me.\n\nHow did they just discover a new queen\n\nand over 100 new mummies?\n\nFrom aerial photography\n\nto now really high-tech satellites,\n\nwe're able to see from the air\n\nand see patterns of difference on the ground\n\nthat can relate to things that are not visible\n\nwhen you walk on the ground.\n\nWe use X-ray fluorescence,\n\nand we point an XRF X-ray fluorescence gun\n\nat a wall with pigments on it.\n\nWe can get the chemical signature of the pigments.\n\nIf they're using lapis as a pigment,\n\nlapis is the most pure blue pigment that's available.\n\nIt's also really expensive,\n\nand the only ancient source for lapis\n\nis in what's modern Afghanistan.\n\nThat's really far away.\n\nSo questions about the interactions between Egypt\n\nand its broader world\n\nare new kinds of questions that technology opens up for us.\n\nWe will not find another King Tut's tomb probably,\n\nbut we have a ton left to uncover.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nThanks for watching Egyptology Support.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image":

Digital-only subscriptions are non-refundable, and any notice of cancellation that you provide will only take effect at the end of your subscription period.

{"title": "WIRED\u2019s \u2018On Background\u2019 Policy", "text": "Many powerful companies make a practice of obfuscating or dodging accountability when speaking to media outlets by providing information while insisting it not be attributed to anyone in particular, and sometimes not even to the company itself. For that reason, WIRED is joining the Verge, Quartz, and others in making its editorial standards clearer.\n\nAnyone talking to WIRED reporters in any official capacity does so on the record by default. This means that what you say or write can be quoted and attributed to you by name, not just as \u201ca company spokesperson.\u201d We typically allow anonymity only to sources who could face retaliation or be endangered by the information they provide, and when we do so we explain our reasons to readers. As Julia Angwin, editor in chief of the Markup, has noted, \u201cCorporate spokespeople who are paid to provide information simply don\u2019t meet the criteria for being granted anonymity.\u201d\n\nSometimes we may agree to have a conversation on background, meaning we can use the information you provide, but will not identify you by name. Conversations are on background only when we agree to it. If you send us a statement \u201con background\u201d without prior agreement, we may still treat it as on the record.\n\nYou must also get our agreement for each proposed condition of the conversation, such as requests to not quote a particular statement directly or to identify a source in a certain way. Please be clear about your exact requests every time you speak with WIRED. At our discretion we may also tell our readers why we\u2019re providing the information in this way.\n\nOff-the-record conversations cannot be used for publication, and they also must be agreed to (which we rarely do for corporate spokespeople).\n\nThe companies you speak for play significant roles in shaping the future; we have a responsibility to tell our readers how we got the information about your plans to shape it.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast', 'Andy Greenberg', 'Matt Burgess', 'Caroline Haskins', 'Jessica Rawnsley']", "top_image": "https://www.wired.com/verso/static/wired/assets/favicon.ico", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "15 Best Mattresses You Can Buy Online (2024)", "text": "You'll spend a third of your life on a mattress, which means picking the right one is important. Start with your preferred sleeping position and how much support you need. Here are a few tips.\n\nShould you buy a firm or soft mattress? Generally, heavier people and back or stomach sleepers will do better with firmer mattresses, while lighter people and side sleepers enjoy softer mattresses. Temperature is also an issue: Softer mattresses sleep warmer since your body is sinking into a layer of fabric and foam. Keep in mind that all mattresses have a break-in period, and the way the mattress feels on your first night won't be how it feels after a week or two.\n\nDo you want a hybrid or foam mattress? The next big question is whether you want a foam mattress or a hybrid model that layers foam with built-in springs. We tend to recommend hybrids because they are more stable and supportive, and they usually stay cooler. Hybrids are often slightly pricier. Foam mattresses tend to be softer, lighter, and cheaper.\n\nWhat size mattress do you need? The prices below are based on the queen size, but almost all mattresses come in the standard sizes of Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, and California King. You'll want to buy a mattress based on the size of your bed frame.\n\nHow easy is it to set up a bed-in-a-box? Most of these mattresses are delivered in a box, vacuum-sealed, and rolled up. Some are pretty heavy\u2014up to 150 pounds\u2014so be sure you have someone to help you. After you unroll your bed-in-a-box mattress and cut the vacuum bag open, it'll immediately begin to inflate, so unbox it on your bed frame or near it. We have a helpful guide on how to set up the mattress you bought online with more tips. The mattresses are usually ready to go in a few hours, but most manufacturers recommend giving them two days to reach their normal state.\n\nShould you wait for a sale to buy a mattress? Mattresses go on sale often. If you see one at full price, there's a strong chance you can save hundreds of dollars by waiting for the next big sale event (every few months).\n\nWhat if you don't like the mattress you bought online? Most of the mattresses we have tested and recommend have at least a 100-night testing period and a 10-year warranty. You may want to look at the company's policy as you may be on the hook for a nominal return fee.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast', 'Martin Cizmar', 'Parker Hall', 'Carlton Reid', 'Ryan Waniata', 'Simon Hill', 'Matt Jancer', 'Adrienne So', 'Julian Chokkattu', 'Medea Giordano']", "top_image": "https://media.wired.com/photos/65416b9fbb61c8e31def6e2c/191:100/w_2580,c_limit/Helix%20Midnight%20Luxe%20-%20Angle%20-%20Wired.jpg", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "The 15 Best Electric Bikes for Every Kind of Ride", "text": "You've seen the bikes around your neighborhood. They look like so much fun! You want one! But ebikes have so many different specs and price points. Here's what I would consider, in your position.\n\nCan I build my own bike?\n\nMany affordable bikes now come direct-to-consumer\u2014meaning that they are pre-tuned or partially assembled in a box. As Peter Flax recently noted in Bicycling magazine, these bikes do not get nearly the testing or vetting that bikes from a bigger manufacturer get. Unless you're not riding much or for many miles, or are experienced with modifying your own bike, I recommend working with an established manufacturer that has a dealer network. I also do not recommend a smart ebike. As we can see with VanMoof's recent implosion, you may have difficulty getting your smart ebike repaired if the company folds.\n\nWhy do some bikes cost more?\n\nThey have higher-end components. Batteries and motors from high-end brands like Bosch and Shimano often are more powerful and cover more distance, with a 90- or 120-mile range, as compared to the 15-20 mile ranges you'll see on more affordable bikes. However, this may not matter if you have a short commute.\n\nWhat terrain do you live on?\n\nIf you live in a flat area, you're probably fine with a 250-watt motor, which is the European speed standard. However, if you live near hills or haul a lot of stuff, you might want to consider a 500-watt or 750-watt motor and a few extras, like hydraulic disc brakes, which will help prevent you from skidding into traffic.\n\nI would also look for a mid-drive motor instead of a hub-drive motor. Mid-drive motors are located in the center of your bike and feel more natural. A hub drive is on your rear axle and shifts your center of gravity backward, which takes some getting used to. It can throw you off balance when you're going up steep hills.\n\nFollow some basic safety tips.\n\nNot sure where to start? The biking advocacy group PeopleForBikes recently released their safety education program, E-Bike Smart, which they created in collaboration with the League of American Bicyclists and Bicycle Colorado.

{"title": "Internet users are getting younger; now the UK is weighing up if AI can help protect them", "text": "Internet users are getting younger; now the UK is weighing up if AI can help protect them\n\nArtificial intelligence has been in the crosshairs of governments over how it might be misused for fraud, disinformation and other malicious online activity; now a U.K. regulator wants to explore how AI is used on the other side: in the fight against malicious content when it involves children.\n\nOfcom, the regulator charged with enforcing the U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act, it plans to launch a consultation on how AI and other automated tools are used today, and can be used in the future, to proactively detect and remove illegal content online, specifically to protect children from harmful content and to identify child sex abuse material previously hard to detect.\n\nThe move coincides with Ofcom publishing research showing that younger users are more connected than ever before: among children as young as 3 or 4 years old, some 84% are already going online; and nearly one-quarter of 5-7 year-olds surveyed already own their own smartphones.\n\nThe tools that Ofcom is introducing would be part of a wider set of proposals the regulator is putting together focused on online child safety measures. Consultations for the comprehensive proposals will start in the coming weeks with the AI consultation coming later this year, Ofcom said.\n\nMark Bunting, a director in Ofcom\u2019s Online Safety Group, says that its interest in AI will start with a look at how well it\u2019s used as a screening tool today.\n\n\u201cSome services do already use those tools to identify and shield children from this content,\u201d he said in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cBut there isn\u2019t much information about how accurate and effective those tools are. We want to look at ways in which we can ensure that industry is assessing [that] when they\u2019re using them, making sure that risks to free expression and privacy are being managed.\u201d\n\nOne likely result will be Ofcom recommending how and what platforms should assess, which could potentially lead not only to the platforms adopting more sophisticated tooling, but potentially fines if they fail to deliver improvements either in blocking content, or creating better ways to keep younger users from seeing it.\n\n\u201cAs with a lot of online safety regulation, the responsibility sits with the firms to make sure that they\u2019re taking appropriate steps and using appropriate tools to protect users,\u201d he said.\n\nThere will be both critics and supporters of the moves. AI researchers are finding ever-more sophisticated ways of using AI to detect, for example, deepfakes, as well as to verify users online. Yet there are just as many skeptics who note that AI detection is far from foolproof.\n\nOfcom announced the consultation on AI tools at the same time it published its latest research into how children are engaging online in the U.K., which found that overall, there are more younger children connected up than ever before, so much so that Ofcom is now breaking out activity among ever-younger age brackets.\n\nMobile tech is particularly sticky and increasing with children these days. In surveys of parents and students ranging between 2,000 and 3,400 respondents (depending on the questions being asked), nearly one-quarter, 24%, of all 5- to 7-year-olds now own their own smartphones, and when you include tablets, the numbers go up to 76%.\n\nThat same age bracket is also using media a lot more on those devices: 65% have made voice and video calls (versus 59% just a year ago), and half of the kids (versus 39% a year ago) are watching streamed media.\n\nAge restrictions around some mainstream social media apps are getting lower, yet whatever the limits, in the U.K. they do not appear to be heeded anyway. Some 38% of 5- to 7-year-olds are using social media, Ofcom found. Meta\u2019s WhatsApp, at 37%, is the most popular app among them.\n\nAnd in possibly the first instance of Meta\u2019s flagship image app being relieved to be less popular than ByteDance\u2019s viral sensation, TikTok was found to be used by 30% of 5- to 7-year-olds, with Instagram at \u201cjust\u201d 22%. Discord rounded out the list but is significantly less popular at only 4%.\n\nAround one-third, 32%, of kids of this age are going online on their own, and 30% of parents said that they were fine with their underaged children having social media profiles. YouTube Kids remains the most popular network for younger users, at 48%.\n\nGaming, a perennial favorite with children, has grown to be used by 41% of 5- to 7-year-olds, with 15% of kids of this age bracket playing shooter games.\n\nWhile 76% of parents surveyed said that they talked to their young children about staying safe online, there are question marks, Ofcom points out, between what a child sees and what that child might report. In researching older children aged 8-17, Ofcom interviewed them directly. It found that 32% of the kids reported that they\u2019d seen worrying content online, but only 20% of their parents said they reported anything.\n\nEven accounting for some reporting inconsistencies, \u201cThe research suggests a disconnect between older children\u2019s exposure to potentially harmful content online, and what they share with their parents about their online experiences,\u201d Ofcom writes. And worrying content is just one challenge: deepfakes are also an issue. Among children aged 16-17, Ofcom said, 25% said they were not confident about distinguishing fake from real online.", "authors": "['Ingrid Lunden']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-499479381.jpg?resize=1200,800", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "Internet users are getting younger; now the UK is weighing up if AI can help protect them", "text": "Internet users are getting younger; now the UK is weighing up if AI can help protect them\n\nArtificial intelligence has been in the crosshairs of governments over how it might be misused for fraud, disinformation and other malicious online activity; now a U.K. regulator wants to explore how AI is used on the other side: in the fight against malicious content when it involves children.\n\nOfcom, the regulator charged with enforcing the U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act, it plans to launch a consultation on how AI and other automated tools are used today, and can be used in the future, to proactively detect and remove illegal content online, specifically to protect children from harmful content and to identify child sex abuse material previously hard to detect.\n\nThe move coincides with Ofcom publishing research showing that younger users are more connected than ever before: among children as young as 3 or 4 years old, some 84% are already going online; and nearly one-quarter of 5-7 year-olds surveyed already own their own smartphones.\n\nThe tools that Ofcom is introducing would be part of a wider set of proposals the regulator is putting together focused on online child safety measures. Consultations for the comprehensive proposals will start in the coming weeks with the AI consultation coming later this year, Ofcom said.\n\nMark Bunting, a director in Ofcom\u2019s Online Safety Group, says that its interest in AI will start with a look at how well it\u2019s used as a screening tool today.\n\n\u201cSome services do already use those tools to identify and shield children from this content,\u201d he said in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cBut there isn\u2019t much information about how accurate and effective those tools are. We want to look at ways in which we can ensure that industry is assessing [that] when they\u2019re using them, making sure that risks to free expression and privacy are being managed.\u201d\n\nOne likely result will be Ofcom recommending how and what platforms should assess, which could potentially lead not only to the platforms adopting more sophisticated tooling, but potentially fines if they fail to deliver improvements either in blocking content, or creating better ways to keep younger users from seeing it.\n\n\u201cAs with a lot of online safety regulation, the responsibility sits with the firms to make sure that they\u2019re taking appropriate steps and using appropriate tools to protect users,\u201d he said.\n\nThere will be both critics and supporters of the moves. AI researchers are finding ever-more sophisticated ways of using AI to detect, for example, deepfakes, as well as to verify users online. Yet there are just as many skeptics who note that AI detection is far from foolproof.\n\nOfcom announced the consultation on AI tools at the same time it published its latest research into how children are engaging online in the U.K., which found that overall, there are more younger children connected up than ever before, so much so that Ofcom is now breaking out activity among ever-younger age brackets.\n\nMobile tech is particularly sticky and increasing with children these days. In surveys of parents and students ranging between 2,000 and 3,400 respondents (depending on the questions being asked), nearly one-quarter, 24%, of all 5- to 7-year-olds now own their own smartphones, and when you include tablets, the numbers go up to 76%.\n\nThat same age bracket is also using media a lot more on those devices: 65% have made voice and video calls (versus 59% just a year ago), and half of the kids (versus 39% a year ago) are watching streamed media.\n\nAge restrictions around some mainstream social media apps are getting lower, yet whatever the limits, in the U.K. they do not appear to be heeded anyway. Some 38% of 5- to 7-year-olds are using social media, Ofcom found. Meta\u2019s WhatsApp, at 37%, is the most popular app among them.\n\nAnd in possibly the first instance of Meta\u2019s flagship image app being relieved to be less popular than ByteDance\u2019s viral sensation, TikTok was found to be used by 30% of 5- to 7-year-olds, with Instagram at \u201cjust\u201d 22%. Discord rounded out the list but is significantly less popular at only 4%.\n\nAround one-third, 32%, of kids of this age are going online on their own, and 30% of parents said that they were fine with their underaged children having social media profiles. YouTube Kids remains the most popular network for younger users, at 48%.\n\nGaming, a perennial favorite with children, has grown to be used by 41% of 5- to 7-year-olds, with 15% of kids of this age bracket playing shooter games.\n\nWhile 76% of parents surveyed said that they talked to their young children about staying safe online, there are question marks, Ofcom points out, between what a child sees and what that child might report. In researching older children aged 8-17, Ofcom interviewed them directly. It found that 32% of the kids reported that they\u2019d seen worrying content online, but only 20% of their parents said they reported anything.\n\nEven accounting for some reporting inconsistencies, \u201cThe research suggests a disconnect between older children\u2019s exposure to potentially harmful content online, and what they share with their parents about their online experiences,\u201d Ofcom writes. And worrying content is just one challenge: deepfakes are also an issue. Among children aged 16-17, Ofcom said, 25% said they were not confident about distinguishing fake from real online.", "authors": "['Ingrid Lunden']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-499479381.jpg?resize=1200,800", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/18/meta-releases-llama-3-claims-its-among-the-best-open-models-available/
{"title": "Meta releases Llama 3, claims it\u2019s among the best open models available", "text": "Meta has released the latest entry in its Llama series of open generative AI models: Llama 3. Or, more accurately, the company has debuted two models in its new Llama 3 family, with the rest to come at an unspecified future date.\n\nMeta describes the new models \u2014 Llama 3 8B, which contains 8 billion parameters, and Llama 3 70B, which contains 70 billion parameters \u2014 as a \u201cmajor leap\u201d compared to the previous-gen Llama models, Llama 2 8B and Llama 2 70B, performance-wise. (Parameters essentially define the skill of an AI model on a problem, like analyzing and generating text; higher-parameter-count models are, generally speaking, more capable than lower-parameter-count models.) In fact, Meta says that, for their respective parameter counts, Llama 3 8B and Llama 3 70B \u2014 trained on two custom-built 24,000 GPU clusters \u2014 are are among the best-performing generative AI models available today.\n\nThat\u2019s quite a claim to make. So how is Meta supporting it? Well, the company points to the Llama 3 models\u2019 scores on popular AI benchmarks like MMLU (which attempts to measure knowledge), ARC (which attempts to measure skill acquisition) and DROP (which tests a model\u2019s reasoning over chunks of text). As we\u2019ve written about before, the usefulness \u2014 and validity \u2014 of these benchmarks is up for debate. But for better or worse, they remain one of the few standardized ways by which AI players like Meta evaluate their models.\n\nLlama 3 8B bests other open models such as Mistral\u2019s Mistral 7B and Google\u2019s Gemma 7B, both of which contain 7 billion parameters, on at least nine benchmarks: MMLU, ARC, DROP, GPQA (a set of biology-, physics- and chemistry-related questions), HumanEval (a code generation test), GSM-8K (math word problems), MATH (another mathematics benchmark), AGIEval (a problem-solving test set) and BIG-Bench Hard (a commonsense reasoning evaluation).\n\nNow, Mistral 7B and Gemma 7B aren\u2019t exactly on the bleeding edge (Mistral 7B was released last September), and in a few of the benchmarks Meta cites, Llama 3 8B scores only a few percentage points higher than either. But Meta also makes the claim that the larger-parameter-count Llama 3 model, Llama 3 70B, is competitive with flagship generative AI models, including Gemini 1.5 Pro, the latest in Google\u2019s Gemini series.\n\nLlama 3 70B beats Gemini 1.5 Pro on MMLU, HumanEval and GSM-8K, and \u2014 while it doesn\u2019t rival Anthropic\u2019s most performant model, Claude 3 Opus \u2014 Llama 3 70B scores better than the second-weakest model in the Claude 3 series, Claude 3 Sonnet, on five benchmarks (MMLU, GPQA, HumanEval, GSM-8K and MATH).\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Meta also developed its own test set covering use cases ranging from coding and creative writing to reasoning to summarization, and \u2014 surprise! \u2014 Llama 3 70B came out on top against Mistral\u2019s Mistral Medium model, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3.5 and Claude Sonnet. Meta says that it gated its modeling teams from accessing the set to maintain objectivity, but obviously \u2014 given that Meta itself devised the test \u2014 the results have to be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nMore qualitatively, Meta says that users of the new Llama models should expect more \u201csteerability,\u201d a lower likelihood to refuse to answer questions, and higher accuracy on trivia questions, questions pertaining to history and STEM fields such as engineering and science and general coding recommendations. That\u2019s in part thanks to a much larger dataset: a collection of 15 trillion tokens, or a mind-boggling ~750,000,000,000 words \u2014 seven times the size of the Llama 2 training set. (In the AI field, \u201ctokens\u201d refers to subdivided bits of raw data, like the syllables \u201cfan,\u201d \u201ctas\u201d and \u201ctic\u201d in the word \u201cfantastic.\u201d)\n\nWhere did this data come from? Good question. Meta wouldn\u2019t say, revealing only that it drew from \u201cpublicly available sources,\u201d included four times more code than in the Llama 2 training dataset and that 5% of that set has non-English data (in ~30 languages) to improve performance on languages other than English. Meta also said it used synthetic data \u2014 i.e. AI-generated data \u2014 to create longer documents for the Llama 3 models to train on, a somewhat controversial approach due to the potential performance drawbacks.\n\n\u201cWhile the models we\u2019re releasing today are only fine tuned for English outputs, the increased data diversity helps the models better recognize nuances and patterns, and perform strongly across a variety of tasks,\u201d Meta writes in a blog post shared with TechCrunch.\n\nMany generative AI vendors see training data as a competitive advantage and thus keep it and info pertaining to it close to the chest. But training data details are also a potential source of IP-related lawsuits, another disincentive to reveal much. Recent reporting revealed that Meta, in its quest to maintain pace with AI rivals, at one point used copyrighted e-books for AI training despite the company\u2019s own lawyers\u2019 warnings; Meta and OpenAI are the subject of an ongoing lawsuit brought by authors including comedian Sarah Silverman over the vendors\u2019 alleged unauthorized use of copyrighted data for training.\n\nSo what about toxicity and bias, two other common problems with generative AI models (including Llama 2)? Does Llama 3 improve in those areas? Yes, claims Meta.\n\nMeta says that it developed new data-filtering pipelines to boost the quality of its model training data, and that it has updated its pair of generative AI safety suites, Llama Guard and CybersecEval, to attempt to prevent the misuse of and unwanted text generations from Llama 3 models and others. The company\u2019s also releasing a new tool, Code Shield, designed to detect code from generative AI models that might introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\nFiltering isn\u2019t foolproof, though \u2014 and tools like Llama Guard, CyberSecEval and Code Shield only go so far. (See: Llama 2\u2019s tendency to make up answers to questions and leak private health and financial information.) We\u2019ll have to wait and see how the Llama 3 models perform in the wild, inclusive of testing from academics on alternative benchmarks.\n\nMeta says that the Llama 3 models \u2014 which are available for download now, and powering Meta\u2019s Meta AI assistant on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and the web \u2014 will soon be hosted in managed form across a wide range of cloud platforms including AWS, Databricks, Google Cloud, Hugging Face, Kaggle, IBM\u2019s WatsonX, Microsoft Azure, Nvidia\u2019s NIM and Snowflake. In the future, versions of the models optimized for hardware from AMD, AWS, Dell, Intel, Nvidia and Qualcomm will also be made available.\n\nThe Llama 3 models might be widely available.

{"title": "Meta releases Llama 3, claims it\u2019s among the best open models available", "text": "Meta has released the latest entry in its Llama series of open generative AI models: Llama 3. Or, more accurately, the company has debuted two models in its new Llama 3 family, with the rest to come at an unspecified future date.\n\nMeta describes the new models \u2014 Llama 3 8B, which contains 8 billion parameters, and Llama 3 70B, which contains 70 billion parameters \u2014 as a \u201cmajor leap\u201d compared to the previous-gen Llama models, Llama 2 8B and Llama 2 70B, performance-wise. (Parameters essentially define the skill of an AI model on a problem, like analyzing and generating text; higher-parameter-count models are, generally speaking, more capable than lower-parameter-count models.) In fact, Meta says that, for their respective parameter counts, Llama 3 8B and Llama 3 70B \u2014 trained on two custom-built 24,000 GPU clusters \u2014 are are among the best-performing generative AI models available today.\n\nThat\u2019s quite a claim to make. So how is Meta supporting it? Well, the company points to the Llama 3 models\u2019 scores on popular AI benchmarks like MMLU (which attempts to measure knowledge), ARC (which attempts to measure skill acquisition) and DROP (which tests a model\u2019s reasoning over chunks of text). As we\u2019ve written about before, the usefulness \u2014 and validity \u2014 of these benchmarks is up for debate. But for better or worse, they remain one of the few standardized ways by which AI players like Meta evaluate their models.\n\nLlama 3 8B bests other open models such as Mistral\u2019s Mistral 7B and Google\u2019s Gemma 7B, both of which contain 7 billion parameters, on at least nine benchmarks: MMLU, ARC, DROP, GPQA (a set of biology-, physics- and chemistry-related questions), HumanEval (a code generation test), GSM-8K (math word problems), MATH (another mathematics benchmark), AGIEval (a problem-solving test set) and BIG-Bench Hard (a commonsense reasoning evaluation).\n\nNow, Mistral 7B and Gemma 7B aren\u2019t exactly on the bleeding edge (Mistral 7B was released last September), and in a few of the benchmarks Meta cites, Llama 3 8B scores only a few percentage points higher than either. But Meta also makes the claim that the larger-parameter-count Llama 3 model, Llama 3 70B, is competitive with flagship generative AI models, including Gemini 1.5 Pro, the latest in Google\u2019s Gemini series.\n\nLlama 3 70B beats Gemini 1.5 Pro on MMLU, HumanEval and GSM-8K, and \u2014 while it doesn\u2019t rival Anthropic\u2019s most performant model, Claude 3 Opus \u2014 Llama 3 70B scores better than the second-weakest model in the Claude 3 series, Claude 3 Sonnet, on five benchmarks (MMLU, GPQA, HumanEval, GSM-8K and MATH).\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Meta also developed its own test set covering use cases ranging from coding and creative writing to reasoning to summarization, and \u2014 surprise! \u2014 Llama 3 70B came out on top against Mistral\u2019s Mistral Medium model, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3.5 and Claude Sonnet. Meta says that it gated its modeling teams from accessing the set to maintain objectivity, but obviously \u2014 given that Meta itself devised the test \u2014 the results have to be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nMore qualitatively, Meta says that users of the new Llama models should expect more \u201csteerability,\u201d a lower likelihood to refuse to answer questions, and higher accuracy on trivia questions, questions pertaining to history and STEM fields such as engineering and science and general coding recommendations. That\u2019s in part thanks to a much larger dataset: a collection of 15 trillion tokens, or a mind-boggling ~750,000,000,000 words \u2014 seven times the size of the Llama 2 training set. (In the AI field, \u201ctokens\u201d refers to subdivided bits of raw data, like the syllables \u201cfan,\u201d \u201ctas\u201d and \u201ctic\u201d in the word \u201cfantastic.\u201d)\n\nWhere did this data come from? Good question. Meta wouldn\u2019t say, revealing only that it drew from \u201cpublicly available sources,\u201d included four times more code than in the Llama 2 training dataset and that 5% of that set has non-English data (in ~30 languages) to improve performance on languages other than English. Meta also said it used synthetic data \u2014 i.e. AI-generated data \u2014 to create longer documents for the Llama 3 models to train on, a somewhat controversial approach due to the potential performance drawbacks.\n\n\u201cWhile the models we\u2019re releasing today are only fine tuned for English outputs, the increased data diversity helps the models better recognize nuances and patterns, and perform strongly across a variety of tasks,\u201d Meta writes in a blog post shared with TechCrunch.\n\nMany generative AI vendors see training data as a competitive advantage and thus keep it and info pertaining to it close to the chest. But training data details are also a potential source of IP-related lawsuits, another disincentive to reveal much. Recent reporting revealed that Meta, in its quest to maintain pace with AI rivals, at one point used copyrighted e-books for AI training despite the company\u2019s own lawyers\u2019 warnings; Meta and OpenAI are the subject of an ongoing lawsuit brought by authors including comedian Sarah Silverman over the vendors\u2019 alleged unauthorized use of copyrighted data for training.\n\nSo what about toxicity and bias, two other common problems with generative AI models (including Llama 2)? Does Llama 3 improve in those areas? Yes, claims Meta.\n\nMeta says that it developed new data-filtering pipelines to boost the quality of its model training data, and that it has updated its pair of generative AI safety suites, Llama Guard and CybersecEval, to attempt to prevent the misuse of and unwanted text generations from Llama 3 models and others. The company\u2019s also releasing a new tool, Code Shield, designed to detect code from generative AI models that might introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\nFiltering isn\u2019t foolproof, though \u2014 and tools like Llama Guard, CyberSecEval and Code Shield only go so far. (See: Llama 2\u2019s tendency to make up answers to questions and leak private health and financial information.) We\u2019ll have to wait and see how the Llama 3 models perform in the wild, inclusive of testing from academics on alternative benchmarks.\n\nMeta says that the Llama 3 models \u2014 which are available for download now, and powering Meta\u2019s Meta AI assistant on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and the web \u2014 will soon be hosted in managed form across a wide range of cloud platforms including AWS, Databricks, Google Cloud, Hugging Face, Kaggle, IBM\u2019s WatsonX, Microsoft Azure, Nvidia\u2019s NIM and Snowflake. In the future, versions of the models optimized for hardware from AMD, AWS, Dell, Intel, Nvidia and Qualcomm will also be made available.\n\nThe Llama 3 models might be widely available. But you\u2019ll notice that we\u2019re using \u201copen\u201d to describe them as opposed to \u201copen source.\u201d That\u2019s because, despite Meta\u2019s claims, its Llama family of models aren\u2019t as no-strings-attached as it\u2019d have people believe. Yes, they\u2019re available for both research and commercial applications.

{"title": "Don\u2019t blame MKBHD for the fate of Humane AI and Fisker", "text": "Don\u2019t blame MKBHD for the fate of Humane AI and Fisker Famed YouTuber Marques Brownlee makes a splash not for what he said \u2014 but for how\n\nHumane AI raised more than $230 million before it even shipped a product. And when it finally released its Ai Pin \u2014 which costs $699 plus a $24 monthly subscription \u2014 pretty much every tech reviewer came to the same disappointing realization: This much-hyped product, which promises to disrupt the smartphone\u2019s dominance, is not very good.\n\nYet some onlookers are declaring that Marques Brownlee, the hugely popular YouTuber known as MKBHD, will be single-handedly responsible if the company eventually fails. Soon after Humane AI dropped its long-awaited product, the conversation evolved away from the product itself and instead toward how Brownlee spoke about it in his own review.\n\nBrownlee\u2019s video title is admittedly a bit clicky: \u201cThe Worst Product I\u2019ve Ever Reviewed\u2026 For Now.\u201d But when you watch the actual video, the title delivers on its promise.\n\n\u201cIt was really hard to come up with a title for this video,\u201d Brownlee says in the review, which currently has over 5 million views. \u201cBut I will say, at one point, my working title for this was, \u2018This product is either the dumbest thing ever, or I\u2019m an idiot.\u2019\u201d\n\nBrownlee is unusually influential, with over 18 million YouTube subscribers, but his critiques are on par with other reviewers\u2019 commentary: The pin has bad battery life. It is difficult to wear. It makes mistakes too often to be reliable. Its laser projection screen is completely ineffective outdoors. And it\u2019s simply not worth the same sticker price as an Android phone.\n\nStill, the review kicked off a maelstrom on social media.\n\n\u201cI find it distasteful, almost unethical, to say this when you have 18 million subscribers,\u201d former AWS engineer Daniel Vassallo wrote on X on Sunday. \u201cHard to explain why, but with great reach comes great responsibility. Potentially killing someone else\u2019s nascent project reeks of carelessness. First, do no harm.\u201d\n\nAnother tech content creator, Alex Finn, wrote on X: \u201cMKBHD bankrupted a company in 41 seconds,\u201d referring to the opening of his video. Finn later added, \u201cIf this video never came out, they would have sold so many more.\u201d\n\nAs the conversation picked up steam, MKBHD tweeted back to Vassallo, saying, \u201cWe disagree on what my job is.\u201d\n\nWhen reached for comment, Vassallo said, \u201cMany people thought I was defending Humane or its product. I wasn\u2019t. My observation was about MKBHD\u2019s scale of influence and how that power deserves more rigor than the sensational headline on YouTube: \u2018The Worst Product I\u2019ve Ever Reviewed.\u2019 The power to crush a company shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly, and that headline is what most people will see. The actual review was fair and balanced.\u201d\n\nAn underdog worth $800 million\n\nCritics of MKBHD\u2019s video are operating as though Humane AI is an underdog in the space. But this isn\u2019t a green, early-stage startup trying its hand at building new hardware. This is a company that raised a Series C round and attracted investors like Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and various top venture capital firms before consumers even got their hands on the product.\n\n\u201cCall me cynical, but I\u2019m wary of startups with huge war chests of capital but no commercialized product to speak of,\u201d TechCrunch reporter Kyle Wiggers wrote after last year\u2019s Series C raise.\n\nWhen asked for comment, MKBHD directed TechCrunch to his newer YouTube response to the situation.\n\n\u201cAll that any honest review actually does is just accelerate whatever was already going on,\u201d he says in the video.\n\nLess than a day after posting it, the follow-up video has over 2 million views.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an isolated incident for MKBHD. The YouTuber was also accused of inciting the downfall of EV startup Fisker after he negatively reviewed the Fisker Ocean car in a similarly titled video last month: \u201cThis is the Worst Car I\u2019ve Ever Reviewed.\u201d\n\nAfter Brownlee posted his review, Fisker laid off 15% of its staff and stopped production. But Fisker was already in free fall before Brownlee said that the Fisker Ocean was the worst car he\u2019d ever reviewed. Indeed, at the time, it revealed in a regulatory filing spied by TechCrunch that it had just $121 million left in the bank.\n\nMore, in the month preceding the MKBHD review, federal safety regulators began investigating the Fisker Ocean for complaints about the brakes not working well. TechCrunch separately learned that Ocean drivers had been complaining to Fisker about poor brake performance, faulty key fobs and sudden power loss for months. One customer wrote to Fisker that they feared for their life when their car suddenly lost power while driving on the 405 freeway in Los Angeles.\n\nSo is Fisker failing because it put out a dangerously poor product, or is it because a very popular YouTuber said that the car is bad?\n\nThankfully, Humane AI\u2019s subpar pin won\u2019t put anyone in mortal danger. But these parallel incidents display the same misplaced rage at Brownlee over his honest critique of troublesome products.\n\nAn uncomfortable yet familiar critique\n\nSome Black techies viewed the critique of MKBHD through a different lens. \u201cIf Brownlee were anything other than Black, this would be \u2018an honest review that shines a light on the AI bubble,\u2019\u201d one Black founder told TechCrunch. \u201cInstead, he\u2019s \u2018harsh,\u2019 and \u2018it\u2019s not fair that he can bankrupt such a well-funded company. He should be more graceful in his critique.\u2019 In a world full of shams and frauds, Marques should do exactly what he thinks is right. And he did.\u201d\n\nSome also observed in criticisms of Brownlee\u2019s review so-called tone policing, a technique used to dismiss especially what Black people say based on how a message is delivered versus the content of the message.\n\nIndeed, one Black investor observed to TechCrunch that Brownlee\u2019s review hits on two biases in tech: \u201cTech has issues with bias against Black people. Tech has issues with the media being a critic [and] not a cheerleader, so of course, tech has issues with a Black tech media take that is critical of fanboy topics like AI and IoT.\u201d\n\nEither way, it\u2019s notable that a YouTuber is perceived as having the power to make or break a company.\n\nIn an interview with fellow YouTuber interviewers Colin and Samir last week, Brownlee reflected on a past era of media when tech reviewers at The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times were some of the only voices that consumers sought out for their opinions on new tech.

{"title": "Don\u2019t blame MKBHD for the fate of Humane AI and Fisker", "text": "Don\u2019t blame MKBHD for the fate of Humane AI and Fisker Famed YouTuber Marques Brownlee makes a splash not for what he said \u2014 but for how\n\nHumane AI raised more than $230 million before it even shipped a product. And when it finally released its Ai Pin \u2014 which costs $699 plus a $24 monthly subscription \u2014 pretty much every tech reviewer came to the same disappointing realization: This much-hyped product, which promises to disrupt the smartphone\u2019s dominance, is not very good.\n\nYet some onlookers are declaring that Marques Brownlee, the hugely popular YouTuber known as MKBHD, will be single-handedly responsible if the company eventually fails. Soon after Humane AI dropped its long-awaited product, the conversation evolved away from the product itself and instead toward how Brownlee spoke about it in his own review.\n\nBrownlee\u2019s video title is admittedly a bit clicky: \u201cThe Worst Product I\u2019ve Ever Reviewed\u2026 For Now.\u201d But when you watch the actual video, the title delivers on its promise.\n\n\u201cIt was really hard to come up with a title for this video,\u201d Brownlee says in the review, which currently has over 5 million views. \u201cBut I will say, at one point, my working title for this was, \u2018This product is either the dumbest thing ever, or I\u2019m an idiot.\u2019\u201d\n\nBrownlee is unusually influential, with over 18 million YouTube subscribers, but his critiques are on par with other reviewers\u2019 commentary: The pin has bad battery life. It is difficult to wear. It makes mistakes too often to be reliable. Its laser projection screen is completely ineffective outdoors. And it\u2019s simply not worth the same sticker price as an Android phone.\n\nStill, the review kicked off a maelstrom on social media.\n\n\u201cI find it distasteful, almost unethical, to say this when you have 18 million subscribers,\u201d former AWS engineer Daniel Vassallo wrote on X on Sunday. \u201cHard to explain why, but with great reach comes great responsibility. Potentially killing someone else\u2019s nascent project reeks of carelessness. First, do no harm.\u201d\n\nAnother tech content creator, Alex Finn, wrote on X: \u201cMKBHD bankrupted a company in 41 seconds,\u201d referring to the opening of his video. Finn later added, \u201cIf this video never came out, they would have sold so many more.\u201d\n\nAs the conversation picked up steam, MKBHD tweeted back to Vassallo, saying, \u201cWe disagree on what my job is.\u201d\n\nWhen reached for comment, Vassallo said, \u201cMany people thought I was defending Humane or its product. I wasn\u2019t. My observation was about MKBHD\u2019s scale of influence and how that power deserves more rigor than the sensational headline on YouTube: \u2018The Worst Product I\u2019ve Ever Reviewed.\u2019 The power to crush a company shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly, and that headline is what most people will see. The actual review was fair and balanced.\u201d\n\nAn underdog worth $800 million\n\nCritics of MKBHD\u2019s video are operating as though Humane AI is an underdog in the space. But this isn\u2019t a green, early-stage startup trying its hand at building new hardware. This is a company that raised a Series C round and attracted investors like Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and various top venture capital firms before consumers even got their hands on the product.\n\n\u201cCall me cynical, but I\u2019m wary of startups with huge war chests of capital but no commercialized product to speak of,\u201d TechCrunch reporter Kyle Wiggers wrote after last year\u2019s Series C raise.\n\nWhen asked for comment, MKBHD directed TechCrunch to his newer YouTube response to the situation.\n\n\u201cAll that any honest review actually does is just accelerate whatever was already going on,\u201d he says in the video.\n\nLess than a day after posting it, the follow-up video has over 2 million views.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an isolated incident for MKBHD. The YouTuber was also accused of inciting the downfall of EV startup Fisker after he negatively reviewed the Fisker Ocean car in a similarly titled video last month: \u201cThis is the Worst Car I\u2019ve Ever Reviewed.\u201d\n\nAfter Brownlee posted his review, Fisker laid off 15% of its staff and stopped production. But Fisker was already in free fall before Brownlee said that the Fisker Ocean was the worst car he\u2019d ever reviewed. Indeed, at the time, it revealed in a regulatory filing spied by TechCrunch that it had just $121 million left in the bank.\n\nMore, in the month preceding the MKBHD review, federal safety regulators began investigating the Fisker Ocean for complaints about the brakes not working well. TechCrunch separately learned that Ocean drivers had been complaining to Fisker about poor brake performance, faulty key fobs and sudden power loss for months. One customer wrote to Fisker that they feared for their life when their car suddenly lost power while driving on the 405 freeway in Los Angeles.\n\nSo is Fisker failing because it put out a dangerously poor product, or is it because a very popular YouTuber said that the car is bad?\n\nThankfully, Humane AI\u2019s subpar pin won\u2019t put anyone in mortal danger. But these parallel incidents display the same misplaced rage at Brownlee over his honest critique of troublesome products.\n\nAn uncomfortable yet familiar critique\n\nSome Black techies viewed the critique of MKBHD through a different lens. \u201cIf Brownlee were anything other than Black, this would be \u2018an honest review that shines a light on the AI bubble,\u2019\u201d one Black founder told TechCrunch. \u201cInstead, he\u2019s \u2018harsh,\u2019 and \u2018it\u2019s not fair that he can bankrupt such a well-funded company. He should be more graceful in his critique.\u2019 In a world full of shams and frauds, Marques should do exactly what he thinks is right. And he did.\u201d\n\nSome also observed in criticisms of Brownlee\u2019s review so-called tone policing, a technique used to dismiss especially what Black people say based on how a message is delivered versus the content of the message.\n\nIndeed, one Black investor observed to TechCrunch that Brownlee\u2019s review hits on two biases in tech: \u201cTech has issues with bias against Black people. Tech has issues with the media being a critic [and] not a cheerleader, so of course, tech has issues with a Black tech media take that is critical of fanboy topics like AI and IoT.\u201d\n\nEither way, it\u2019s notable that a YouTuber is perceived as having the power to make or break a company.\n\nIn an interview with fellow YouTuber interviewers Colin and Samir last week, Brownlee reflected on a past era of media when tech reviewers at The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times were some of the only voices that consumers sought out for their opinions on new tech. Now, anyone on the internet can have a say, regardless of their institutional affiliation.\n\n\u201cWhen a YouTube video of mine goes up on a product, there are very frequently hundreds others going up on the same product around the same time,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are so many more voices now.\u201d", "authors": "['Dominic-Madori Davis', 'Amanda Silberling']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1259137127.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "LinkedIn testing Premium Company Page subscription with AI-assisted content creation", "text": "LinkedIn \u2014 the social platform that targets the working world \u2014 has quietly started testing another way to boost its revenues, this time with a new service for small and medium businesses. TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that it is working on a new LinkedIn Premium Company Page subscription, which \u2014 for fees that appear to be as steep as $99/month \u2014 will include AI to write content and new tools to grow follower counts, among other features to raise the profiles of the company using them.\n\nThe move is significant because it underscores how Microsoft-owned LinkedIn continues to diversify its business model \u2014 while also trying to make itself more useful overall. For years LinkedIn has been the butt of many a joke about how it can feel like a cesspool of shameless self-promotion, or (cue nervous laughter) creepy when you realize the amount of data it can gather about what you do on there.\n\nBut as others have pointed out, LinkedIn has a prime opportunity right now. With so many changes underfoot on other social platforms and search engines \u2014 where advertising and other algorithms dictate what users discover, and where disinformation runs riot \u2014 LinkedIn has been looking to carve out a safer space, a place to have a social profile of record for the professionals and prosumers out there.\n\nLinkedIn quietly started to post information describing its new Premium Company Page six days ago. The posts got almost no notice, but we stumbled on it ourselves, and it seems a marketing consultant did, too. Now LinkedIn has confirmed the details to TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always exploring new ways to enhance our customers\u2019 experience and assist them in achieving their business goals. Currently, we\u2019re testing a new offering with small-to-medium business customers, called Premium Company Page, which is designed to help them attract customers, build credibility, and stand out to their audience. We look forward to sharing more soon,\u201d said Suzi Owens, senior director of communications at LinkedIn, in a statement.\n\nPricing for premium company pages is not immediately disclosed, but it appears admins of pages that are eligible for it can see it. This marketing consultant notes that the fees start at $99.99 per month per Page, reducing to $839.88 per Page for an annual subscription.\n\nThis new premium company page is the latest in a growing list of premium offerings that LinkedIn has crafted for organizations on the platform, mirroring the different usage and pricing tiers that it has built out for individuals and recruiters using the platform.\n\nOther business-focused tiers include Premium Career for people on the job hunt, Premium Business for business intelligence, Sales Navigator for sales teams, Recruiter tiers for sourcing and hiring talent and LinkedIn Learning for professional development.\n\nTaken together, Premium services are very big business for the company. In March, the company announced that Premium user subscriptions grew 25% year-on-year to $1.7 billion in 2023. Overall, the company made $15 billion that year, with its recruiting business accounting for $7 billion of that.\n\nThe Premium Company Page subscription in some ways will look very familiar, in that it taps into well-known LinkedIn mechanics.\n\nAdmins for the pages can review recent visitors \u2014 if those visitors have not turned off the privacy setting, that is. (Public service reminder: it\u2019s on by default.) This can be used to subsequently invite those visitors to follow the page, regardless of their degree of connection (that previously would have been impossible to do for casual visitors who are not already connected within one degree of the company). Admins can also create \u201ccall to action\u201d buttons with contact or website details displayed prominently at the top of the Page. Testimonials, which LinkedIn has really promoted as a feature on profile pages for individuals, also get a push here: Admins can display these prominently at the top of their premium pages.\n\nThe AI writing help, meanwhile, becomes one of the latest ways that LinkedIn is weaving more AI assistance into the platform, something it started to introduce last year, tapping Microsoft\u2019s ties to OpenAI.\n\nLast but not least, with LinkedIn big on verification lately, a Page can get a golden badge with a premium subscription.", "authors": "['Jagmeet Singh', 'Ingrid Lunden']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/linkedin-getty.jpg?w=1200", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "LinkedIn testing Premium Company Page subscription with AI-assisted content creation", "text": "LinkedIn \u2014 the social platform that targets the working world \u2014 has quietly started testing another way to boost its revenues, this time with a new service for small and medium businesses. TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that it is working on a new LinkedIn Premium Company Page subscription, which \u2014 for fees that appear to be as steep as $99/month \u2014 will include AI to write content and new tools to grow follower counts, among other features to raise the profiles of the company using them.\n\nThe move is significant because it underscores how Microsoft-owned LinkedIn continues to diversify its business model \u2014 while also trying to make itself more useful overall. For years LinkedIn has been the butt of many a joke about how it can feel like a cesspool of shameless self-promotion, or (cue nervous laughter) creepy when you realize the amount of data it can gather about what you do on there.\n\nBut as others have pointed out, LinkedIn has a prime opportunity right now. With so many changes underfoot on other social platforms and search engines \u2014 where advertising and other algorithms dictate what users discover, and where disinformation runs riot \u2014 LinkedIn has been looking to carve out a safer space, a place to have a social profile of record for the professionals and prosumers out there.\n\nLinkedIn quietly started to post information describing its new Premium Company Page six days ago. The posts got almost no notice, but we stumbled on it ourselves, and it seems a marketing consultant did, too. Now LinkedIn has confirmed the details to TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always exploring new ways to enhance our customers\u2019 experience and assist them in achieving their business goals. Currently, we\u2019re testing a new offering with small-to-medium business customers, called Premium Company Page, which is designed to help them attract customers, build credibility, and stand out to their audience. We look forward to sharing more soon,\u201d said Suzi Owens, senior director of communications at LinkedIn, in a statement.\n\nPricing for premium company pages is not immediately disclosed, but it appears admins of pages that are eligible for it can see it. This marketing consultant notes that the fees start at $99.99 per month per Page, reducing to $839.88 per Page for an annual subscription.\n\nThis new premium company page is the latest in a growing list of premium offerings that LinkedIn has crafted for organizations on the platform, mirroring the different usage and pricing tiers that it has built out for individuals and recruiters using the platform.\n\nOther business-focused tiers include Premium Career for people on the job hunt, Premium Business for business intelligence, Sales Navigator for sales teams, Recruiter tiers for sourcing and hiring talent and LinkedIn Learning for professional development.\n\nTaken together, Premium services are very big business for the company. In March, the company announced that Premium user subscriptions grew 25% year-on-year to $1.7 billion in 2023. Overall, the company made $15 billion that year, with its recruiting business accounting for $7 billion of that.\n\nThe Premium Company Page subscription in some ways will look very familiar, in that it taps into well-known LinkedIn mechanics.\n\nAdmins for the pages can review recent visitors \u2014 if those visitors have not turned off the privacy setting, that is. (Public service reminder: it\u2019s on by default.) This can be used to subsequently invite those visitors to follow the page, regardless of their degree of connection (that previously would have been impossible to do for casual visitors who are not already connected within one degree of the company). Admins can also create \u201ccall to action\u201d buttons with contact or website details displayed prominently at the top of the Page. Testimonials, which LinkedIn has really promoted as a feature on profile pages for individuals, also get a push here: Admins can display these prominently at the top of their premium pages.\n\nThe AI writing help, meanwhile, becomes one of the latest ways that LinkedIn is weaving more AI assistance into the platform, something it started to introduce last year, tapping Microsoft\u2019s ties to OpenAI.\n\nLast but not least, with LinkedIn big on verification lately, a Page can get a golden badge with a premium subscription.", "authors": "['Jagmeet Singh', 'Ingrid Lunden']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/linkedin-getty.jpg?w=1200", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/17/boston-dynamics-atlas-humanoid-robot-goes-electric/
{"title": "Boston Dynamics\u2019 Atlas humanoid robot goes electric", "text": "Atlas lies motionless in a prone position atop interlocking gym mats. The only soundtrack is the whirring of an electric motor. It\u2019s not quiet, exactly, but it\u2019s nothing compared to the hydraulic jerks of its ancestors.\n\nAs the camera pans around the robot\u2019s back, its legs bend at the knees. It\u2019s a natural movement, at first, before crossing into an uncanny realm, like something out of a Sam Raimi movie. The robot, which appeared to be lying on its back, has effectively switched positions with this clever bit of leg rotation.\n\nAs Atlas fully stands, it does so with its back to the camera. Now the head spins around 180 degrees, before the torso follows suit. It stands for a moment, offering the camera its first clear view of its head \u2014 a ring light forming the perimeter of a perfectly round screen. Once again, the torso follows the head\u2019s 180, as Atlas walks away from the camera and out of frame.\n\nA day after retiring the hydraulic version of its humanoid robot, Boston Dynamics just announced that \u2014 like Bob Dylan before it \u2014 Atlas just went electric.\n\nThe pace is fast, the steps still a bit jerky \u2014 though significantly more fluid than many of the new commercial humanoids to which we\u2019ve been introduced over the past couple of years. If anything, the gait brings to mind the brash confidence of Spot, Atlas\u2019 cousin whose branch on the evolutionary tree forked off from the humanoid a few generations ago.\n\nAll-new Atlas\n\nThe new version of the robot is virtually unrecognizable. Gone is the top-heavy torso, the bowed legs and plated armor. There are no exposed cables anywhere to be found on the svelte new mechanical skeleton. The company, which has warded off reactionary complaints of robopocalypse for decades, has opted for a kinder, gentler design than both the original Atlas and more contemporary robots like the Figure 01 and Tesla Optimus.\n\nThe new robot\u2019s aesthetic more closely matches that of Agility\u2019s Digit and Apptronik\u2019s Apollo. There\u2019s a softer, more cartoonish design to the traffic-light-headed robot. It\u2019s the \u201cAll New Atlas,\u201d according to the video. Boston Dynamics has bucked its own trend by maintaining the research name for a product it will be positioning toward commercialization. SpotMini became Spot. Handle became Stretch. For now, however, Atlas is still Atlas.\n\n\u201cWe might revisit this when we really get ready to build and deliver in quantity,\u201d Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter tells TechCrunch. \u201cBut I think for now, maintaining the branding is worthwhile.\u201d\n\nThe executive\u2019s statement betrays the still early stages of the project. Boston Dynamics\u2019 current timeline has the electric Atlas beginning pilot testing at Hyundai facilities earlier next year, with full production a few years further down the road.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be doing experiments with Hyundai on-site, beginning next year,\u201d says Playter. \u201cWe already have equipment from Hyundai on-site. We\u2019ve been working on this for a while. To make this successful, you have to have a lot more than just cool tech. You really have to understand that use case, you\u2019ve got to have sufficient productivity to make investment in a robot worthwhile.\u201d\n\nDoing a 180\n\nWhat\u2019s most striking about the 40-second \u201cAll New Atlas\u201d teaser is the robot\u2019s movements. They\u2019re a reminder that building a humanoid robot doesn\u2019t require making the robot as human as possible. As an investor pointed out to me years back, billions of years of evolution hasn\u2019t made us humans perfect machines. If we are going to create machines in our own images, why not build ones that can do things we can\u2019t?\n\n\u201cWe built a set of custom, high-powered and very flexible actuators at most joints,\u201d says Playter. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge range of motion. That really packs the power of an elite athlete into this tiny package, and we\u2019ve used that package all over the robot.\u201d\n\nOne thing worth keeping in mind while watching the footage is that Boston Dynamics has made its name across decades of viral videos. Recent additions to the canon are just as likely to showcase a \u2019bot\u2019s dance moves as they are anything genuinely useful in an industrial setting. For that reason, it\u2019s difficult to decouple what the company has deemed real functionality and what is just a bit of showing off.\n\nStarting in the prone position, for instance, is an opportunity to showcase that cool reverse crab leg trick \u2014 but it\u2019s practical, as well. As Boston Dynamics was more than happy to showcase in the hydraulic Atlas\u2019 farewell video, falling down is part of the job \u2014 and so, too, is getting up. The truth of the matter is that most of the current crop of industrial robots require human intervention when they fail. A robot that can simply dust itself off and get back to work, on the other hand, is a big win for productivity.\n\nThe system\u2019s ability to turn on a dime also lends considerably to its productivity potential. It brings to mind Agility\u2019s Digit demos (the company is notably the only one of its ilk demoing systems at this scale), wherein a robot walks to a shelf, turns around, walks to the conveyer belt, turns around and walks back. Multiply that job by hundreds \u2014 or even thousands \u2014 of times a day, and you begin to see the value of shaving off precious seconds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be capable of a set of motions that people aren\u2019t,\u201d explains Playter. \u201cThere will be very practical uses for that.\u201d\n\nSignificantly reducing the robot\u2019s turn radius is also important in tight spaces. Remember, these machines are meant to be brownfield solutions \u2014 that is, they\u2019re designed to be plugged into existing workflows in existing spaces. Increased maneuverability could ultimately mean the difference between working in a setting and having to redo the layout.\n\nHead and hands\n\nThe hands aren\u2019t brand new for the video, having previously made appearances on the hydraulic model. They do, however, also represent the company\u2019s decision to not hew entirely to human design as a guiding force. Here, the difference is as simple as opting for three fingers, instead of four on the end effectors.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much complexity in a hand,\u201d says Playter. \u201cWhen you\u2019re banging up against the world with actuators, you have to be prepared for reliability and robustness. So, we designed these with fewer than five fingers to try to control their complexity. We\u2019re continuing to explore generations of those. We want compliant grasping, adapting to a variety of shapes with rich sensing on board, so you understand when you\u2019re in contact.\n\nInternally, the most contentious aspect of the design may well be the head. The big, round display has shades of a cosmetic mirror.\n\n\u201cIt was one of the design elements we fretted over quite a bit,\u201d says Playter. \u201cEverybody else had a sort of humanoid shape. I wanted it to be different. We want it to be friendly and open. It provides a palette for a display. Of course, there are sensors buried in there, but also the shape is really intended to indicate some friendliness. That will be important for interacting with these things in the future.\u201d\n\nAn Atlas for Christmas\n\nThe landscape has changed dramatically in the decade since the hydraulic Atlas\u2019 introduction. Electric Atlas has a fair bit of company, in the form of humanoid robots from Figure, Apptronik, Tesla and 1X, among others.\n\n\u201cFor us, there\u2019s obviously been a huge influx of interest. I think that influx has been motivated by three events. Boston Dynamics got acquired [by Hyundai] for nearly a billion dollars. That sort of woke everybody up like, \u2018whoa, there\u2019s an exit path.\u2019 Tesla expressing interest in manufacturing sort of validated things we\u2019ve been doing for a long time. And then, the emergence of AI as a tool to help deal with generality is making all of this feasible. We\u2019ve been patient to announce, because we wanted to do enough research to understand that we can solve manipulation problems and be confident in a new generation of machine.\n\nIn spite of Boston Dynamics\u2019 big head start in humanoids, Playter says the company got the new robot\u2019s first build together around Christmas 2023. Before that, it was working through many of the more complex problems in simulation.\n\nThis week, it seems, the company is finally ready to begin showing off what the robot can do \u2014 or at least the early stages of what it\u2019s planning with the system.\n\nGeneral intelligence\n\nOne thing you can definitely say about Elon Musk is the guy makes big promises. In the earliest public-facing days of Optimus, when the Tesla \u2019bot appeared to be little more than a spandex-clad human, the executive spoke of a system that could do it all. Your Optimus could work all day in the factory, do your grocery shopping and then cook you dinner. That\u2019s the dream, right?\n\nThe truth of the matter is, of course, one built around baby steps. Robotics firms may already be discussing \u201cgeneral-purpose humanoids,\u201d but their systems are scaling one task at a time. For most, that means moving payloads from point A to B. Truly utilizing the form factor, however, will require a more generalized intelligence.\n\nIt appears the app store model might present the clearest path there. Developer access has, after all, been a big part of growing out Spot\u2019s feature set. Playter, however, says Boston Dynamics won\u2019t be taking that approach with Atlas.\n\n\u201cWe are definitely going to target an application ourself and not build a platform,\u201d he says. Our experience is that the way to go fast is for us to focus on an application and go solve problems \u2014 and not assume someone else is going to solve it for us. I do think AI is an essential piece here. To support the generality of tasks is going to take and will be reinforced with AI techniques.\u201d\n\nThe company recently opened access to Spot\u2019s reinforcement learning algorithm for developers. That work will be foundational to Atlas\u2019 growing skillset.\n\nOutside the box\n\nTo be successful, Playter explains, humanoids have to move beyond the boxes.\n\n\u201cI think you can do that with so many other robots,\u201d he says. \u201cHumanoids need to be able to support a huge generality of tasks. You\u2019ve got two hands. You want to be able to pick up complex, heavy geometric shapes that a simple box picker could not pick up \u2014 and you\u2019ve got to do hundreds of thousands of those. I think the single-task robot is a thing of the past. Stretch is one of the last applications where you can have a robot just moving around boxes and make it work.\u201d\n\nIf not boxes, what will the new Atlas be tasked with on the Hyundai show floor? The answer can be found in a video posted by the company back in February, which saw the hydraulic version of the robot interacting with car struts \u2014 the Hyundai components to which Playter alluded to earlier.\n\n\u201cOur long history in dynamic mobility means we\u2019re strong and we know how to accommodate a heavy payload and still maintain tremendous mobility,\u201d he says. \u201cI think that\u2019s going to be a differentiator for us, being able to pick up heavy, complex, massive things. That strut in the video probably weighs 25 pounds. Picking up wheels \u2014 we\u2019ll launch a video later as part of this whole effort showing a little bit more of the manipulation tasks with real-world objects we\u2019ve been doing with Atlas. I\u2019m confident we know how to do that part, and I haven\u2019t seen others doing that yet.\u201d", "authors": "['Brian Heater']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DSC07581243.jpg?resize=1200,800", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "Boston Dynamics\u2019 Atlas humanoid robot goes electric", "text": "Atlas lies motionless in a prone position atop interlocking gym mats. The only soundtrack is the whirring of an electric motor. It\u2019s not quiet, exactly, but it\u2019s nothing compared to the hydraulic jerks of its ancestors.\n\nAs the camera pans around the robot\u2019s back, its legs bend at the knees. It\u2019s a natural movement, at first, before crossing into an uncanny realm, like something out of a Sam Raimi movie. The robot, which appeared to be lying on its back, has effectively switched positions with this clever bit of leg rotation.\n\nAs Atlas fully stands, it does so with its back to the camera. Now the head spins around 180 degrees, before the torso follows suit. It stands for a moment, offering the camera its first clear view of its head \u2014 a ring light forming the perimeter of a perfectly round screen. Once again, the torso follows the head\u2019s 180, as Atlas walks away from the camera and out of frame.\n\nA day after retiring the hydraulic version of its humanoid robot, Boston Dynamics just announced that \u2014 like Bob Dylan before it \u2014 Atlas just went electric.\n\nThe pace is fast, the steps still a bit jerky \u2014 though significantly more fluid than many of the new commercial humanoids to which we\u2019ve been introduced over the past couple of years. If anything, the gait brings to mind the brash confidence of Spot, Atlas\u2019 cousin whose branch on the evolutionary tree forked off from the humanoid a few generations ago.\n\nAll-new Atlas\n\nThe new version of the robot is virtually unrecognizable. Gone is the top-heavy torso, the bowed legs and plated armor. There are no exposed cables anywhere to be found on the svelte new mechanical skeleton. The company, which has warded off reactionary complaints of robopocalypse for decades, has opted for a kinder, gentler design than both the original Atlas and more contemporary robots like the Figure 01 and Tesla Optimus.\n\nThe new robot\u2019s aesthetic more closely matches that of Agility\u2019s Digit and Apptronik\u2019s Apollo. There\u2019s a softer, more cartoonish design to the traffic-light-headed robot. It\u2019s the \u201cAll New Atlas,\u201d according to the video. Boston Dynamics has bucked its own trend by maintaining the research name for a product it will be positioning toward commercialization. SpotMini became Spot. Handle became Stretch. For now, however, Atlas is still Atlas.\n\n\u201cWe might revisit this when we really get ready to build and deliver in quantity,\u201d Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter tells TechCrunch. \u201cBut I think for now, maintaining the branding is worthwhile.\u201d\n\nThe executive\u2019s statement betrays the still early stages of the project. Boston Dynamics\u2019 current timeline has the electric Atlas beginning pilot testing at Hyundai facilities earlier next year, with full production a few years further down the road.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be doing experiments with Hyundai on-site, beginning next year,\u201d says Playter. \u201cWe already have equipment from Hyundai on-site. We\u2019ve been working on this for a while. To make this successful, you have to have a lot more than just cool tech. You really have to understand that use case, you\u2019ve got to have sufficient productivity to make investment in a robot worthwhile.\u201d\n\nDoing a 180\n\nWhat\u2019s most striking about the 40-second \u201cAll New Atlas\u201d teaser is the robot\u2019s movements. They\u2019re a reminder that building a humanoid robot doesn\u2019t require making the robot as human as possible. As an investor pointed out to me years back, billions of years of evolution hasn\u2019t made us humans perfect machines. If we are going to create machines in our own images, why not build ones that can do things we can\u2019t?\n\n\u201cWe built a set of custom, high-powered and very flexible actuators at most joints,\u201d says Playter. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge range of motion. That really packs the power of an elite athlete into this tiny package, and we\u2019ve used that package all over the robot.\u201d\n\nOne thing worth keeping in mind while watching the footage is that Boston Dynamics has made its name across decades of viral videos. Recent additions to the canon are just as likely to showcase a \u2019bot\u2019s dance moves as they are anything genuinely useful in an industrial setting. For that reason, it\u2019s difficult to decouple what the company has deemed real functionality and what is just a bit of showing off.\n\nStarting in the prone position, for instance, is an opportunity to showcase that cool reverse crab leg trick \u2014 but it\u2019s practical, as well. As Boston Dynamics was more than happy to showcase in the hydraulic Atlas\u2019 farewell video, falling down is part of the job \u2014 and so, too, is getting up. The truth of the matter is that most of the current crop of industrial robots require human intervention when they fail. A robot that can simply dust itself off and get back to work, on the other hand, is a big win for productivity.\n\nThe system\u2019s ability to turn on a dime also lends considerably to its productivity potential. It brings to mind Agility\u2019s Digit demos (the company is notably the only one of its ilk demoing systems at this scale), wherein a robot walks to a shelf, turns around, walks to the conveyer belt, turns around and walks back. Multiply that job by hundreds \u2014 or even thousands \u2014 of times a day, and you begin to see the value of shaving off precious seconds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be capable of a set of motions that people aren\u2019t,\u201d explains Playter. \u201cThere will be very practical uses for that.\u201d\n\nSignificantly reducing the robot\u2019s turn radius is also important in tight spaces. Remember, these machines are meant to be brownfield solutions \u2014 that is, they\u2019re designed to be plugged into existing workflows in existing spaces. Increased maneuverability could ultimately mean the difference between working in a setting and having to redo the layout.\n\nHead and hands\n\nThe hands aren\u2019t brand new for the video, having previously made appearances on the hydraulic model. They do, however, also represent the company\u2019s decision to not hew entirely to human design as a guiding force. Here, the difference is as simple as opting for three fingers, instead of four on the end effectors.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much complexity in a hand,\u201d says Playter. \u201cWhen you\u2019re banging up against the world with actuators, you have to be prepared for reliability and robustness. So, we designed these with fewer than five fingers to try to control their complexity. We\u2019re continuing to explore generations of those. We want compliant grasping, adapting to a variety of shapes with rich sensing on board, so you understand when you\u2019re in contact.\n\nInternally, the most contentious aspect of the design may well be the head. The big, round display has shades of a cosmetic mirror.\n\n\u201cIt was one of the design elements we fretted over quite a bit,\u201d says Playter. \u201cEverybody else had a sort of humanoid shape. I wanted it to be different. We want it to be friendly and open. It provides a palette for a display. Of course, there are sensors buried in there, but also the shape is really intended to indicate some friendliness. That will be important for interacting with these things in the future.\u201d\n\nAn Atlas for Christmas\n\nThe landscape has changed dramatically in the decade since the hydraulic Atlas\u2019 introduction. Electric Atlas has a fair bit of company, in the form of humanoid robots from Figure, Apptronik, Tesla and 1X, among others.\n\n\u201cFor us, there\u2019s obviously been a huge influx of interest. I think that influx has been motivated by three events. Boston Dynamics got acquired [by Hyundai] for nearly a billion dollars. That sort of woke everybody up like, \u2018whoa, there\u2019s an exit path.\u2019 Tesla expressing interest in manufacturing sort of validated things we\u2019ve been doing for a long time. And then, the emergence of AI as a tool to help deal with generality is making all of this feasible. We\u2019ve been patient to announce, because we wanted to do enough research to understand that we can solve manipulation problems and be confident in a new generation of machine.\n\nIn spite of Boston Dynamics\u2019 big head start in humanoids, Playter says the company got the new robot\u2019s first build together around Christmas 2023. Before that, it was working through many of the more complex problems in simulation.\n\nThis week, it seems, the company is finally ready to begin showing off what the robot can do \u2014 or at least the early stages of what it\u2019s planning with the system.\n\nGeneral intelligence\n\nOne thing you can definitely say about Elon Musk is the guy makes big promises. In the earliest public-facing days of Optimus, when the Tesla \u2019bot appeared to be little more than a spandex-clad human, the executive spoke of a system that could do it all. Your Optimus could work all day in the factory, do your grocery shopping and then cook you dinner. That\u2019s the dream, right?\n\nThe truth of the matter is, of course, one built around baby steps. Robotics firms may already be discussing \u201cgeneral-purpose humanoids,\u201d but their systems are scaling one task at a time. For most, that means moving payloads from point A to B. Truly utilizing the form factor, however, will require a more generalized intelligence.\n\nIt appears the app store model might present the clearest path there. Developer access has, after all, been a big part of growing out Spot\u2019s feature set. Playter, however, says Boston Dynamics won\u2019t be taking that approach with Atlas.\n\n\u201cWe are definitely going to target an application ourself and not build a platform,\u201d he says. Our experience is that the way to go fast is for us to focus on an application and go solve problems \u2014 and not assume someone else is going to solve it for us. I do think AI is an essential piece here. To support the generality of tasks is going to take and will be reinforced with AI techniques.\u201d\n\nThe company recently opened access to Spot\u2019s reinforcement learning algorithm for developers. That work will be foundational to Atlas\u2019 growing skillset.\n\nOutside the box\n\nTo be successful, Playter explains, humanoids have to move beyond the boxes.\n\n\u201cI think you can do that with so many other robots,\u201d he says. \u201cHumanoids need to be able to support a huge generality of tasks. You\u2019ve got two hands. You want to be able to pick up complex, heavy geometric shapes that a simple box picker could not pick up \u2014 and you\u2019ve got to do hundreds of thousands of those. I think the single-task robot is a thing of the past. Stretch is one of the last applications where you can have a robot just moving around boxes and make it work.\u201d\n\nIf not boxes, what will the new Atlas be tasked with on the Hyundai show floor? The answer can be found in a video posted by the company back in February, which saw the hydraulic version of the robot interacting with car struts \u2014 the Hyundai components to which Playter alluded to earlier.\n\n\u201cOur long history in dynamic mobility means we\u2019re strong and we know how to accommodate a heavy payload and still maintain tremendous mobility,\u201d he says. \u201cI think that\u2019s going to be a differentiator for us, being able to pick up heavy, complex, massive things. That strut in the video probably weighs 25 pounds. Picking up wheels \u2014 we\u2019ll launch a video later as part of this whole effort showing a little bit more of the manipulation tasks with real-world objects we\u2019ve been doing with Atlas. I\u2019m confident we know how to do that part, and I haven\u2019t seen others doing that yet.\u201d", "authors": "['Brian Heater']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DSC07581243.jpg?resize=1200,800", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "A humanoid robot is on its way from Mobileye founder", "text": "Mentee Robotics hasn\u2019t been in stealth, exactly. The Israeli firm caught a small wave of press at the tail end of 2022, following Tesla\u2019s initial humanoid robotics announcement. As that was the year of the startup\u2019s founding, it didn\u2019t have much to show off at the time. Even so, the firm caught some headlines because its co-founder and chair, Amnon Shashua, founded Mobileye and the well-funded AI firm, AI21 Labs.\n\nOn Wednesday, however, the company offered up a glimpse of Menteebot, its own stab at the rapidly growing humanoid category. In its current form, the system certainly represents a dramatically different approach than others on the market. In fact, this is one of those spots where the precise definition of what constitutes a humanoid system gets blurred.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting here that the robot on display is very much a prototype \u2014 albeit one its creators believe has made sufficient progress to justify a public debut after two years in stealth. Given Shashua\u2019s resume, two things are predictably front and center with Menteebot: computer vision and generative AI.\n\n\u201cWe are on the cusp of a convergence of computer vision, natural language understanding, strong and detailed simulators, and methodologies on and for transferring from simulation to the real world,\u201d the founder says in a release. \u201cAt Mentee Robotics we see this convergence as the starting point for designing the future general-purpose bi-pedal robot that can move everywhere (as a human) with the brains to perform household tasks and learn through imitation tasks it was not previously trained for.\u201d\n\nUndoubtedly, perception and reasoning are two key pillars that are going to drive the evolution of the category, and Mentee has a lot going for it, with regard to pedigree. In addition to Shashua, the founding team is rounded out by CEO and former Facebook AI Research director Lior Wolf and Shai Shalev-Shwartz, a professor at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel and current Mobileye CTO. That team, in part, has helped the firm raise $17 million, thus far, led by Ahren Innovation Capital.\n\nMentee looks to be casting a very wide net to start, looking at both the industrial and home markets. Makers of humanoids will generally tell you that the home is somewhere way down the road map. Warehouse and factories are the first stop, given the need for additional labor, and the fact that they\u2019ve got deeper pockets than most consumers and the more structured environments offered by industrial settings.\n\nFor now, the company is showcasing how AI models can help the system work through tasks.\n\nMentee notes:\n\nTransformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) are used for interpreting commands and \u201cthinking through\u201d the required steps for completing the task. An emphasis is placed on the ability to integrate locomotion and dexterity, i.e., dynamically balancing the robot when carrying weights or reaching out with the hands.\n\nMentee expects to release a production-ready prototype toward the beginning of 2025.", "authors": "['Brian Heater']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_0955.jpeg?w=885", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "A humanoid robot is on its way from Mobileye founder", "text": "Mentee Robotics hasn\u2019t been in stealth, exactly. The Israeli firm caught a small wave of press at the tail end of 2022, following Tesla\u2019s initial humanoid robotics announcement. As that was the year of the startup\u2019s founding, it didn\u2019t have much to show off at the time. Even so, the firm caught some headlines because its co-founder and chair, Amnon Shashua, founded Mobileye and the well-funded AI firm, AI21 Labs.\n\nOn Wednesday, however, the company offered up a glimpse of Menteebot, its own stab at the rapidly growing humanoid category. In its current form, the system certainly represents a dramatically different approach than others on the market. In fact, this is one of those spots where the precise definition of what constitutes a humanoid system gets blurred.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting here that the robot on display is very much a prototype \u2014 albeit one its creators believe has made sufficient progress to justify a public debut after two years in stealth. Given Shashua\u2019s resume, two things are predictably front and center with Menteebot: computer vision and generative AI.\n\n\u201cWe are on the cusp of a convergence of computer vision, natural language understanding, strong and detailed simulators, and methodologies on and for transferring from simulation to the real world,\u201d the founder says in a release. \u201cAt Mentee Robotics we see this convergence as the starting point for designing the future general-purpose bi-pedal robot that can move everywhere (as a human) with the brains to perform household tasks and learn through imitation tasks it was not previously trained for.\u201d\n\nUndoubtedly, perception and reasoning are two key pillars that are going to drive the evolution of the category, and Mentee has a lot going for it, with regard to pedigree. In addition to Shashua, the founding team is rounded out by CEO and former Facebook AI Research director Lior Wolf and Shai Shalev-Shwartz, a professor at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel and current Mobileye CTO. That team, in part, has helped the firm raise $17 million, thus far, led by Ahren Innovation Capital.\n\nMentee looks to be casting a very wide net to start, looking at both the industrial and home markets. Makers of humanoids will generally tell you that the home is somewhere way down the road map. Warehouse and factories are the first stop, given the need for additional labor, and the fact that they\u2019ve got deeper pockets than most consumers and the more structured environments offered by industrial settings.\n\nFor now, the company is showcasing how AI models can help the system work through tasks.\n\nMentee notes:\n\nTransformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) are used for interpreting commands and \u201cthinking through\u201d the required steps for completing the task. An emphasis is placed on the ability to integrate locomotion and dexterity, i.e., dynamically balancing the robot when carrying weights or reaching out with the hands.\n\nMentee expects to release a production-ready prototype toward the beginning of 2025.", "authors": "['Brian Heater']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_0955.jpeg?w=885", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

The investor\u2019s latest \u201cCamp\u201d incubator trained up and funded nine AI agent startups they hope will take on today\u2019s more tedious tasks.\n\nThe use cases for many of these companies sound promising, but AI tends to have trouble keeping its promises. Would you trust a shiny new AI to sort your email for you? What about extracting and structuring information from a web page? Will anyone mind an AI slotting meetings in wherever works?\n\nThere\u2019s an element of trust that has yet to be established with these services, something that occurs with most technologies that change how we act. Asking MapQuest for directions felt weird until it didn\u2019t \u2014 and now GPS navigation is an everyday tool. But are AI agents at that stage? Betaworks CEO and founder John Borthwick thinks so.

And over time, through highly communicative interface design, the feedback loops from those customers created an even better, more reliable product,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor now, most of the early users of the products in Camp are developers and founders and early tech adopters, and that group has always been willing to patiently test and deliver feedback on these products, which eventually leap over to the mainstream.\u201d\n\nBetaworks Camp is a three-month accelerator in which selected companies in the chosen theme get hands-on help with their product, strategy and connections before getting shooed out the door with a $500,000 check \u2014 courtesy of Betaworks itself, Mozilla Ventures, Differential Ventures and Stem AI. But not before the startups strut their stuff on demo day, May 7.\n\nWe got a look at the lineup beforehand, though. Here are the three that stuck out to me the most.\n\nTwin automates tasks using an \u201caction model\u201d the likes of which we\u2019ve heard Rabbit talk about for a few months now (but have not yet shipped). By training a model on lots of data representing software interfaces, it can (these companies claim) learn how to complete common tasks, things that are more complex than an API can handle, yet not so much that they can\u2019t be delegated to a \u201csmart intern.\u201d We actually wrote them up back in January.\n\nSo instead of having a back-end engineer build a custom script to do a certain task, you can demonstrate or describe it in ordinary language. Stuff like \u201cput all the resum\u00e9s we got today in a folder in Dropbox and rename them after the applicant, then DM me the share link in Slack.\u201d And once you\u2019ve tweaked that workflow (\u201cOops, this time add the application date to the file names\u201d) it can just be the new way that process works. Automating the 20% of tasks that take up 80% of our time is the company\u2019s goal \u2014 whether it can do so affordably is probably the real question. (Twin declined to elaborate on the nature of their model and training process.)\n\nSkej aims to ameliorate the occasionally painful process of finding a meeting time that works for two (or three, or four\u2026) people. You just cc the bot on an email or Slack thread and it\u2019ll start the process of reconciling everyone\u2019s availability and preferences. If it has access to schedules, it\u2019ll check those; if someone says they\u2019d prefer the afternoon if it\u2019s on Thursday, it works with that; you can say some people get priority; and so on. Anyone who works with a skilled executive assistant knows they are irreplaceable, but chances are every EA out there would rather spend less time on tasks that are just a bunch of \u201cHow about this? No? How about this?\u201d\n\nAs a misanthrope, I don\u2019t have this scheduling problem, but I appreciate that others do, and also would prefer a \u201cset it and forget it\u201d type solution where they just acquiesce with the results. And it\u2019s well within the capabilities of today\u2019s AI agents, which would primarily be tasked with understanding natural language rather than forms.\n\nJsonify is an evolution of website scrapers that can extract data from relatively unstructured contexts. This has been done for ages, but the engine extracting the info has never been all that smart. If it\u2019s a big, flat document they work fine \u2014 if it\u2019s in on-site tabs or some poorly coded visual list meant for humans to click around, they can fail.

Or, you know, do professional stuff.\n\nBut doesn\u2019t the imprecision inherent to LLMs make them a questionable tool for the job? \u201cWe\u2019ve managed to build a pretty robust guardrail and cross-checking system,\u201d said founder Paul Hunkin. \u201cWe use a few different models at runtime for understanding the page, which provide some validation \u2014 and the LLMs we use are fine-tuned to our use case, so they\u2019re usually pretty reliable even without the guardrail layer.

Clearly Betaworks aims to get their foot in the door early even if some of the products aren\u2019t quite ready for their mass market debut just yet.\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to see the companies show off their agentic wares on May 7.\n\nCorrection: This story was updated to reflect that the founder of Jsonify is Paul Hunkin, not Ananth Manivannan.", "authors": "['Devin Coldewey']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1175378338-e1690490857222.jpg?w=1200", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "Amazon Music follows Spotify with an AI playlist generator of its own, Maestro", "text": "Spotify isn\u2019t the only company to dabble with using AI to generate playlists \u2014 on Tuesday, Amazon said it would do the same. Amazon Music is now testing Maestro, an AI playlist generator, allowing U.S. customers on both iOS and Android to create playlists using spoken or written prompts \u2014 which can even contain emojis.\n\nAmazon suggests that in addition to emojis, users can write prompts that include activities, sounds or emotions. They can also choose from prompt suggestions at the bottom of the screen if they don\u2019t know what to write. Seconds later, an AI-generated playlist will appear with songs that will \u2014 in theory \u2014 match your input.\n\nThe product is launching in beta, so Amazon warns that the technology behind Maestro \u201cwon\u2019t always get it right the first time.\u201d Like Spotify, Amazon has also added some guardrails to the experience to proactively block offensive language and other inappropriate prompts, it says. (We\u2019re guessing people will try to break through those barriers in time!)\n\nMaestro is not yet widely available. While Spotify\u2019s AI generator is starting its tests in the U.K. and Australia, Amazon\u2019s product is launching to a \u201csubset\u201d of free Amazon Music users, as well as Prime customers and Unlimited Amazon Music subscribers, on iOS and Android in the U.S. for the time being.\n\nSubscribers will gain access to more functionality, however. For instance, they\u2019ll be able to listen to playlists instantly and save them for later, but Prime members and ad-supported users will only be able to listen to 30-second previews of the songs before saving them. This could potentially push more users to upgrade to the paid subscription if they like the AI functionality. The move also follows the general trend of making premium AI experiences a paid offering.\n\nTo access Maestro, users will need the latest version of the Amazon Music mobile app. They will have to tap on the option for Maestro on their home screen. They may also see the option to use Maestro when they tap on the plus sign to create a new playlist. From there, users can either talk or write out their playlist prompt idea, then tap \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d to start streaming it. The playlist can also be saved and shared with friends.\n\nAmazon suggests prompts like \u201c\ud83d\ude2d and eating \ud83c\udf5d\u201d; \u201cMake my \ud83d\udc76 a genius\u201d; \u201cMyspace era hip-hop\u201d; \u201c\ud83c\udfdc\ufe0f\ud83c\udf35\ud83e\udd20;\u201d \u201cMusic my grandparents made out to\u201d; \u201c\ud83c\udfa4\ud83d\udebf\ud83e\uddfc\u201d; and \u201cI tracked my friends and they\u2019re all hanging out without me\u201d to give you an idea of how silly the prompts can be for this new experience.\n\nThe company didn\u2019t say when the beta would roll out more broadly, only that it would expand to more customers over time.", "authors": "['Sarah Perez']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/amazon-music-maestro.jpeg?resize=1200,676", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "Amazon Music follows Spotify with an AI playlist generator of its own, Maestro", "text": "Spotify isn\u2019t the only company to dabble with using AI to generate playlists \u2014 on Tuesday, Amazon said it would do the same. Amazon Music is now testing Maestro, an AI playlist generator, allowing U.S. customers on both iOS and Android to create playlists using spoken or written prompts \u2014 which can even contain emojis.\n\nAmazon suggests that in addition to emojis, users can write prompts that include activities, sounds or emotions. They can also choose from prompt suggestions at the bottom of the screen if they don\u2019t know what to write. Seconds later, an AI-generated playlist will appear with songs that will \u2014 in theory \u2014 match your input.\n\nThe product is launching in beta, so Amazon warns that the technology behind Maestro \u201cwon\u2019t always get it right the first time.\u201d Like Spotify, Amazon has also added some guardrails to the experience to proactively block offensive language and other inappropriate prompts, it says. (We\u2019re guessing people will try to break through those barriers in time!)\n\nMaestro is not yet widely available. While Spotify\u2019s AI generator is starting its tests in the U.K. and Australia, Amazon\u2019s product is launching to a \u201csubset\u201d of free Amazon Music users, as well as Prime customers and Unlimited Amazon Music subscribers, on iOS and Android in the U.S. for the time being.\n\nSubscribers will gain access to more functionality, however. For instance, they\u2019ll be able to listen to playlists instantly and save them for later, but Prime members and ad-supported users will only be able to listen to 30-second previews of the songs before saving them. This could potentially push more users to upgrade to the paid subscription if they like the AI functionality. The move also follows the general trend of making premium AI experiences a paid offering.\n\nTo access Maestro, users will need the latest version of the Amazon Music mobile app. They will have to tap on the option for Maestro on their home screen. They may also see the option to use Maestro when they tap on the plus sign to create a new playlist. From there, users can either talk or write out their playlist prompt idea, then tap \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d to start streaming it. The playlist can also be saved and shared with friends.\n\nAmazon suggests prompts like \u201c\ud83d\ude2d and eating \ud83c\udf5d\u201d; \u201cMake my \ud83d\udc76 a genius\u201d; \u201cMyspace era hip-hop\u201d; \u201c\ud83c\udfdc\ufe0f\ud83c\udf35\ud83e\udd20;\u201d \u201cMusic my grandparents made out to\u201d; \u201c\ud83c\udfa4\ud83d\udebf\ud83e\uddfc\u201d; and \u201cI tracked my friends and they\u2019re all hanging out without me\u201d to give you an idea of how silly the prompts can be for this new experience.\n\nThe company didn\u2019t say when the beta would roll out more broadly, only that it would expand to more customers over time.", "authors": "['Sarah Perez']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/amazon-music-maestro.jpeg?resize=1200,676", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

After considering a few ideas, they decided to go after what they saw as a largely unaddressed market: Tools to help small businesses secure U.S. government contracts.\n\n\u201cThe federal contracting community has seen a shrinking of the small business industrial base for much of the past decade,\u201d Doherty told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for these companies to compete against giants like Lockheed Martin or Northrop Grumman. It\u2019s also expensive for them to bid on contracts \u2014 if they don\u2019t win, they may run out of cash.\u201d\n\nAs a result of labyrinthine systems and mountains of paperwork, finding and bidding for U.S. federal contracts is a laborious process. It takes weeks at a minimum to complete, according to Doherty \u2014 and often the best-resourced companies are the most successful.\n\nIn a 2023 survey from Setscale, a purchase order financing startup, small business owners cited insufficient cash flow and working capital \u2014 and a lack of time and resources \u2014 as their top roadblocks to securing government contracts.\n\nTo attempt to give these small businesses a boost, Goltser, Mason and Doherty founded GovDash, a platform that provides workflows to support government contract capture, proposal, development and management processes. GovDash was accepted to Y Combinator in 2022; Goltser dropped out of college to help spearhead it.\n\nGovDash is essentially a contract proposal generator.

It\u2019s a well-established fact. So why should businesses expect GovDash to be any different?\n\nTwo reasons, argues Doherty.\n\nOne, GovDash built a system that cross-checks businesses\u2019 info to see just how relevant the business is to a given federal contract. If the relevancy \u2014 as judged by the system \u2014 isn\u2019t obvious, GovDash prompts the business to template out sections of the contract proposal with more information.\n\nTwo, GovDash involves heavy human review. At each stage of the proposal-generating process, the platform checks in with a human reviewer to get their seal of approval.\n\nThese steps \u2014 cross-checking and human review \u2014 aren\u2019t infallible, Doherty admits. But he claims they\u2019re better than what a lot of the competition\u2019s doing.\n\n\u201cCompanies now have one place where their business development data flows seamlessly, with an AI agent at its core to automate tedious workflows,\u201d Doherty said. \u201cThis is a huge win for the C-suite as they can get out more proposals, at a higher-quality level, in a fraction of the time, and put all the associated workflows on autopilot.\u201d\n\nGovDash\u2019s competition is growing \u2014 and quickly.\n\nGovDash competes with Govly, whose platform lets companies assess, search and analyze government contracting requirements across disparate sources.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/16/metas-oversight-board-probes-explicit-ai-generated-images-posted-on-instagram-and-facebook/
{"title": "Meta\u2019s Oversight Board probes explicit AI-generated images posted on Instagram and Facebook", "text": "The Oversight Board, Meta\u2019s semi-independent policy council, is turning its attention to how the company\u2019s social platforms are handling explicit, AI-generated images. Tuesday, it announced investigations into two separate cases over how Instagram in India and Facebook in the U.S. handled AI-generated images of public figures after Meta\u2019s systems fell short on detecting and responding to the explicit content.\n\nIn both cases, the sites have now taken down the media. The board is not naming the individuals targeted by the AI images \u201cto avoid gender-based harassment,\u201d according to an e-mail Meta sent to TechCrunch.\n\nThe board takes up cases about Meta\u2019s moderation decisions. Users have to appeal to Meta first about a moderation move before approaching the Oversight Board. The board is due to publish its full findings and conclusions in the future.\n\nThe cases\n\nDescribing the first case, the board said that a user reported as pornography an AI-generated nude of a public figure from India on Instagram. The image was posted by an account that exclusively posts images of Indian women created by AI, and the majority of users who react to these images are based in India.\n\nMeta failed to take down the image after the first report, and the ticket for the report was closed automatically after 48 hours after the company didn\u2019t review the report further. When the original complainant appealed the decision, the report was again closed automatically without any oversight from Meta. In other words, after two reports, the explicit AI-generated image remained on Instagram.\n\nThe user then finally appealed to the board. The company only acted at that point to remove the objectionable content and removed the image for breaching its community standards on bullying and harassment.\n\nThe second case relates to Facebook, where a user posted an explicit, AI-generated image that resembled a U.S. public figure in a group focusing on AI creations. In this case, the social network took down the image as it was posted by another user earlier, and Meta had added it to a Media Matching Service Bank under \u201cderogatory sexualized photoshop or drawings\u201d category.\n\nWhen TechCrunch asked why the board selected a case where the company successfully took down an explicit AI-generated image, the board said it selects cases \u201cthat are emblematic of broader issues across Meta\u2019s platforms.\u201d It added that these cases help the advisory board to look at the global effectiveness of Meta\u2019s policy and processes for various topics.\n\n\u201cWe know that Meta is quicker and more effective at moderating content in some markets and languages than others. By taking one case from the US and one from India, we want to look at whether Meta is protecting all women globally in a fair way,\u201d Oversight Board co-chair Helle Thorning-Schmidt said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe Board believes it\u2019s important to explore whether Meta\u2019s policies and enforcement practices are effective at addressing this problem.\u201d\n\nThe problem of deepfake porn and online gender-based violence\n\nSome \u2014 not all \u2014 generative AI tools in recent years have expanded to allow users to generate porn. As TechCrunch reported previously, groups like Unstable Diffusion are trying to monetize AI porn with murky ethical lines and bias in data.\n\nIn regions like India, deepfakes have also become an issue of concern. Last year, a report from the BBC noted that the number of deepfaked videos of Indian actresses has soared in recent times. Data suggests that women are more commonly subjects for deepfaked videos.\n\nEarlier this year, Deputy IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar expressed dissatisfaction with tech companies\u2019 approach to countering deepfakes.\n\n\u201cIf a platform thinks that they can get away without taking down deepfake videos, or merely maintain a casual approach to it, we have the power to protect our citizens by blocking such platforms,\u201d Chandrasekhar said in a press conference at that time.\n\nWhile India has mulled bringing specific deepfake-related rules into the law, nothing is set in stone yet.\n\nWhile the country has provisions for reporting online gender-based violence under law, experts note that the process could be tedious, and there is often little support. In a study published last year, the Indian advocacy group IT for Change noted that courts in India need to have robust processes to address online gender-based violence and not trivialize these cases.\n\nAparajita Bharti, co-founder at The Quantum Hub, an India-based public policy consulting firm, said that there should be limits on AI models to stop them from creating explicit content that causes harm.\n\n\u201cGenerative AI\u2019s main risk is that the volume of such content would increase because it is easy to generate such content and with a high degree of sophistication. Therefore, we need to first prevent the creation of such content by training AI models to limit output in case the intention to harm someone is already clear. We should also introduce default labeling for easy detection as well,\u201d Bharti told TechCrunch over an email.\n\nDevika Malik, a platform policy expert who previously worked in Meta\u2019s South Asia policy team, said that while social networks have policies against non-consensual intimate imagery, enforcement is largely reliant on user reporting.\n\n\u201cThis places an unfair onus on the affected user to prove their identity and the lack of consent (as is the case with Meta\u2019s policy). This can get more error-prone when it comes to synthetic media, and to say, the time taken to capture and verify these external signals enables the content to gain harmful traction,\u201d Malik said.\n\nThere are currently only a few laws globally that address the production and distribution of porn generated using AI tools. A handful of U.S. states have laws against deepfakes. The U.K. introduced a law this week to criminalize the creation of sexually explicit AI-powered imagery.\n\nMeta\u2019s response and the next steps\n\nIn response to the Oversight Board\u2019s cases, Meta said it took down both pieces of content. However, the social media company didn\u2019t address the fact that it failed to remove content on Instagram after initial reports by users or for how long the content was up on the platform.\n\nMeta said that it uses a mix of artificial intelligence and human review to detect sexually suggestive content. The social media giant said that it doesn\u2019t recommend this kind of content in places like Instagram Explore or Reels recommendations.\n\nThe Oversight Board has sought public comments \u2014 with a deadline of April 30 \u2014 on the matter that addresses harms by deepfake porn, contextual information about the proliferation of such content in regions like the U.S. and India, and possible pitfalls of Meta\u2019s approach in detecting AI-generated explicit imagery.\n\nThe board will investigate the cases and public comments and post the decision on the site in a few weeks.\n\nThese cases indicate that large platforms are still grappling with older moderation processes while AI-powered tools have enabled users to create and distribute different types of content quickly and easily.

{"title": "Meta\u2019s Oversight Board probes explicit AI-generated images posted on Instagram and Facebook", "text": "The Oversight Board, Meta\u2019s semi-independent policy council, is turning its attention to how the company\u2019s social platforms are handling explicit, AI-generated images. Tuesday, it announced investigations into two separate cases over how Instagram in India and Facebook in the U.S. handled AI-generated images of public figures after Meta\u2019s systems fell short on detecting and responding to the explicit content.\n\nIn both cases, the sites have now taken down the media. The board is not naming the individuals targeted by the AI images \u201cto avoid gender-based harassment,\u201d according to an e-mail Meta sent to TechCrunch.\n\nThe board takes up cases about Meta\u2019s moderation decisions. Users have to appeal to Meta first about a moderation move before approaching the Oversight Board. The board is due to publish its full findings and conclusions in the future.\n\nThe cases\n\nDescribing the first case, the board said that a user reported as pornography an AI-generated nude of a public figure from India on Instagram. The image was posted by an account that exclusively posts images of Indian women created by AI, and the majority of users who react to these images are based in India.\n\nMeta failed to take down the image after the first report, and the ticket for the report was closed automatically after 48 hours after the company didn\u2019t review the report further. When the original complainant appealed the decision, the report was again closed automatically without any oversight from Meta. In other words, after two reports, the explicit AI-generated image remained on Instagram.\n\nThe user then finally appealed to the board. The company only acted at that point to remove the objectionable content and removed the image for breaching its community standards on bullying and harassment.\n\nThe second case relates to Facebook, where a user posted an explicit, AI-generated image that resembled a U.S. public figure in a group focusing on AI creations. In this case, the social network took down the image as it was posted by another user earlier, and Meta had added it to a Media Matching Service Bank under \u201cderogatory sexualized photoshop or drawings\u201d category.\n\nWhen TechCrunch asked why the board selected a case where the company successfully took down an explicit AI-generated image, the board said it selects cases \u201cthat are emblematic of broader issues across Meta\u2019s platforms.\u201d It added that these cases help the advisory board to look at the global effectiveness of Meta\u2019s policy and processes for various topics.\n\n\u201cWe know that Meta is quicker and more effective at moderating content in some markets and languages than others. By taking one case from the US and one from India, we want to look at whether Meta is protecting all women globally in a fair way,\u201d Oversight Board co-chair Helle Thorning-Schmidt said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe Board believes it\u2019s important to explore whether Meta\u2019s policies and enforcement practices are effective at addressing this problem.\u201d\n\nThe problem of deepfake porn and online gender-based violence\n\nSome \u2014 not all \u2014 generative AI tools in recent years have expanded to allow users to generate porn. As TechCrunch reported previously, groups like Unstable Diffusion are trying to monetize AI porn with murky ethical lines and bias in data.\n\nIn regions like India, deepfakes have also become an issue of concern. Last year, a report from the BBC noted that the number of deepfaked videos of Indian actresses has soared in recent times. Data suggests that women are more commonly subjects for deepfaked videos.\n\nEarlier this year, Deputy IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar expressed dissatisfaction with tech companies\u2019 approach to countering deepfakes.\n\n\u201cIf a platform thinks that they can get away without taking down deepfake videos, or merely maintain a casual approach to it, we have the power to protect our citizens by blocking such platforms,\u201d Chandrasekhar said in a press conference at that time.\n\nWhile India has mulled bringing specific deepfake-related rules into the law, nothing is set in stone yet.\n\nWhile the country has provisions for reporting online gender-based violence under law, experts note that the process could be tedious, and there is often little support. In a study published last year, the Indian advocacy group IT for Change noted that courts in India need to have robust processes to address online gender-based violence and not trivialize these cases.\n\nAparajita Bharti, co-founder at The Quantum Hub, an India-based public policy consulting firm, said that there should be limits on AI models to stop them from creating explicit content that causes harm.\n\n\u201cGenerative AI\u2019s main risk is that the volume of such content would increase because it is easy to generate such content and with a high degree of sophistication. Therefore, we need to first prevent the creation of such content by training AI models to limit output in case the intention to harm someone is already clear. We should also introduce default labeling for easy detection as well,\u201d Bharti told TechCrunch over an email.\n\nDevika Malik, a platform policy expert who previously worked in Meta\u2019s South Asia policy team, said that while social networks have policies against non-consensual intimate imagery, enforcement is largely reliant on user reporting.\n\n\u201cThis places an unfair onus on the affected user to prove their identity and the lack of consent (as is the case with Meta\u2019s policy). This can get more error-prone when it comes to synthetic media, and to say, the time taken to capture and verify these external signals enables the content to gain harmful traction,\u201d Malik said.\n\nThere are currently only a few laws globally that address the production and distribution of porn generated using AI tools. A handful of U.S. states have laws against deepfakes. The U.K. introduced a law this week to criminalize the creation of sexually explicit AI-powered imagery.\n\nMeta\u2019s response and the next steps\n\nIn response to the Oversight Board\u2019s cases, Meta said it took down both pieces of content. However, the social media company didn\u2019t address the fact that it failed to remove content on Instagram after initial reports by users or for how long the content was up on the platform.\n\nMeta said that it uses a mix of artificial intelligence and human review to detect sexually suggestive content. The social media giant said that it doesn\u2019t recommend this kind of content in places like Instagram Explore or Reels recommendations.\n\nThe Oversight Board has sought public comments \u2014 with a deadline of April 30 \u2014 on the matter that addresses harms by deepfake porn, contextual information about the proliferation of such content in regions like the U.S. and India, and possible pitfalls of Meta\u2019s approach in detecting AI-generated explicit imagery.\n\nThe board will investigate the cases and public comments and post the decision on the site in a few weeks.\n\nThese cases indicate that large platforms are still grappling with older moderation processes while AI-powered tools have enabled users to create and distribute different types of content quickly and easily. Companies like Meta are experimenting with tools that use AI for content generation, with some efforts to detect such imagery. In April, the company announced that it would apply \u201cMade with AI\u201d badges to deepfakes if it could detect the content using \u201cindustry standard AI image indicators\u201d or user disclosures.\n\nPlatform policy expert Malik said that labeling is often inefficient because the system to detect AI-generated imagery is still not reliable.\n\n\u201cLabelling has been shown to have limited impact when it comes to limiting the distribution of harmful content. If we think back to the case of AI-generated images of Taylor Swift, millions of users were directed to those images through X\u2019s own trending topic \u2018Taylor Swift AI.\u2019 So, people and the platform knew that the content was not authentic, and it was still algorithmically amplified,\u201d Malik noted.\n\nHowever, perpetrators are constantly finding ways to evade these detection systems and post problematic content on social platforms.\n\nYou can reach out to Ivan Mehta at im@ivanmehta.com by email and through this link on Signal.", "authors": "['Ivan Mehta']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dripping-meta-logo.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "Cape dials up $61M from a16z and more for mobile service that doesn\u2019t use personal data", "text": "AT&T\u2019s recent mega customer data breach \u2014 74 million accounts affected \u2014 laid bare how much data carriers have on their users, and also that the data is there for the hacking. On Thursday, a startup called Cape \u2014 based out of Washington, D.C., and founded by a former executive from Palantir \u2014 is announcing $61 million in funding to build what it claims will be a much more secure approach: It won\u2019t be able to leak your name, address, Social Security number or location because it never asks for these in the first place.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t leak or sell what you don\u2019t have,\u201d according to the company\u2019s website. \u201cWe ask for the minimal amount of personal information and store sensitive credentials locally on your device, not on our network. That\u2019s privacy by design.\u201d\n\nThe funding is notable in part because Cape\u2019s appeal to users is not yet proven. The company only came out of stealth four months ago, and it has yet to launch a commercial service for consumers. That\u2019s due to come in June, CEO and founder John Doyle said in an interview. It has one pilot project in operation, deploying some of its tech with the U.S. government, securing communications on Guam.\n\nThe $61 million it announced Thursday is an aggregation across three rounds: a seed and Series A of $21 million (raised when it was still in stealth mode as a company called Private Tech) and a Series B of $40 million. The latest round is being co-led by A-Star and a16z, with XYZ Ventures, ex/ante, Costanoa Ventures, Point72 Ventures, Forward Deployed VC and Karman Ventures also participating. Cape is not disclosing its valuation.\n\nDoyle attracted that investor attention in part because his past roles have included nearly nine years of working for Palantir as the head of its national security business. Prior to that, he was a special forces sergeant in the U.S. Army.\n\nThose jobs exposed him to users (like government departments) who treated the security of personal information and privacy around data usage as essential. But, more entrepreneurially, they also got him thinking about consumers.\n\nWith the big focus that data privacy and security have today in the public consciousness \u2014 typically because of the many bad-news stories we hear about data breaches, the encroaching activities of social networks and many questions about national security and digital networks \u2014 there is a clear opportunity to build tools like these for ordinary people, too, even if it feels like that might be impossible these days.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually one of the reasons I started the company,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cIt feels like the problem is too big, right? It feels like our data is already out there and all these different ways and there\u2019s really nothing to be done about it. We\u2019ve all adopted a learned helplessness around the ability to be connected, but have some sort of private, some sort of control over our own data, but that\u2019s not necessarily true.\u201d\n\nCape\u2019s first efforts will be focused on providing eSIMs to users, which Doyle said would be sold essentially on a prepaid format to avoid the data that a contract might entail. Cape on Thursday also announced a partnership with UScellular, which itself provides an MNVO covering 12 cellular networks; Doyle said that Cape is talking with other telcos, too. Initially, it\u2019s unlikely to bundle that eSIM with any mobile devices, although that also is not off the table for the future, Doyle said. Nor will the company provide encryption services around apps, voice calls and mobile data, at least not initially.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not focused on securing the content of communications. There\u2019s a whole host of app-based solutions out there, apps out there like Proton Mail and Signal, and WhatsApp and other encrypted messaging platforms that do a good job, to varying degrees, depending on who you trust for securing the contents of your communications,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are focused on your location and your identity data, in particular, as it relates to connecting to commercial cellular infrastructure, which is a related but separate set of problems.\u201d\n\nCape\u2019s not the only company in the market that is trying (or has tried, past-tense) to address privacy in the mobile sphere, but none of them has really made a mark so far. In Europe, recent efforts include the MVNO Murena, the OS maker Jolla and the hardware company Punkt. Those that have come and gone include the Privacy Phone (FreedomPop) and Blackphone (from GeeksPhone and Silent Circle).\n\nThere\u2019s already the option to buy a prepaid SIM in the U.S. anonymously, but Cape points out that this has other trade-offs and isn\u2019t as secure as what Cape is building. Although payments for this might be anonymous, a user\u2019s data is still routed through the network infrastructure of the underlying carrier, making a user\u2019s movements and usage observable. You can also still be open to SIM swap attacks and spam.\n\nFor a16z, the investment is becoming a part of the firm\u2019s \u201cAmerican Dynamism\u201d effort, which this week got a $600 million boost from the latest $7.2 billion in funds that the VC raised.\n\n\u201cCape\u2019s technology is an answer to long-standing, critical vulnerabilities in today\u2019s telecom infrastructure that impacts everything from homeland security to consumer privacy,\u201d said Katherine Boyle, general partner at a16z, in a statement. \u201cThe team is the first to apply this caliber of R&D muscle to rethinking legacy telecom networks, and are well placed to reshape the way mobile carriers think about their subscribers \u2014 as customers instead of products.\u201d", "authors": "['Ingrid Lunden']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1371533646.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "Uber, Nvidia-backed Serve Robotics hits public markets with $40M splash", "text": "Serve Robotics, the Uber and Nvidia-backed sidewalk robot delivery company, debuted publicly on the stock exchange Thursday, making it the latest startup to choose going public via a reverse merger as an alternative path to capital needed to fund growth.\n\nThe company, which spun out of Uber\u2019s acquisition of Postmates in 2021, hits the Nasdaq under the ticker \u201cSERV\u201d with gross proceeds of roughly $40 million \u2014 \u201cprior to deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses,\u201d per regulatory filings \u2014 at a share price of $4.\n\nServe completed its reverse merger with blank-check company Patricia Acquisition Corp. in August 2023, and at the same time secured $30 million in a round led by existing investors Uber, Nvidia and Wavemaker Partners, bringing its total amount raised at the time to $56 million. While Serve\u2019s debut in the public markets comes from a reverse merger and not a SPAC, the two alternate paths to IPO are not too dissimilar.

That\u2019s at a loss of $1.5 million in 2023 and $1.04 million in 2022. However, Serve Robotics said it\u2019s expecting enormous growth fueled by money generated by going public. Those funds will go toward funding R&D for future generations of robots, manufacturing activities, geographic expansion and general working capital and corporate purposes.\n\nThe startup also has some big revenue ambitions. Serve said it aims to generate between $60 million and $80 million in annual revenue, with contribution margins of over 50% and positive cash flow by the end of 2025. The company pointed to recent momentum, including its 25% month-over-month increase in deliveries since 2022 when the startup started delivering for Uber Eats.\n\nFuture growth will come from scaling the 100 robots deployed today in Los Angeles to up to 2,000 robots in multiple U.S. cities by the end of next year through a contract with Uber Eats.

So there\u2019s a lot of regulatory momentum, but you also have the fact that there is a shortage of labor.

{"title": "Magnus Metal wants to revamp the 4,000-year-old way metal parts are made", "text": "Humans have cast metal parts in basically the same way for thousands of years: by pouring molten metal into a mold, often made of compacted sand and clay.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason this ancient method is used today: Sand casting is inexpensive and works well with both ferrous, or iron-based, and nonferrous metals. But there is a wasteful downside. The technique requires more metal than the finished part needs, and while scraps are usually recycled, melting excess metal over and over wastes energy. 3D printing has emerged as a pricey alternative generally reserved for prototypes and low-volume parts.\n\nOne startup, Magnus Metal, is working on a metal casting technology it claims is as fast and energy efficient as 3D printing at a cost that can compete with sand casting.\n\n\u201cOver time, as our reliability and utilization of the machine will rise, I think we are going to be competitive for parts that are not very simple,\u201d Magnus Metal co-founder and CEO Boaz Vinogradov told TechCrunch.\n\nFor simple pieces, sand casting will still have the advantage, but for complex parts like gearboxes, Vinogradov is confident his company can compete on cost.\n\nTo make those parts, Magnus Metal borrows elements of sand casting and 3D printing to perform what it calls digital casting. Before casting work begins, the company\u2019s software slices a design into layers. The company then takes the negative of that shape and creates ceramic forms between four to 20 mm thick, which will hold the metal in place while it cools.\n\nIn the casting machine, metal is melted and dripped into the ceramic base. Once a layer is complete, more metal is added. Each subsequent layer melts the previous one, ensuring the layers are bonded while also allowing impurities to float to the top, Vinogradov said. The melting and mixing of the layers allows its parts to have fewer defect rates and are 10% to 20% stronger than traditionally cast parts, the company said.\n\nMagnus Metal plans to sell its machines to customers as well as the proprietary ceramic that\u2019s used to produce the bases. The goal, Vinogradov added, is to generate between $500,000 to $1 million of recurring revenue per machine.\n\n\u201cIf you sell only machines, you\u2019re going to be cyclical,\u201d he said. \u201cWe produce our own ceramics, because in order to create a layer, you need ceramics that can withstand the shock of molten metal several times.\u201d\n\nMagnus Metal\u2019s layer-by-layer technique is similar to 3D printing, but Vinogradov said that his company\u2019s approach is faster, which helps lower costs. Each ceramic base can be reused, too, though only for a finite number of parts. And unlike 3D printing, which usually requires specific feedstocks, Magnus Metal said its system can use customer-specified materials.\n\nThe method doesn\u2019t require expensive tooling to create the bases, unlike molds for sand casting, according to the Magnus Metal. This means customers can make parts more cost-effectively at lower volumes relative to traditional casting, the startup says.\n\nBuilding industrial machinery like this doesn\u2019t come cheap, which is why Magnus Metal has raised a $74 million Series B, TechCrunch has exclusively learned.

{"title": "Magnus Metal wants to revamp the 4,000-year-old way metal parts are made", "text": "Humans have cast metal parts in basically the same way for thousands of years: by pouring molten metal into a mold, often made of compacted sand and clay.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason this ancient method is used today: Sand casting is inexpensive and works well with both ferrous, or iron-based, and nonferrous metals. But there is a wasteful downside. The technique requires more metal than the finished part needs, and while scraps are usually recycled, melting excess metal over and over wastes energy. 3D printing has emerged as a pricey alternative generally reserved for prototypes and low-volume parts.\n\nOne startup, Magnus Metal, is working on a metal casting technology it claims is as fast and energy efficient as 3D printing at a cost that can compete with sand casting.\n\n\u201cOver time, as our reliability and utilization of the machine will rise, I think we are going to be competitive for parts that are not very simple,\u201d Magnus Metal co-founder and CEO Boaz Vinogradov told TechCrunch.\n\nFor simple pieces, sand casting will still have the advantage, but for complex parts like gearboxes, Vinogradov is confident his company can compete on cost.\n\nTo make those parts, Magnus Metal borrows elements of sand casting and 3D printing to perform what it calls digital casting. Before casting work begins, the company\u2019s software slices a design into layers. The company then takes the negative of that shape and creates ceramic forms between four to 20 mm thick, which will hold the metal in place while it cools.\n\nIn the casting machine, metal is melted and dripped into the ceramic base. Once a layer is complete, more metal is added. Each subsequent layer melts the previous one, ensuring the layers are bonded while also allowing impurities to float to the top, Vinogradov said. The melting and mixing of the layers allows its parts to have fewer defect rates and are 10% to 20% stronger than traditionally cast parts, the company said.\n\nMagnus Metal plans to sell its machines to customers as well as the proprietary ceramic that\u2019s used to produce the bases. The goal, Vinogradov added, is to generate between $500,000 to $1 million of recurring revenue per machine.\n\n\u201cIf you sell only machines, you\u2019re going to be cyclical,\u201d he said. \u201cWe produce our own ceramics, because in order to create a layer, you need ceramics that can withstand the shock of molten metal several times.\u201d\n\nMagnus Metal\u2019s layer-by-layer technique is similar to 3D printing, but Vinogradov said that his company\u2019s approach is faster, which helps lower costs. Each ceramic base can be reused, too, though only for a finite number of parts. And unlike 3D printing, which usually requires specific feedstocks, Magnus Metal said its system can use customer-specified materials.\n\nThe method doesn\u2019t require expensive tooling to create the bases, unlike molds for sand casting, according to the Magnus Metal. This means customers can make parts more cost-effectively at lower volumes relative to traditional casting, the startup says.\n\nBuilding industrial machinery like this doesn\u2019t come cheap, which is why Magnus Metal has raised a $74 million Series B, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. The round was led by Entr\u00e9e Capital and Target Global with participation by Awz Ventures, Caterpillar Ventures, Cresson Management, Deep Insight Ventures, Discount Capital, Essentia Venture Capital, Lip Ventures, Lumir Ventures, Next Gear Fund and Tal Ventures.\n\n\u201cThis [round] is going to take us into industrialization this year and beta testing beginning of next year,\u201d Vinogradov. \u201cThe goal is to use this funding to have an industrial machine that is quite robust that the customers finished testing.\u201d", "authors": "['Tim De Chant']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1503285358.jpeg?resize=1200,832", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "Screen Skinz raises $1.5M seed to create custom screen protectors", "text": "Clay Canning had an idea while in high school: smartphone screen protectors that featured logos, right on the screen.\n\nHe later connected with Rashaun Brown, who was working in sports and licensing at the time, and the idea for Screen Skinz was born.\n\n\u201cWe both understood the opportunity and complemented each other\u2019s weakness,\u201d Brown, the company\u2019s CEO, told TechCrunch. \u201cIn December 2022, I resigned from my job to pursue building Screen Skinz with Clay full-time.\u201d\n\nNow, Screen Skinz can officially announce the closing of a $1.5 million seed round led by South Loop Ventures and Abo Ventures.\n\nThe company produces custom, patent-pending phone screen protectors that feature personalized logos or slogans that are visible when the phone screen is black and then disappear when the phone is in use. Customers can create their own designs or pick from the company\u2019s existing catalog.\n\nPhone accessories have always been a massive market, with the global screen protector market alone worth an estimated $51 billion as of 2023.\n\nScreen Skinz already holds creative licenses with various big-name brands, working with organizations such as the NFL and NBA and entertainment brands like Marvel and the WWE.\n\nThe latest fundraise allowed Screen Skinz to move manufacturing from Asia to the U.S., where it could more easily control its supply chain.\n\nThe company is looking to double down on the screen protection industry, and though it currently only focuses on smartphones, there is a plan to one day expand to making screen protectors for tablets. \u201cWith our IP, we can essentially develop screen protection for any mobile device that has use for a screen protector and features a backlit display,\u201d Brown said.\n\nBrown described Screen Skinz\u2019s fundraising process as \u201cdifferent,\u201d stating that it took the company about a year to close its seed round. Brown and Canning intentionally took their time, as they also sought to refine their supply chain and prepare inventory for a mass go-to-market. \u201cWe wanted to do the work of selling a realistic vision to investors,\u201d Brown said.\n\nScreen Skinz met its co-lead investor, Abo Ventures, through Brown\u2019s network from when he worked at Texas A&M. They then met South Loop Ventures while participating in DivInc\u2019s Sports Tech Accelerator in Houston.\n\nMichelle Micone, the former SVP of consumer products at NFL and Hasbro, said she liked that the team had a unique concept and also figured out the manufacturing and logistics of producing it. \u201cCustomers want a high level of personalization, but it\u2019s really, really hard to deliver on time and at a reasonable price. Screen Skinz has that formula, and I wanted to be part of it,\u201d she told TechCrunch.\n\nOther investors in the round include Brent Montgomery, the CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment, alongside Wayne Pfeffer and Brendan O\u2019Donnel, former directors of worldwide mobile accessory products at Apple. Pfeffer, in particular, was also sold on the idea of making screen protectors more personalizable. \u201cFor years, personalizing your device was limited to the case,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cWhen I saw the evolution to the front on a screen protector, I was sold!\u201d\n\nBrown said the company could look to raise as early as next year again.

{"title": "Screen Skinz raises $1.5M seed to create custom screen protectors", "text": "Clay Canning had an idea while in high school: smartphone screen protectors that featured logos, right on the screen.\n\nHe later connected with Rashaun Brown, who was working in sports and licensing at the time, and the idea for Screen Skinz was born.\n\n\u201cWe both understood the opportunity and complemented each other\u2019s weakness,\u201d Brown, the company\u2019s CEO, told TechCrunch. \u201cIn December 2022, I resigned from my job to pursue building Screen Skinz with Clay full-time.\u201d\n\nNow, Screen Skinz can officially announce the closing of a $1.5 million seed round led by South Loop Ventures and Abo Ventures.\n\nThe company produces custom, patent-pending phone screen protectors that feature personalized logos or slogans that are visible when the phone screen is black and then disappear when the phone is in use. Customers can create their own designs or pick from the company\u2019s existing catalog.\n\nPhone accessories have always been a massive market, with the global screen protector market alone worth an estimated $51 billion as of 2023.\n\nScreen Skinz already holds creative licenses with various big-name brands, working with organizations such as the NFL and NBA and entertainment brands like Marvel and the WWE.\n\nThe latest fundraise allowed Screen Skinz to move manufacturing from Asia to the U.S., where it could more easily control its supply chain.\n\nThe company is looking to double down on the screen protection industry, and though it currently only focuses on smartphones, there is a plan to one day expand to making screen protectors for tablets. \u201cWith our IP, we can essentially develop screen protection for any mobile device that has use for a screen protector and features a backlit display,\u201d Brown said.\n\nBrown described Screen Skinz\u2019s fundraising process as \u201cdifferent,\u201d stating that it took the company about a year to close its seed round. Brown and Canning intentionally took their time, as they also sought to refine their supply chain and prepare inventory for a mass go-to-market. \u201cWe wanted to do the work of selling a realistic vision to investors,\u201d Brown said.\n\nScreen Skinz met its co-lead investor, Abo Ventures, through Brown\u2019s network from when he worked at Texas A&M. They then met South Loop Ventures while participating in DivInc\u2019s Sports Tech Accelerator in Houston.\n\nMichelle Micone, the former SVP of consumer products at NFL and Hasbro, said she liked that the team had a unique concept and also figured out the manufacturing and logistics of producing it. \u201cCustomers want a high level of personalization, but it\u2019s really, really hard to deliver on time and at a reasonable price. Screen Skinz has that formula, and I wanted to be part of it,\u201d she told TechCrunch.\n\nOther investors in the round include Brent Montgomery, the CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment, alongside Wayne Pfeffer and Brendan O\u2019Donnel, former directors of worldwide mobile accessory products at Apple. Pfeffer, in particular, was also sold on the idea of making screen protectors more personalizable. \u201cFor years, personalizing your device was limited to the case,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cWhen I saw the evolution to the front on a screen protector, I was sold!\u201d\n\nBrown said the company could look to raise as early as next year again. Screen Skinz has some partnerships lined up and is focused on customer acquisition and deepening licensing relationships.", "authors": "['Dominic-Madori Davis']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screen-Skinz.png?resize=1200,866", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

These loans required that recipients who earned more than $50,000 in a related industry pay BloomTech 17% of their pre-tax income each month until reaching the 24-payment or $30,000 total repayment threshold.\n\nBloomTech didn\u2019t market the loans as loans, really, saying that they didn\u2019t create debt and were \u201crisk free\u201d \u2014 and advertised a 71% to 86% job placement rate.

{"title": "Dark is building a rocket-powered boxing glove to push debris out of orbit", "text": "Paris-based Dark is taking on the dual problems of debris and conflict in orbit with their mobile platform designed to launch, attach to, and ultimately de-orbit uncooperative objects in space.\n\nDark CEO Clyde Laheyne said the company is aiming to become the \u201cS.W.A.T. team of space.\u201d\n\nThe three-year-old startup is developing Interceptor, a spacecraft that is essentially a rocket-powered boxing glove that can be launched on short order to gently punch a wayward object out of its orbit.\n\nInterceptor is launched from a specially outfitted aircraft. Much like a Virgin Galactic launch, the aircraft will take the rocket above the tumultuous lower atmosphere, where it can be released and ignited. Once the rocket reaches the vicinity of the target object, the spacecraft detaches and uses onboard sensors and propulsion to find and approach it. When it\u2019s lined up correctly, Interceptor pushes against the object with its cushioned \u201ceffector,\u201d eventually de-orbiting it.\n\n\u201cAll the space sector is organized to do planned, long missions \u2026 but orbital defense is more about unplanned, short missions,\u201d Laheyne said. In that sense, Interceptor \u201cis more like an air defense missile,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt has to be ready all the time. There is no excuse to not be able to use it.\u201d\n\nUnlike an actual missile or anti-satellite weapon, however, the gentle strike of the Interceptor doesn\u2019t produce a debris field or any other dangerous, unpredictable effects.\n\nDark was founded by Laheyne and CTO Guillaume Orvain, engineers who cut their teeth at multi-national missile developer MBDA. This work experience shines through in the Interceptor concept, which is being designed to operate on-call, similar to missile systems. That\u2019s also why Dark is developing its own launching platform: to ensure readiness for defense, civil and commercial companies at a moment\u2019s notice, Laheyne said.\n\nDark closed a $5 million funding round in 2021, with the cap table composed of European investors, including lead investor Eurazeo. The team closed a $6 million extension yesterday, including participation from its first U.S.-based investor, Long Journey Ventures. (That fund is led by Arielle Zuckerberg, the younger sister of Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg.)\n\nThe company has a lot of work ahead before it comes close to removing something like a defunct rocket second stage from orbit. Dark has been focused on developing critical systems, like the cryogenic engine and software. Now the team is shifting its focus to developing the technologies needed for the type of unplanned, quick missions Interceptor will execute, like long-distance detecting and tracking, autonomous flight algorithms, and a system for reliable controlled reentry.\n\nThe team must also retrofit an aircraft \u2014 which Laheyne estimated could cost $50 million, or around the price of building a new launch pad \u2014 and have the entire platform ready for a demonstration mission in 2026.\n\nThat mission would validate many of the core technologies of the full-scale platform, though it won\u2019t actually aim to de-orbit an object, just touch one. Even this is incredibly ambitious: No company has yet cracked so-called rendezvous and proximity operations, meaning moving close to another object in space and interacting with it.\n\nThe second demonstration mission, which is currently planed for 2027, will include a de-orbit attempt. If all goes to plan, the company would start de-orbiting objects for allied civil agencies. As far as defense customers go, \u201chopefully we don\u2019t have to use it,\u201d Laheyne said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing missiles for years, and it\u2019s always the same topic: If you use it first, it\u2019s an act of war. If you\u2019re second, it\u2019s an act of defense. If you can do it, and people know you can do it, it\u2019s dissuasion,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ideal is dissuasion, the system that makes the conflict unthinkable.\u201d", "authors": "['Aria Alamalhodaei']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-17-at-2.48.44-PM.png?resize=1200,552", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "Cherub, an angel investing community inspired by dating apps, entices investors and founders to pair up", "text": "Jaclyn Johnson and Angeline Vuong were on a hike deliberating how hard it can be for people to get started in angel investing when they realized they had stumbled upon a startup idea.\n\nToday they are the co-founders of Cherub, a marketplace that pairs angel investors with entrepreneurs.\n\nVuong spent nearly five years working in product and growth at Opendoor. Johnson founded Create & Cultivate, a self-described \u201cmedia company for ambitious women\u201d and had experienced both sides of the investing world \u2014 as a founder and an investor. Before starting Create & Cultivate, Johnson sold her own startup (No Subject) in 2016 and invested in numerous companies, including luggage company Away.\n\nJohnson likens Los Angeles-based Cherub to Raya, an online membership-based community for dating, in that it matches founders and angel investors based on their preferences.\n\n\u201cYou can go to this platform as an entrepreneur and you can go on the platform as an angel investor and get access to both people and express interest based on tags,\u201d she said in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cSo for instance, if I go on the app and I\u2019m interested in women-owned businesses in the CPG space doing their Series A or something specific, I\u2019ll get surface deal flow that is the highest match to what I\u2019m looking for.\u201d\n\nWith Cherub, investors and entrepreneurs can see who is interested in them on the back end. If they too are interested, they can indicate it as such and it\u2019s a match. Conversely, if an investor approaches a founder but that founder doesn\u2019t view them as a potential fit, they can reject the invitation to connect. Or if an entrepreneur\u2019s minimum investment is $25,000 but an angel investor is only investing $10,000 per deal, they can see that and not reach out to connect.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sort of using dating app mechanics in a way,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSo we jokingly call it the Raya for deal flow.\u201d\n\nMembership-based\n\nTo test the concept for Cherub, Johnson and Voung last year first started a weekly newsletter that got 1,500 sign-ups within three weeks on word of mouth alone.\n\nEncouraged, the pair built out an alpha product last summer that featured about 40 companies and gave investors a way to request a deck. All 40 got requests for deck views, Johnson said. Half of those deck views resulted in an introduction, she said, where investors expressed that they were interested in being pitched by the founder. Twenty percent of those introductions ended up getting funded in less than three months, collectively raising $1.1 million in capital.\n\nOf those deals, 40% were new angel investors, meaning they were accredited investors that had never written checks before.\n\nCherub is now in the process of a slow launch, with 100 startups on the platform generating revenue of $50,000. They plan to grow that to 500, and have a waitlist of 1,500 startups, Johnson said.\n\nCherub is free for investors to use and charges startups via a membership model. A $480/year membership lets founders list their companies in the directory and includes analytics such as how many people viewed their deck. The Cherub Select membership costs $950 a year and involves a more vetted process to show the company more actively to investors, Johnson said.\n\nJohnson said that Cherub also helps founders find incubators and accelerators and has partnerships with the associated incubators of firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Dream Ventures and New York Fashion Tech Lab.\n\nInvestors also get access to data such as \u201cupdates on how a company is performing, whether they\u2019re raising or not and how much,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nOf course Cherub is not the only platform teaming up angels with entrepreneurs. AngelList is the biggest and best known. Israeli crowdsourcing firm OurCrowd is also huge, and then there are the ones offered by venture firms, like Hustle Squad\u2019s Angel Squad for accredited investors, or others like Jason Calacanis\u2019 The Syndicate.\n\nBut Cherub is different in a number of ways, Johnson says. For one, it features startups with an emphasis on consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies. Though it also includes AI companies, hotel projects and apps, among others.\n\nAngelList is more of a B2B platform, is very tech industry centric and is best for those who already have knowledge or experience in startup investing and can afford to invest fairly sizable amounts, in Johnson\u2019s view.\n\nThen there\u2019s crowdsourcing Wefunder or Republic, which will allow investors to invest tiny amounts, sometimes as little as $100, which Johnson describes as \u201cthe kickstarter of angel investing.\u201d\n\nCherub sits in the middle, she says. For instance, like traditional VC firms, the company hosts \u201cfounder-funder mixers.\u201d Last year, for example, Cherub teamed up with Sophia Amoruso\u2019s Trust Fund to host a cocktail party at which \u201cevery single thing on site was investable,\u201d such as the drinks being served and featuring a pop-up shop where guests could \u201cshop any products that they want to test drive.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom that event alone, over $400,000 in deals were generated,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nAngel investor Allen Orr told TechCrunch that he had used other platforms such as AngelList in the past.\n\n\u201cHowever, I felt that it was not a very personal experience and felt too transactional,\u201d he told TechCrunch via email. \u201cWhat appealed to me about Cherub was the idea of a tailored and social approach to investing,\u201d he said, adding \u201cI also liked that there are opportunities not just for investment but also advising brands.\u201d\n\nMaggie Rose Macar, founder and CEO of mental health support app Zant, said an investor wrote a $25,000 check into her company after it was featured in one of the earliest versions of Cherub\u2019s newsletters and after she met the investor in person at one of Cherub\u2019s events.\n\n\u201cI think Cherub does a great job at bringing active investors into the room with founders who are looking,\u201d she told TechCrunch.\n\nCherub has raised $1.25 million of its own, naturally from angels, including Drybar\u2019s Alli Webb and Blavity\u2019s Morgan DeBaun, among others.", "authors": "['Mary Ann Azevedo']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cherub.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "Cherub, an angel investing community inspired by dating apps, entices investors and founders to pair up", "text": "Jaclyn Johnson and Angeline Vuong were on a hike deliberating how hard it can be for people to get started in angel investing when they realized they had stumbled upon a startup idea.\n\nToday they are the co-founders of Cherub, a marketplace that pairs angel investors with entrepreneurs.\n\nVuong spent nearly five years working in product and growth at Opendoor. Johnson founded Create & Cultivate, a self-described \u201cmedia company for ambitious women\u201d and had experienced both sides of the investing world \u2014 as a founder and an investor. Before starting Create & Cultivate, Johnson sold her own startup (No Subject) in 2016 and invested in numerous companies, including luggage company Away.\n\nJohnson likens Los Angeles-based Cherub to Raya, an online membership-based community for dating, in that it matches founders and angel investors based on their preferences.\n\n\u201cYou can go to this platform as an entrepreneur and you can go on the platform as an angel investor and get access to both people and express interest based on tags,\u201d she said in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cSo for instance, if I go on the app and I\u2019m interested in women-owned businesses in the CPG space doing their Series A or something specific, I\u2019ll get surface deal flow that is the highest match to what I\u2019m looking for.\u201d\n\nWith Cherub, investors and entrepreneurs can see who is interested in them on the back end. If they too are interested, they can indicate it as such and it\u2019s a match.

{"title": "NeuBird is building a generative AI solution for complex cloud-native environments", "text": "NeuBird founders Goutham Rao and Vinod Jayaraman came from Portworx, a cloud-native storage solution they eventually sold to PureStorage in 2019 for $370 million. It was their third successful exit.\n\nWhen they went looking for their next startup challenge last year, they saw an opportunity to combine their cloud-native knowledge, especially around IT operations, with the burgeoning area of generative AI.\n\nToday NeuBird announced a $22 million investment from Mayfield to get the idea to market. It\u2019s a hefty amount for an early-stage startup, but the firm is likely banking on the founders\u2019 experience to build another successful company.\n\nRao, the CEO, says that while the cloud-native community has done a good job at solving a lot of difficult problems, it has created increasing levels of complexity along the way.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done an incredible job as a community over the past 10-plus years building cloud-native architectures with service-oriented designs. This added a lot of layers, which is good. That\u2019s a proper way to design software, but this also came at a cost of increased telemetry. There\u2019s just too many layers in the stack,\u201d Rao told TechCrunch.\n\nThey concluded that this level of data was making it impossible for human engineers to find, diagnose and solve problems at scale inside large organizations. At the same time, large language models were beginning to mature, so the founders decided to put them to work on the problem.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re leveraging large language models in a very unique way to be able to analyze thousands and thousands of metrics, alerts, logs, traces and application configuration information in a matter of seconds and be able to diagnose what the health of the environment is, detect if there\u2019s a problem and come up with a solution,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company is essentially building a trusted digital assistant to the engineering team. \u201cSo it\u2019s a digital co-worker that works alongside SREs and ITOps engineers, and monitors all of the alerts and logs looking for issues,\u201d he said. The goal is to reduce the amount of time it takes to respond to and solve an incident from hours to minutes, and they believe that by putting generative AI to work on the problem, they can help companies achieve that goal.\n\nThe founders understand the limitations of large language models, and are looking to reduce hallucinated or incorrect responses by using a limited set of data to train the models, and by setting up other systems that help deliver more accurate responses.\n\n\u201cBecause we\u2019re using this in a very controlled manner for a very specific use case for environments we know, we can cross check the results that are coming out of the AI, again through a vector database and see if it\u2019s even making sense and if we\u2019re not comfortable with it, we won\u2019t recommend it to the user.\u201d\n\nCustomers can connect directly to their various cloud systems by entering their credentials, and without moving data, NeuBird can use the access to cross-check against other available information to come up with a solution, reducing the overall difficulty associated with getting the company-specific data for the model to work with.\n\nNeuBird uses various models, including Llama 2 for analyzing logs and metrics. They are using Mistral for other types of analysis. The company actually turns every natural language interaction into a SQL query, essentially turning unstructured data into structured data. They believe this will result in greater accuracy.\n\nThe early-stage startup is working with design and alpha partners right now refining the idea as they work to bring the product to market later this year. Rao says they took a big chunk of money out of the gate because they wanted the room to work on the problem without having to worry about looking for more money too soon.", "authors": "['Ron Miller']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1420039843.jpg?resize=1200,646", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "Inversion Space will test its space-based delivery tech in October", "text": "Inversion Space is aptly named. The three-year-old startup\u2019s primary concern is not getting things to space, but bringing them back \u2014 transforming the ultimate high ground into \u201ca transportation layer for Earth.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s plan \u2014 ultra-fast, on-demand deliveries to anywhere on Earth \u2014 sounds like pie in the sky, but it\u2019s the sort of moonshot goal that could transform terrestrial cargo transportation. The aim is to send up fleets of earth-orbiting vehicles that will be able to shoot back to Earth at Mach speeds, slow with specially-made parachutes and deliver cargo in minutes.\n\nInversion has developed a pathfinder vehicle, called Ray, that\u2019s a technical precursor to a larger platform that will debut in 2026. Ray will head to space this October, on SpaceX\u2019s Transporter-12 rideshare mission, paving the way for Inversion\u2019s future plans on orbit (and back).\n\nRay is small \u2014 about twice the diameter of a standard frisbee \u2014 and will spend anywhere from one to five weeks in space, depending on factors like weather and how the orbit aligns with the landing site, Inversion CEO Justin Fiaschetti explained in a recent interview.\n\nThis first mission will have three phases: the initial on-orbit phase, where the spacecraft will power on, charge its batteries and hopefully send telemetry to the ground. During the second phase, Ray will use its onboard propulsion system to slow down the vehicle so it starts losing altitude and reentering the atmosphere. The reentry capsule will separate from the satellite bus (both designed in-house), with the latter structure burning up.\n\nThe third and final phase will see Ray slow down using a supersonic drogue parachute, from a reentry speed of Mach 1.8 to Mach 0.2. The main parachute will then deploy, further slowing the capsule to a soft splashdown off the coast of California.\n\nImpressively, the company has designed and built almost all of the Ray vehicle in-house, from the propulsion system to the structure to the parachutes. This last component is key: Almost no space company designs parachutes themselves, and they\u2019re incredibly challenging to engineer from the ground up. Inversion\u2019s engineering team completed qualification testing of the deployment and parachute systems last year.\n\nWe\u2019ve completed a successful qualification campaign of the full recovery system for Ray, our pathfinder vehicle! Both of the parachutes and their deployment systems have been developed in-house by our recovery engineers, Connor & Daniel. pic.twitter.com/mPquy1nGbE \u2014 Inversion (@InversionSpace) September 5, 2023\n\nFiaschetti said strong vertical integration has helped the company move so quickly.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of our Ray vehicle is to develop technology for our next-gen vehicle. As such, we\u2019ve built basically the entire vehicle in-house,\u201d Fiaschetti said. \u201cWhat we saw was that if we can build in-house now, do the hard thing first, that allows us to scale very quickly and meet our customer needs.\u201d\n\nThe reentry vehicle is totally passive \u2014 meaning it doesn\u2019t have active controls to navigate its reentry to Earth \u2014 but the company\u2019s larger next-gen vehicle, called Arc, will have \u201cfootball field-level\u201d accuracy.\n\nInversion was founded by CEO Justin Fiaschetti and CTO Austin Briggs in 2021, but the two go back further: They met when they sat next to each other at a Boston University freshman matriculation ceremony. The pair eventually got jobs in southern California \u2014 Briggs, as a propulsion development engineer at ABL Space Systems, while Fiaschetti had brief engineering stints at Relativity and SpaceX \u2014 and they were actually roommates when they first floated the idea of developing technology to deliver cargo anywhere on Earth.\n\nThe company went through Y Combinator in the summer of 2021 (it was one of our favorites from the cohort) and closed its $10 million seed round in November that same year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been off to the races ever since,\u201d Fiaschetti said. The company\u2019s grown to 25 employees, who are based out of Torrance, California, where they have a 5,000-square-foot facility. The startup also owns five acres of land in the Mojave Desert, where it conducts engine testing. The scaling of the team and this first mission have been entirely financed by that seed round.\n\nThe startup sees promising markets in both government agencies and private companies; both segments could use Inversion\u2019s reusable platform as an on-orbit testbed, or as a delivery vehicle to a private commercial space station. Inversion is aiming on pushing both reusability and duration-on-orbit \u201cto the maximum\u201d to bring down costs and also to support different mission profiles, Fiaschetti said.\n\nInversion aims to fly the next-gen vehicle, Arc, for the first time in 2026. While the two co-founders declined to provide more details on the spacecraft, the company\u2019s website says it will be capable of carrying more than 150 kilograms of cargo, to provide \u201cproliferated\u201d delivery in space.\n\n\u201cWe are testing hardware consistently. We\u2019re developing an infrastructure to be able to scale ourselves. Just as our decision to bring parachutes in-house was a decision because the parachutes are so directly applicable to what we\u2019re building, it\u2019s making those kinds of key decisions that allows us to move much faster than another reentry vehicle would take much longer to develop.\u201d", "authors": "['Aria Alamalhodaei']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Inversion-Ray.jpg?resize=1200,800", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "Fintech Mercury, whose B2B business is caught up in regulatory scrutiny, expands into consumer banking", "text": "Business banking startup Mercury, founded in 2017, is now launching a consumer banking product. Mercury today serves more than 100,000 businesses, many of which are startups, via its B2B practice.\n\nThe expansion is a natural move for the company and one that has been in the works for a couple of years, according to Immad Akhund, Mercury\u2019s co-founder and CEO.\n\n\u201cWe already have a few hundred thousand users of our business banking product, and a lot of people have expressed that they want a personal banking product,\u201d he told TechCrunch in an interview.\n\nWhile there are plenty of neobanks, many of them \u201cfocus on the underbanked. It\u2019s not a great market for power users\u201d who need features like wire transfers or support for multiple users, features that Mercury\u2019s service offers, according to Akhund. Other features are of the type expected by banking power users: multiple debit cards with custom spending limits, access up to $5 million in FDIC insurance through its partner banks and their sweep networks, and interest-bearing savings accounts.\n\nEssentially, Mercury hopes to convert many of its business clients into customers. It\u2019s not going after the masses like say Chime or Dave.\n\nThe expansion into personal banking comes at an interesting time for Mercury, which recently made headlines for being the target of federal scrutiny around its practice of allowing foreign companies to open accounts through one of its partners, Choice Bank.\n\nAccording to a report by The Information, the FDIC was \u201cconcerned\u201d that Choice \u201chad opened Mercury accounts in legally risky countries.\u201d Officials also reportedly chastised Choice for letting overseas Mercury customers \u201copen thousands of accounts using questionable methods to prove they had a presence in the U.S.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s not all. The FDIC also wasn\u2019t happy that Choice hadn\u2019t \u201cvetted a compliance system Mercury was using, which the agency said was flagging a curiously low number of suspicious transactions.\u201d\n\nAdding fuel to the fire, Mercury also earlier this year reportedly told users with Evolve Bank & Trust-issued debit cards that those cards would no longer work where the merchant has a legal address in 41 countries, including Turkey, Ukraine, Cuba and Iran. (Evolve is also a partner of Mercury\u2019s.) When TechCrunch asked about these allegations, the company declined to comment.\n\nWhen asked about The Information\u2019s report, a Mercury spokesperson emphasized that the company is investing in its risk and compliance teams. The person also said the fintech partner banking market as a whole has been the target of more regulatory scrutiny.\n\nAlexey Likuev, who led the buildout of the consumer offering for Mercury, acknowledges there are \u201cdefinitely more rigorous regulations around consumer protection\u201d and said the company has been mindful of those regulations when it built out its consumer product.\n\nCrossing over\n\nBut success in B2B banking doesn\u2019t automatically queue up Mercury to handle consumer banking. Each has differing regulations and compliance issues, noted Gartner analyst Agustin Rubini. Risk management for personal banking, for instance, is about assessing the individual\u2019s financial stability, \u201cwhich can be less predictable compared to businesses,\u201d he said.\n\nMore than that, adhering to stringent regulatory requirements can be \u201cchallenging\u201d for startups, he warns. \u201cThe complexities increase when partnering with a bank due to the additional layers of regulation that apply to banking services,\u201d he said. \u201cThis includes everything from anti-money laundering (AML) protocols to meeting capital requirements.\u201d\n\nRubini added that partnering with a bank can help the startup by providing an initial platform and compliance framework, but then scaling up operations to a larger customer base can open up a different can of worms. Startups need \u201csubstantial capital and strategic planning\u201d to do that well while staying competitive, and without running afoul of regulators.\n\nCesare Fracassi, associate professor of finance at the University of Texas at Austin, also told TechCrunch that business and consumer banking are \u201ctwo different beasts, two different types of services.\u201d But he\u2019s a bit more bullish on fintechs trying their hand at both because he does see \u201cobvious synergies involved in owning both the business and person\u201d in the banking space.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the main reasons Mercury is expanding in this direction. It could leverage much of the software powering its B2B product for its consumer offering, Akhund said.\n\nIt\u2019s also not the only fintech thinking like this. Onyx Private, with a similar offering, recently did a reverse move, pivoting from B2C to B2B.\n\nBesides earning revenue off of interchange fees and the interest rate spread, Mercury will make money by charging users an annual subscription fee of $240 upon the first deposit and then annually after that. Last year, it touted a big bump in business following the SVB crisis, and a recent report from Kruze Consulting showed that 40% of startups created after the SVB crisis have an account with Mercury.\n\nThe company said it\u2019s had seven consecutive quarters of cash flow and EBITDA profitability as of March 2024. While it would not reveal hard revenue figures, it also claims that its new revenue grew by 180% last year while its customer base climbed by 60% and transaction volume by 90% to $95 billion as of January 2024.\n\nWith that growth, the startup has been hiring. Presently Mercury has 620 employees, compared to 440 at the start of 2023.\n\nWant more fintech news in your inbox? Sign up for TechCrunch Fintech here.\n\nWant to reach out with a tip?

{"title": "How Found Energy went from \u2018self-cannibalizing robots\u2019 to cleaning up heavy industry", "text": "Found Energy doesn\u2019t have the typical startup origin story: It began with a space robot that was supposed to eat itself. Now, the company is developing that same technology with an eye toward powering aluminum smelters and long-haul shipping.\n\nNearly a decade ago, Peter Godart, Found Energy\u2019s co-founder and CEO, was a scientist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He and some colleagues were brainstorming how to power a probe that might visit Jupiter\u2019s moon, Europa. The team was debating the energy density of batteries that might be suitable when a stray thought landed in Godart\u2019s head. The aluminum used to make the spacecraft held more than 10 times the energy of any cutting-edge battery. Why not use the spacecraft\u2019s parts to power itself?\n\n\u201cThey gave me a bunch of money to start a program that I lovingly called the \u2018self-cannibalizing robot lab,\u2019\u201d Godart told TechCrunch. \u201cWe looked at giving robots the ability to consume their vestigial aluminum components for fuel.\u201d\n\nBut as he continued his research, Godart had another thought. \u201cI had a moment where I realized my time would be better spent solving Earth problems,\u201d he said. His timing couldn\u2019t have been better. Congress cut some of the funding for the Europa missions, and JPL let Godart take the intellectual property to MIT where he continued to work on the problem during his doctorate.\n\nTo Godart, aluminum had several obvious upsides: It\u2019s the most abundant metal in the Earth\u2019s crust, it can store twice as much energy per unit volume as diesel without being volatile and it\u2019s possible to recover as heat 70% of the original electrical energy used to smelt it. \u201cI was like, oh my god, we got to do something with this,\u201d he said.\n\nTo release the energy embodied in refined aluminum, Godart had to figure out how to get past the metal\u2019s defenses, so to speak. \u201cIf you throw a chunk of aluminum in water and try to oxidize it using water, it would take thousands of years,\u201d he said.\n\nGodart\u2019s process is much, much faster. Once water is dropped on aluminum coated in Found Energy\u2019s catalyst, the metal\u2019s surface quickly starts bubbling as the reaction releases heat and hydrogen gas. Within seconds, the aluminum starts expanding as the hydrogen bubbles force it to exfoliate. That allows water to penetrate further into the metal, repeating the process over and over again until all that\u2019s left is a gray powder. \u201cWe actually call it fractal exfoliation,\u201d Godart said.\n\nFound Energy harvests the resulting steam and hydrogen, each of which can be used for a range of industrial processes. \u201cOne of the hardest elements of heavy industry to decarbonize is the heat,\u201d Godart said. \u201cAnd now here we have this really flexible way of providing heat across a very wide range of temperatures, all the way down from 80 to 100 degrees Celsius all the way up to 1,000 degrees Celsius.\u201d In total, about 8.6 megawatt-hours of energy can be recovered per metric ton of aluminum.\n\nWhat\u2019s left isn\u2019t waste, either. The catalyst can be recovered, and the powder is aluminum trihydrate, which can be smelted once more to create metallic aluminum. Any contaminants, including food waste, plastic soda can liners and mixed alloys, remain larger than the aluminum trihydrate powder and can be easily filtered out.\n\n\u201cAll of that stuff works in our process, because our catalyst just eats aluminum and basically leaves everything else untouched,\u201d Godart said.\n\nFound Energy recently raised an oversubscribed $12 million seed round, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. Investors in the round include the Autodesk Foundation, GiTV, Glenfield Partners, Good Growth Capital, J-Impact, Kompas VC, the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center and Munich Re Ventures.\n\nWhen using scrap aluminum, which is Found Energy\u2019s initial plan, the process is carbon negative. The startup is targeting industrial heat in its go-to-market strategy, but Godart also sees applications in marine shipping and long-haul trucking. Aluminum is slightly heavier than diesel or bunker fuel, but its energy density could be game-changing for those industries.\n\nOne could imagine future ships powered by aluminum dropping their waste powder off at a smelter to be refueled for a return voyage. \u201cJust sip a little bit of that energy as you go, and then you\u2019ve essentially come up with a new maritime shipping fuel as well,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a weird way, we\u2019re sort of revamping the concept of a solid fuel.\u201d", "authors": "['Tim De Chant']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Gadi-Ruschin-found-energy.jpg?resize=1200,800", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}

{"title": "Investors are growing increasingly weary of AI", "text": "After years of easy money, the AI industry is facing a reckoning.\n\nA new report from Stanford\u2019s Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI), which studies AI trends, found that global investment in AI fell for the second year in a row in 2023.\n\nBoth private investment \u2014 that is, investments in startups from VCs \u2014 and corporate investment \u2014 mergers and acquisitions \u2014 in the AI industry were on the downswing in 2023 versus the year prior, according to the report, which cites data from market intelligence firm Quid.\n\nAI-related mergers and acquisitions fell from $117.16 billion in 2022 to $80.61 billion in 2023, down 31.2%; private investment dipped from $103.4 billion to $95.99 billion. Factoring in minority stake deals and public offerings, total investment in AI dropped to $189.2 billion last year, a 20% decline compared to 2022.\n\nYet some AI ventures continue to attract substantial tranches, like Anthropic\u2019s recent multibillion-dollar investment from Amazon and Microsoft\u2019s $650 million acquisition of Inflection AI\u2019s top talent (if not the company itself). And more AI companies are receiving investments than ever before, with 1,812 AI startups announcing funding in 2023, up 40.6% versus 2022, according to the Stanford HAI report.\n\nSo what\u2019s going on?\n\nGartner analyst John-David Lovelock says that he sees AI investing \u201cspreading out\u201d as the largest players \u2014 Anthropic, OpenAI and so on \u2014 stake out their ground.\n\n\u201cThe count of billion-dollar investments has slowed and is all but over,\u201d Lovelock told TechCrunch. \u201cLarge AI models require massive investments. The market is now more influenced by the tech companies that\u2019ll utilize existing AI products, services and offerings to build new offerings.\u201d\n\nUmesh Padval, managing director at Thomvest Ventures, attributes the shrinking overall investment in AI to slower-than-expected growth. The initial wave of enthusiasm has given way to the reality, he says: that AI is beset with challenges \u2014 some technical, some go-to-market \u2014 that\u2019ll take years to address and fully overcome.\n\n\u201cThe deceleration in AI investing reflects the recognition that we\u2019re still navigating the early phases of the AI evolution and its practical implementation across industries,\u201d Padval said. \u201cWhile the long-term market potential remains immense, the initial exuberance has been tempered by the complexities and challenges of scaling AI technologies in real-world applications \u2026 This suggests a more mature and discerning investment landscape.\u201d\n\nOther factors could be afoot.\n\nGreylock partner Seth Rosenberg contends that there\u2019s simply less appetite to fund \u201ca bunch of new players\u201d in the AI space.\n\n\u201cWe saw a lot of investment in foundation models during the early part of this cycle, which are very capital intensive,\u201d he said. \u201cCapital required for AI applications and agents is lower than other parts of the stack, which may be why funding on an absolute dollar basis is down.\u201d\n\nAaron Fleishman, a partner at Tola Capital, says that investors might be coming to the realization that they\u2019ve been too reliant on \u201cprojected exponential growth\u201d to justify AI startups\u2019 sky-high valuations. To give one example, AI company Stability AI, which was valued at over $1 billion in late 2022, reportedly brought in just $11 million in revenue in 2023 while spending $153 million on operating expenses.\n\n\u201cThe performance trajectories of companies like Stability AI might hint at challenges looming ahead,\u201d Fleishman said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a more deliberate approach by investors in evaluating AI investments compared to a year ago. The rapid rise and fall of certain marquee name startups in AI over the past year has illustrated the need for investors to refine and sharpen their view and understanding of the AI value chain and defensibility within the stack.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeliberate\u201d seems to be the name of the game now, indeed.\n\nAccording to a PitchBook report compiled for TechCrunch, VCs invested $25.87 billion globally in AI startups in Q1 2024, up from $21.69 billion in Q1 2023. But the Q1 2024 investments spanned across only 1,545 deals compared to 1,909 in Q1 2023. Mergers and acquisitions, meanwhile, slowed from 195 in Q1 2023 to 176 in Q1 2024.\n\nDespite the general malaise within AI investor circles, generative AI \u2014 AI that creates new content, such as text, images, music and videos \u2014 remains a bright spot.\n\nFunding for generative AI startups reached $25.2 billion in 2023, per the Stanford HAI report, nearly ninefold the investment in 2022 and about 30 times the amount from 2019. And generative AI accounted for over a quarter of all AI-related investments in 2023.\n\nSamir Kumar, co-founder of Touring Capital, doesn\u2019t think that the boom times will last, however. \u201cWe\u2019ll soon be evaluating whether generative AI delivers the promised efficiency gains at scale and drives top-line growth through AI-integrated products and services,\u201d Kumar said. \u201cIf these anticipated milestones aren\u2019t met and we remain primarily in an experimental phase, revenues from \u2018experimental run rates\u2019 might not transition into sustainable annual recurring revenue.\u201d\n\nTo Kumar\u2019s point, several high-profile VCs, including Meritech Capital \u2014 whose bets include Facebook and Salesforce \u2014 TCV, General Atlantic and Blackstone, have steered clear of generative AI so far. And generative AI\u2019s largest customers, corporations, seem increasingly skeptical of the tech\u2019s promises, and whether it can deliver on them.\n\nIn a pair of recent surveys from Boston Consulting Group, about half of the respondents \u2014 all C-suite executives \u2014 said that they don\u2019t expect generative AI to bring about substantial productivity gains and that they\u2019re worried about the potential for mistakes and data compromises arising from generative AI-powered tools.\n\nBut whether skepticism and the financial downtrends that can stem from it are a bad thing depends on your point of view.\n\nFor Padval\u2019s part, he sees the AI industry undergoing a \u201cnecessary\u201d correction to \u201cbubble-like investment fervor.\u201d And, in his belief, there\u2019s light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re moving to a more sustainable and normalized pace in 2024,\u201d he said. \u201cWe anticipate this stable investment rhythm to persist throughout the remainder of this year \u2026 While there may be periodic adjustments in investment pace, the overall trajectory for AI investment remains robust and poised for sustained growth.\u201d\n\nWe shall see.", "authors": "['Kyle Wiggers']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GettyImages-1463459171.jpg?resize=1200,800", "keywords": "[]", "summary": ""}
