        "text": "What is a photo? No, like really. What is a photo? What is a photo? What is a photo? What is a photo? When you tap the shutter button on your phone, and it grabs nearly a dozen frames out of a cache that was capturing data well before you pressed anything, then stitches together the \u201cbest\u201d bits of each one before allowing you to edit everything about all of them, is any of that process you taking a photo? And in a world where AI is good enough to make everything look good, does it even matter? When you ask the question enough times, it becomes the size of the universe \u2014 and we\u2019ve definitely asked the question enough times to get there.\n\nOn this episode of The Vergecast, we dig into the question again from two different angles. First, we chat with Ben Sandofsky and Sebastiaan De With, the cocreators of the popular camera app Halide. We talk about their perception of the iPhone\u2019s camera, how people\u2019s use of cameras has changed over the years, and why Halide\u2019s new Process Zero mode, which removes all the iPhone\u2019s processing in favor of just capturing one frame at a time with no changes, has been such a hit with users.\n\nAfter that, The Verge\u2019s Allison Johnson joins the show to tell us about an experiment she\u2019s been running on herself. After reviewing this year\u2019s slate of AI phones with AI cameras, she decided to go all in on AI and let Google, Apple, and Samsung do all the work of taking and editing photos for her. We talk about how that approach changed the photos she captured, the way she captured them, and the way she feels about them now.\n\nFinally, The Verge\u2019s Victoria Song helps us answer a question from the Vergecast Hotline (866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com) about whether a pair of Pixel Buds or a set of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are the better option for audio on a run. We have some opinions. And some other options.\n\nIf you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, here are some links to get you started, first on all the \u201cwhat is a photo\u201d stuff:",

        "text": "Microsoft is planning to support the streaming of Xbox game libraries next month. Sources familiar with Microsoft\u2019s plans tell The Verge that the company is getting ready to test the ability to stream games that you own that aren\u2019t part of the existing Xbox Game Pass library.\n\nAs part of a long-running project known as Project Lapland inside of Microsoft, the software giant has been readying its Xbox Cloud Gaming servers to be able to support streaming thousands of games. I\u2019m told Microsoft will first test its new Xbox Cloud Gaming streaming capabilities with Xbox Insiders in November, before expanding them to more Xbox users and more games.\n\nThe Xbox Cloud Gaming expansion comes in the same month Microsoft plans to enable game purchases in its Xbox mobile app for Android in the US. Microsoft is able to do this thanks to a court ruling earlier this week that forces Google to stop requiring Google Play Billing for apps in the Play Store on November 1st.\n\nXbox president Sarah Bond revealed yesterday that \u201cstarting in November, players will be able to play and purchase Xbox games directly from the Xbox App on Android.\u201d Once Microsoft\u2019s work to enable a full game library on Xbox Cloud Gaming is complete, you\u2019ll be able to purchase an Xbox game on Android and immediately stream it to your device.\n\nProject xCloud was supposed to launch with game library streaming in 2020. Microsoft then announced it would support your game library on Xbox Cloud Gaming in 2022, but it never launched that year. I understand the work has been complicated by having to prepare key infrastructure for thousands of games, instead of the hundreds that currently exist on Xbox Game Pass. While thousands of games will soon be available through Xbox Cloud Gaming, I\u2019m told some publishers will hold certain games back due to licensing requirements or deals.\n\nMicrosoft is also working on a browser-based Xbox mobile store that it was originally planning to launch in July. The store will initially include deals and in-game items but will grow to cover first-party games eventually. Microsoft said in August that testing had begun on the web-based mobile store and that \u201cwork is progressing well and we will have more to share in the future.\u201d\n\nUpdate, October 11th: Article updated to mention original Project xCloud plans.",

        "text": "There have been plenty of rumors swirling regarding a new iPad Mini for more than a year now, but most indicators point toward a processor bump and little else. We haven\u2019t heard much about a new entry-level iPad, though, which makes it a great time to pick up either the ninth- or 10th-gen model \u2014 both of which are still on sale for their best price to date in the wake of Amazon\u2019s October Prime Day sale.\n\nRight now, you can grab Apple\u2019s last-gen iPad at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target with Wi-Fi and 64GB of storage starting at $199 ($130 off). The 10th-gen model, meanwhile, is available from the same three retailers \u2014 Amazon, Best Buy, and Target \u2014 in the same configuration starting at $299 ($50 off). You can also pick up either with 256GB of storage for $349.99 ($130 off) and $449 ($50 off), respectively.\n\nBoth entry-level tablets are well-suited for streaming, browsing the web, and shooting off emails, though the newer model sports a slightly larger 10.9-inch screen and a faster processor in the form of Apple\u2019s A14 Bionic. It also features a USB-C port instead of Apple\u2019s Lightning connector (phew) and cribs some of the modern design language from the pricier iPad Air, resulting in smaller bezels and Touch ID fingerprint scanner in the power button.\n\nI\u2019d argue the 10th-gen model iPad is the better buy given its newer specs and current asking price; however, the ninth-gen model is still great for kids and anyone who wants a basic tablet at an affordable price. Hell, it even offers a 3.5mm headphone jack \u2014 a welcome rarity in 2024.\n\nVerge Deals on X / Join more than 50,000 followers and keep up with the best daily tech deals with @vergedeals Follow us!\n\nMore deals, discounts, and ways to save\n\nGoogle\u2019s Nest Thermostat is once again down to a mere $84.99 ($45 off) at Amazon, which is the lowest price we\u2019ve seen on the base model since July.

        "title": "Apple\u2019s Disclaimer uses sex and scandal to shape your perception of reality",
        "text": "Part of / The best entertainment of 2024\n\nDisclaimer feels like a direct response to the way studios have grown skittish about producing bona fide erotic thrillers aimed squarely at adults. Though the Apple TV Plus series is a cinematic delight and its lead performances are tremendous, its raw sexuality is what makes it seem like writer / director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n (Gravity, Children of Men) is trying to get you into a very specific kind of headspace. But what\u2019s brilliant about Disclaimer is the way it uses its sensuality to complicate your read on its wild puzzle box mystery.\n\nBased on Ren\u00e9e Knight\u2019s 2015 novel, Disclaimer tells the story of Catherine Ravenscroft (Cate Blanchett), a respected journalist whose life begins to unravel after she receives a copy of a strange manuscript titled \u201cThe Perfect Stranger.\u201d After Catherine\u2019s years of exposing the shady secrets of powerful people with her documentaries, there are plenty of people who might want their revenge. But as Catherine pages through \u201cThe Perfect Stranger,\u201d it becomes very obvious that the person behind it \u2014 retired teacher Stephen Brigstocke (Kevin Kline) \u2014 somehow knows things about her that no one could ever be privy to.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that \u201cThe Perfect Stranger\u201d gets into Catherine\u2019s personal life; it recounts with stunning clarity a specific summer from 20 years in the past when she (portrayed in flashback by Leila George) first met Stephen\u2019s 19-year-old son Jonathan (Louis Partridge) while vacationing with her own young son. Despite Catherine having kept her affair with Jonathan secret from her husband Robert (Sacha Baron Cohen), the manuscript describes in vivid detail every single one of the lovers\u2019 trysts. And with Jonathan having died under mysterious circumstances that same summer, Stephen\u2019s assertion that he blames Catherine for the death and plans to publish the book leaves her blood running cold.\n\nAs Catherine\u2019s fear shifts her into investigative reporter mode and she sets out to stop Stephen, Disclaimer leans further into its premise by narrating its story from a perspective that gives you insight into how \u201cThe Perfect Stranger\u201d impacts the people who receive pieces of it. Seeing so many of her darkest secrets spelled out in plain text sends Catherine into an internal panic that\u2019s decidedly at odds with the veneer of normalcy she puts on for Robert and their emotionally distant son Nicholas (Kodi Smit-McPhee). And after picking up on a change in his wife, Robert can\u2019t help but feel fear and confusion of his own when he starts receiving risque photos of her from Stephen in the mail.\n\nViewed through one lens, Disclaimer reads as a psychological drama about an elderly stalker terrorizing a woman as a way to deal with the grief of losing his family. That\u2019s the story Disclaimer presents as it zooms in on Stephen\u2019s life in the present where he reminisces about his son and late wife Nancy (Lesley Manville). But Cuar\u00f3n paints an increasingly complicated picture of what\u2019s truly going on with each of the show\u2019s beatific flashbacks to the sundrenched summer Catherine has tried to put behind her.\n\nDisclaimer leaves you to differentiate between fact and fiction as it hops between timelines to carefully illustrate how people\u2019s perceptions of reality are shaped by stories they tell themselves. There\u2019s never any question that Catherine is hiding secrets that Robert wants to hurt her with, but Cuar\u00f3n invites you to consider how a book like \u201cThe Perfect Stranger\u201d \u2014 one full of such closely guarded information \u2014 could have been written by someone who wasn\u2019t there when it all went down. It\u2019s an obvious question that feels like the sort of thing someone might bring up immediately in the face of having their lives turned upside down by a surprise expos\u00e9. But Cuar\u00f3n dramatizes the book\u2019s scandalous contents in a way that, when coupled with the show\u2019s utterly gorgeous cinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki and Bruno Delbonnel, emphasizes the power stories have to influence the way we understand other people.\n\nImage: Apple\n\nKline and Manville both shine with tragically wrenching performances that sell the all-consuming hopelessness Jonathan\u2019s death brought into the Brigstockes\u2019 lives. But Disclaimer truly revolves around Blanchett and George, whose two iterations of Catherine feel subtly distinct at first blush, yet uncannily similar as the series\u2019 seven episodes unfold. You\u2019re meant to wonder how much of the gap between present-day Catherine\u2019s steeliness and her past self\u2019s ethereal airiness is just a function of time changing people or whether that difference speaks to something more sinister that she\u2019s desperately trying to keep hidden.\n\nThe largeness with which sex looms in Disclaimer\u2019s story makes the show feel distinct among Apple TV Plus\u2019 other recent offerings. But rather than existing just to titillate you, Cuar\u00f3n uses the show\u2019s erotic edge to make a point about the danger of becoming fixated on the intimate details of other people\u2019s lives. You\u2019re supposed to gawk at Jonathan and Cather\u2019s dalliances in the past the same way everyone who comes into possession of \u201cThe Perfect Stranger\u201d finds themselves poring over the book\u2019s contents.\n\nConclusions are meant to be drawn from the way Disclaimer shows you who Catherine and Jonathan were to each other because Cuar\u00f3n is trying to get you, like his characters, to build a story about them in your mind. But by the series\u2019 final episode, Disclaimer\u2019s drama metamorphizes in a way that\u2019s designed to leave you reeling and thinking about how malleable the truth can really be.",

        "text": "Casio has opened preorders for its robotic pet called Moflin that looks like a cross between a hamster and Star Trek\u2019s Tribbles. Unlike Sony\u2019s robot dog Aibo that can follow you around, Moflin is designed to be held and cuddled, and over time, Casio says it will learn who you are and attempt to develop a simulated bond expressed through unique sounds and movements.\n\nOriginally developed through a collaboration with a Japanese startup called Vanguard Industries, Moflin is now being manufactured and distributed by Casio. It can be preordered for \uffe559,400 (around $398 USD) and is expected to be available starting on November 7th. Casio is also offering an optional subscription service called Club Moflin for \uffe56,600 (about $44 USD) per year, which gets you a discount on repairs, cleanings, and even a complete fur replacement. Accidents happen.\n\nDespite limited movements, Moflin looks very lifelike. Image: Casio\n\nCasio\u2019s Moflin isn\u2019t designed to be a play toy like Sony\u2019s Aibo. It\u2019s intended to be more of a comforting companion and potentially a tool to help improve your mental wellness, similar to Qoobo, the headless robotic cat. While being held, Moflin\u2019s limited head and body movements are supposed to make it feel like the furry robot is attempting to snuggle with you, and as with many devices debuting this year, there are some AI-powered features, too.\n\nMoflin is supposed to learn to recognize the person who interacts with it the most through their voice and the way they handle the bot, and it will respond with unique sounds and movements only expressed to that person to simulate a close bond.\n\nMoflin is available with either brown or gray fur, and Casio does offer a cleaning service for a fee. Image: Casio\n\nThe robot is also designed to develop its own simulated feelings and personality, which can change over time. With regular interactions, it will become happy, secure, and calm. If it\u2019s ignored, it can become stressed, anxious, and sad. But given the robot\u2019s limited emotive capabilities, it doesn\u2019t make sad sounds, or display an anxious wiggle, demonstrating those feelings. Its emotional state can only be determined through an app, making it feel almost like a very expensive Tamagotchi, minus any digital rewards for being a diligent caregiver. The app can also be used to turn down the volume of the sounds the robot makes.\n\nMoflin comes with its own bed for charging. Image: Casio",

Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\n\nA whole new, even smaller Mac Mini\n\nWe\u2019re expecting a big redesign of Apple\u2019s smallest desktop computer \u2014 likely to make it even smaller. In addition to including new M4 and M4 Pro chips, the new Mac Mini is rumored to shed its USB-A ports and be about as tiny as an Apple TV streaming box. It would be the first major redesign to come to the Mini in about 14 years (longer than The Verge has even been around).\n\nThe current Mac Mini with M2 and M2 Pro chips has been with us since the early days of 2023, so a new model does feel timely. A few of us here are Mac Mini stans, in part because it offers a great value proposition for its performance \u2014 at least, if you already have a monitor, keyboard, and mouse.\n\nI\u2019m excited to see what a refreshed Mini could look like and just how much an M4 Pro model leapfrogs the current M2 Pro, but potentially having fewer ports gives me pause. It also sounds unlikely that a smaller Mini will have the one thing I\u2019ve really wanted in mine: a speedy built-in SD card slot like the Mac Studio.\n\nThe colorful iMacs are currently on the M3 generation. Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge\n\nThe iMac gets a new chip \u2014 and maybe some USB-C accessories\n\nThe iMac has been on autopilot ever since the machine received its colorful glow-up in 2021. If the October event brings changes to Apple\u2019s all-in-one computer, it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll just see a bump from last year\u2019s M3 model to a fresh M4 version.\n\nThe real highlight may be refreshed versions of Apple\u2019s Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Keyboard that use USB-C instead of Lightning. They\u2019re among the final Apple devices to still use the Lightning port and feel sorely out of place now that the iPhone has switched over (and as the EU\u2019s deadline to move to USB-C creeps closer).\n\nI\u2019m still holding out hope for a bigger iMac refresh sometime down the road. Somebody wake me when we finally get the long-rumored 32-inch iMac or a resurrection of the iMac Pro.\n\nThe current iPad Mini is from 2021. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\n\nThe iPad Mini gets an overdue update\n\nIf Apple has any updated tablets in store, the model most due for some changes is the iPad Mini. The current 8.3-inch iPad Mini came out back in 2021, running the A15 Bionic processor we first saw with the iPhone 13 generation. Perhaps it\u2019s time for pilots everywhere to rejoice as the tiniest iPad steps up to an M-series chip? Rumors suggest a refresh is coming \u2014 the question is whether the Mini steps up to the big leagues with the M4 or gets relegated to the still-kicking M2 like the latest iPad Air. Either way, anything is better than what happened to the mini iPhones.\n\nThere are also rumblings that Apple could update the entry-level 10.9-inch iPad to a new 11th-gen model, but it\u2019s not clear if this update is in the cards for this month or sometime early next year. The current 10th-gen model launched at a pricey $449, but Apple course-corrected by slashing its starting price to $349 earlier this year. An 11th-gen model will likely look very similar, though it might be an opportunity for Apple to clean up and update its messy accessories situation.\n\nThe current Mac Studio is from 2023 and on the M2 generation. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nWhat else might pop up?\n\nThe M4 processor debuted five months ago in the latest iPad Pros, and as mentioned above, Apple is expected to announce its latest chips are finally making the jump to most Macs in the coming weeks.",

But as the antitrust fight against the company continues, and Google\u2019s losses mount, it\u2019s also starting to seem like Google as we know also won\u2019t be around forever. In one case, the Play Store is being opened up; in another, the government says it might try to force Chrome and Android out of Google.\n\nOn this episode of The Vergecast, The Verge\u2019s Lauren Feiner takes us through all the latest movements in the many cases against Google, and what she\u2019s hearing about how the government and the company are preparing for the future.\n\nBut before we get to that, we do some wild Tesla speculating. Because you\u2019ve now seen the Cybercab reveal, and so have we, but when we recorded this show on Thursday afternoon all we had was years of teases and some educated guesses about what might be coming. Nilay and David both have some predictions, and you can score us now that we know the truth. (Unfortunately, it appears Nilay won.)\n\nWe also have lots of gadget news to discuss, from Nintendo\u2019s adorable and slightly confusing new Alarmo alarm clock to the latest reports on Apple\u2019s next iPads and Macs. We\u2019re nearing the end of gadget-launch season, as we wind toward the holidays, but it appears we\u2019re not done yet.\n\nFinally, we do a lightning round, in which we have big plans for Google Docs tabs, serious worries about the state of content moderation in this year\u2019s hurricane season, and a lot of questions about why you\u2019d need an AI avatar on Zoom.\n\nIf you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, here are some links to get you started, first on Tesla:\n\nAnd on the week\u2019s gadget news:\n\nAnd in Google antitrust news:",

Projects can also be broken down into new \u201cCollections\u201d folders that automatically update to reflect any changes or comments made to work, creating a smoother collaboration process for teams or multiple users.\n\nThis is what some of the new Collections and tagging features look like in Frame.io V4. Image: Adobe\n\nAdobe says that V4 overhauls every part of Frame.io to make it \u201cfaster, more performant, and more intuitive.\u201d For example, the platforms\u2019 streaming player has been updated to minimize buffering and interruptions, and provides \u201cframe-accurate hover and high-resolution preview\u201d features to improve the clarity of footage.\n\nFrame.io\u2019s Camera to Cloud (C2C) capabilities have been updated to support direct integration with Adobe Lightroom. All images uploaded via C2C on Frame.io can now be automatically transferred to a user\u2019s connected Lightroom account, allowing them to be reviewed and selected for editing in real time without uploading the images to multiple platforms.",

        "text": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk surprised attendees of the \u201cWe, Robot\u201d event by presenting a new, unexpected vehicle: a passenger van.\n\nOf course, it was far from a conventional van. The Tesla Robovan (Musk pronounces it ruh-BO-vehn) looked like something out of an Art Deco fever dream, with a sleek train engine-like shape and no visible wheels. Musk said that the vehicle could carry up to 20 people or be used to transport goods.\n\n\u201cThe Robovan is what\u2019s gonna solve for high density,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you want to take a sports team somewhere, or you\u2019re looking to really get the cost of travel down to, I don\u2019t know, 5-10, cents a mile, then you can use the robovan.\u201d\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 14 Previous Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 14\n\nThe Robovan is intended for the company\u2019s Tesla Network, an autonomous ridehailing service for purpose-built self-driving cars, as well as Tesla customers\u2019 personally owned vehicles.\n\nTesla has dropped hints about a van before. In its Master Plan Part Deux, the company said it was developing \u201chigh passenger-density urban transport\u201d and also suggested that autonomous buses could be deployed. And earlier this year, Musk showed an image of a cloaked van-shaped vehicle as part of the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting.\n\nGiven Musk\u2019s notorious disdain for public transportation, it seemed unlikely that he would commit resources to anything like a van. But in Master Plan Part 3, the company lists \u201cbus\u201d and \u201ccommercial/passenger vans\u201d as \u201cTBD.\u201d\n\nThe electric van space is heating up, with the recent releases of the Volkswagen ID Buzz and Mercedes eSprinter. In the commercial segment, there\u2019s also the Ram ProMaster EV, Ford E-Transit, and BrightDrop Zevo.",

You\u2019ll often see staffers posting on social media platforms like Instagram and X to announce updates and reach a larger audience, so this feels new. The Biden administration\u2019s \u201cwhitehouse\u201d account has new posts in subreddits r/NorthCarolina and r/Georgia to discuss the federal response to Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton.\n\n\u201cYep, it\u2019s really us!\u201d the White House account says in one of the threads.

        "title": "Garmin Fenix 8 review: only kind of smart",
        "text": "There used to be a clear divide between smartwatches and multisport watches. On one side, you had Apple Watches, Fitbits, and Galaxy Watches, with their snazzy screens, voice assistants, and third-party apps. On the other, you had Garmin, with its rugged watches, killer tracking, and great battery life.\n\nThat line has gotten a lot blurrier in the past few years. The Apple Watch Ultra and Galaxy Watch Ultra have taken several pages from Garmin\u2019s playbook. And now, with the $999.99 Fenix 8, Garmin is striking back. If its rivals want to add fitness features, well, Garmin\u2019s just going to make the Fenix 8 smarter.\n\n7 Verge Score Garmin Fenix 8 $ 999.99 The Good Smartens up Garmin\u2019s flagship multisport watch\n\nExcellent battery and fitness tracking\n\nOffers MIP and OLED display options\n\nCondenses the Fenix and Epix lines into one The Bad The starting price is $350 more than the Fenix 7!\n\nSmart features are less helpful without LTE $1000 at Amazon How we rate and review products\n\nThe big additions to the Fenix 8 are a speaker and microphone. They mean you can now interact with the watch in more ways than fitness tracking and training. You can take calls from the wrist, use an on-device voice assistant for setting timers and starting activities, and connect to your phone\u2019s built-in assistant for more complex queries. If you can convince your loved ones to download the new Garmin Messenger app, replying to messages on the wrist has also gotten easier.\n\nTheoretically, these are all good updates. In practice, it means the Fenix 8 doesn\u2019t play to Garmin\u2019s strengths.\n\nKinda smart\n\nThe Fenix 8 is the top dog in Garmin\u2019s extensive smartwatch lineup. While it\u2019s not as chunky as older Fenix models, it\u2019s not meant to be a sleek lifestyle watch like the Venu series or sporty, lightweight option like the Forerunner. There\u2019s gravitas to its design. It\u2019s the premium choice for serious athletes who want everything Garmin can throw at them \u2014 and that\u2019s why Garmin is bringing a lot of these smart features to the Fenix 8.\n\nThe bulk of the \u201csmart\u201d updates zero in on the addition of the microphone and speaker \u2014 namely, voice assistants and calling from the wrist. But there\u2019s a big factor holding back the Fenix 8\u2019s smart features: the lack of LTE.\n\nGarmin Fenix 8 Specs Material: stainless steel or titanium, Gorilla Glass or sapphire crystal\n\nDisplay: memory-in-pixel or OLED\n\nConnectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth\n\nSizes: MIP watches: 47mm, 51mm; OLED watches: 43mm, 47mm, 51mm\n\nWeight: 43mm: 66g stainless steel, 60g titanium; 47mm: 80g stainless steel, 73g titanium; 51mm: 102g stainless steel, 92g titanium\n\n66g stainless steel, 60g titanium; 80g stainless steel, 73g titanium; 102g stainless steel, 92g titanium Battery life: 43mm: up to 10 days, four days w/ AOD; 47mm: up to 16 days, seven days w/ AOD for OLED and up to 21 days for MIP with 28 days solar charging; 51mm: up to 29 days, 13 w/ AOD for OLED and 30 days for MIP w/ 48 with solar charging\n\nup to 10 days, four days w/ AOD; up to 16 days, seven days w/ AOD for OLED and up to 21 days for MIP with 28 days solar charging; up to 29 days, 13 w/ AOD for OLED and 30 days for MIP w/ 48 with solar charging Sensors: optical heart rate sensor, EKG, blood oxygen sensor, gyroscope, compass, accelerometer, thermometer, ambient light sensor, depth sensor,\n\nGPS: dual-frequency GPS\n\nWater resistance: 10ATM\n\nNFC: yes\n\nCompatibility: iPhone and Android\n\nYes, you can make and receive calls with the Fenix 8\u2026 so long as your phone is within Bluetooth range. Yes, you can talk to a voice assistant\u2026 but it\u2019s limited unless your phone is nearby. Yes, you can reply to texts, but\u2026 you get my drift. If you get a cellular Apple Watch, Galaxy Watch, or Pixel Watch, you can leave your phone at home. That\u2019s not really an option with the Fenix 8.\n\nThe friction is particularly noticeable with the on-device voice assistant. The assistant works pretty well, but it\u2019s mostly limited to commands that don\u2019t require an internet connection. You can start activities, set timers, and tweak settings. (It can tell you the weather, provided it\u2019s loaded the day\u2019s weather from Wi-Fi or\u2026 your phone via Bluetooth.) But say you want to send a text message. This nameless assistant can\u2019t do that. Instead, you\u2019ll have to scroll to a different menu and launch your phone\u2019s assistant. It\u2019s good to have that option, but at that point, you\u2019re probably just going to whip out your phone anyway.\n\nPart of the problem is that Garmin has always been staunchly platform-agnostic. I happen to think that\u2019s a good thing, but the price you pay is never having your watch work quite as seamlessly with your phone. For example, it\u2019s great that you can dictate voice memos now, but their usefulness is limited because there\u2019s no easy way to get them off your wrist and onto another device. That\u2019s unlike the Pixel Watch 3, where I can just record something, and boom, it\u2019s magically on my Pixel 8 Pro.\n\nShortly after this text, she asked if she could delete the Garmin Messenger app. Screenshot: Garmin Messenger app\n\nAnother prime example is the new Garmin Messenger. Ostensibly, this is to help iOS Garmin users reply more easily to messages on the wrist. (Android users have always been able to send quick replies to texts, but Apple gon\u2019 Apple.) Good luck convincing friends and family to download yet another chat app so you can reply to messages on your Fenix 8! I roped one friend into it. It worked, but it was kind of a hassle to use: you can\u2019t dictate messages, the canned responses are limited, and for some reason, Garmin thought bringing back a T9 keyboard was a good idea. At the end of the test, I asked my friend if she\u2019d ever use the Garmin Messenger app to reach me. Her words: \u201cOnly if I had to.\u201d Followed by \u201cAlso, can I delete the app now?\u201d\n\nA good chunk of this smart feature awkwardness would be solved with a cellular option \u2014 and it\u2019d enhance Garmin\u2019s existing safety tools, too. But there\u2019s a reason most third-party smartwatch makers don\u2019t offer LTE options: dealing with carriers is a pain. It took Fossil ages to offer an LTE option, and even then, it only ever managed a single carrier before quitting smartwatches entirely. Garmin has LTE options for its Forerunner 945 watch and its Bounce kids tracker, but those require a separate Garmin subscription and are limited to safety features.\n\nBlessed consolidation\n\nI\u2019ve often criticized Garmin for making way too many smartwatches. The Fenix 8 thankfully makes things simpler at the top end by combining the Fenix and Epix lineups.\n\nLike Garmin\u2019s on-device assistant, I, too, sometimes crash while processing requests.\n\nThe second-gen Epix, introduced in 2022, was essentially a Fenix with an OLED display. The problem was that Garmin then had two premium watches that were very similar. The main difference was the memory-in-pixel (MIP) display on the Fenix and the OLED display on the Epix Pro. The MIP version gets better battery life, whereas OLED offers much better visibility indoors. It\u2019s a clear choice for ultra-athletes but confusing for everyone else.\n\nNow, you can just choose between an MIP or OLED Fenix 8. It\u2019d be perfect if not for just one baby beef: petite-wristed folks don\u2019t get to pick anything other than the OLED display.\n\nThe MIP Fenix 8 only comes in 47mm and 51mm sizes. In principle, I\u2019m annoyed for the small-wristed athlete who wants an MIP display. But the reality is the battery bump from an MIP display isn\u2019t quite as impressive on the smaller watches. I got nine to 11 days on last year\u2019s 42mm Fenix 7S Pro. This year, I got eight to nine days on the OLED 43mm Fenix 8 with the always-on display turned off. (That dwindles to about four days with it on.) I still think you should give people the option, but I also understand why Garmin didn\u2019t. For what it\u2019s worth, I tested the OLED, and that\u2019s what I\u2019d recommend if you want good indoor visibility. If you\u2019re trekking out in a lot of harsh, direct sunlight, MIP is the way to go.\n\nEven with that quibble, consolidating with the Fenix 8 was a refreshing and welcome change. I\u2019d love to see Garmin streamline some of its other smartwatch lineups. I don\u2019t know that it will, as Garmin rarely passes up a chance to do more, but one can hope.\n\nNobody likes a price hike\n\nIt\u2019s a shame. Despite the upgrades, the Fenix 8 is only sort of better at being a smartwatch. It\u2019s still an excellent training watch, and its battery far outlasts both Apple and Samsung\u2019s Ultras. But I\u2019m simply not convinced anyone\u2019s going to ditch either one for a Fenix just because they can now interact with a voice assistant or make calls from the wrist.\n\nEveryone I\u2019ve ever met with a Fenix watch has been a triathlete, ultramarathoner, or someone who casually qualifies for the Boston Marathon with a sub-three-hour marathon time. These folks pick something like the Fenix because they need a tracker with mondo battery life, stellar GPS accuracy, in-depth training programs, and maps for traversing trails. Those are the features that people would leave Apple or Samsung for \u2014 and they don\u2019t get a major upgrade with the Fenix 8.\n\nAdding a speaker and a mic lets you take phone calls. But sensor-wise, you\u2019re not getting an upgrade over last year\u2019s Fenix 7 Pro or Epix Pro.\n\nTo make matters worse, I almost choked when I saw the Fenix 8\u2019s starting price was a whole $350 more than the Fenix 7. That\u2019s not a $50 to $100 hike where you grumble and then begrudgingly admit that inflation is a bitch. For $999, you could buy a laptop. Hell, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is $800, while the Galaxy Watch Ultra is $650. And those do come with LTE. If you\u2019re determined to get a Garmin, there are literally dozens of cheaper options. (Might I suggest the $450 Forerunner 265 or a discounted Fenix 7 Pro or Epix Pro?)\n\nIt\u2019s frustrating because Garmin is right to shore up its smart features. There\u2019s not much to improve on the fitness front, so making its watches more useful outside of training makes a lot of sense. It\u2019s also crystal clear that Garmin has some catching up to do, and progress isn\u2019t going to happen overnight. The Fenix 8 might be on the right track, but it doesn\u2019t quite nail the price or execution.",

She\u2019s a reviews editor here at The Verge and also does a ton of work on how-tos and roundups and helping tell everyone about all the best technology everywhere. (She recently turned me back onto UpNote, just to name one \u2014 and she\u2019s right, it\u2019s delightful.)\n\nSo Barbara tries everything, but what does she actually use? I asked her to share her homescreen to find out. Here it is, plus some info on the apps she uses and why:\n\nThe phone: It\u2019s a Pixel 6. I know this may go against the tech enthusiast philosophy of \u201cthe latest and greatest,\u201d but I tend to hold on to my phones as long as they work (or break \u2014 I\u2019ve been known to drop one or two). I believe that Android 15 will be its last OS update, so I\u2019ll probably have to bite the bullet and get a new phone next year when Android 16 shows up.\n\nThe wallpaper: This is a photo I took last year in Owego, New York, where a very close friend grew up. It\u2019s the Susquehanna River at sunset.\n\nThe apps: Maps, Contacts, Google Voice, Slack, Chrome, Google Home, Google Photos, Google Drive, Files, Google Play Store, Phone, Messages, Gmail, Camera, Assistant.\n\nThe icon labeled \u201cLISTEN\u201d goes to a webpage with a recording of Bob Fosse directing Liza Minnelli in the original Broadway production of Chicago, which gives you some idea of the kind of theater nerd I am.\n\nThe second screen has all the other apps that I use on a day-to-day basis, divided into groups. (Or used to use \u2014 there are some there that I haven\u2019t opened for a long time and really need to delete.) The Tody app was supposed to motivate me to clean my home, but unfortunately, it hasn\u2019t worked as well as I\u2019d hoped. Smart Tools is a bunch of handy apps (like a mirror, a ruler, and a distance calculator) in one neat package.\n\nI\u2019ve got one more screen that has apps I\u2019m currently experimenting with, but that can change on a day-to-day basis, so I don\u2019t think it counts.\n\nI also asked Barbara to share a few things she\u2019s into right now.

It\u2019s a really fun and immediate way of making music compared to a traditional DAW.

My favorite feature is Fog of World, which keeps track of where you have and haven\u2019t \u2018discovered\u2019 in the world, similar to discovering locations in games like Fortnite but in the real world. Outside of that, it\u2019s got some really cool Perplexity / ChatGPT-like search capabilities for finding places near you, e.g., \u2018What are some coffee shops nearby that have free Wi-Fi?\u2019 or \u2018What are some dog-friendly parks I can visit in Sydney?\u2019\u201d \u2013 Harry\n\n\u201cThe new 3-in-1 Ninja Luxe espresso machine has been keeping me overcaffeinated. Weight-based dosing ensures your beans are consistently ground, it evaluates the shots you pull to recommend changes to grind size, and the automated frother makes it easy to get right, too. Great for someone like me who cares about their coffee but isn\u2019t overly fussy about it.\u201d \u2013 Scott\n\n\u201cI was looking for a good idle / incremental game to play in down moments, and Idle Iktah has totally fit the bill. I can enjoy mobile games a bit too much sometimes and have to be cautious about getting caught in addictive gameplay loops. Iktah is right in the sweet spot of engaging but not consuming, with charming PNW-inspired pixel art.\u201d \u2013 Emmett\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s native apps have gotten good enough to be your main productivity stack. Forever Notes is an elegant and fresh look at configuring Apple Notes as a sophisticated note program.

I\u2019ve avoided Excel, Google Sheets, and anything else that looks like rows and columns for as long as I can remember, but over the course of this year, I\u2019ve worked on an unusual number of big team projects \u2014 the sort that require a lot of people to know what\u2019s going on at any given time \u2014 and man, you just can\u2019t beat the efficiency of a good spreadsheet. I\u2019m barely scratching the surface, features-wise, but I\u2019m hooked on how easy it is to build a calendar, a project tracker, or just a good ol\u2019 budget system in a spreadsheet. Who needs awesome optimized apps! Give me rows and columns! I hate that I\u2019ve become this person, but I fear there\u2019s no going back.\n\nAlso, and I mean this: Send me your awesome-est spreadsheet tips. I am going to be unstoppable.",

        "title": "Ethics Statement",
        "text": "Since it launched in 2011, The Verge has operated under a strict ethics policy that ensures our editorial independence and the integrity of our journalism. All of our editorial staff are required to abide by the following guidelines, many of which exceed standards in our industry.\n\nEarning and keeping the trust of our audience is, and always will be, at the core of The Verge\u2019s mission. In a world where information is distributed across countless platforms and formats, it\u2019s more important than ever to promote clear ethical guidelines that allow audiences to know where that information comes from and whether it can be trusted.\n\nAs a part of Vox Media, The Verge also adheres to the Vox Media Editorial Ethics & Guidelines.\n\nEditorial independence\n\nOur most valuable asset is the independence that allows us to publish stories without fear.\n\nThe Verge is routinely critical of people and companies we cover, and we\u2019re most proud of our work when we tell stories that people in power would prefer not see the light of day. We are able to enjoy this independence because every member of our editorial team is required to follow a strict code of conduct. Additionally, we enforce a strict wall between The Verge\u2019s editorial team and our parent company\u2019s advertising teams (addressed more in detail below).\n\nHere are the core guidelines in our code of conduct:\n\nWe don\u2019t accept things of value from companies or from their PR firms, period\n\nWe do not accept preconditions for coverage of a story that require us to say certain things\n\nWe do not give subjects of our reporting the ability to preview or approve interview questions, nor do we allow them to review our stories before we publish\n\nWe do not allow reporters to cover people or companies where they have a personal conflict\n\nWe do not make paid endorsements of any kind\n\nWe do not personally invest in companies we cover\n\nOur editorial team does not produce paid content, ever\n\nOur policy against receiving anything of value from companies we cover includes, but is not limited to, things like gifts, meals, discounted services, or paid trips and junkets. Vox Media and The Verge pay for all travel expenses to all events, including transportation, food, and hotels.\n\nProfessional conduct\n\nIn addition to standards that preserve our independence, The Verge\u2019s reporters are expected to abide by industry-standard ethical guidelines for reporting. This means that our editorial team takes great care to learn the truth and report it, protect sources, minimize risk of harm, and strive for accuracy and honesty in everything we publish. We use the Society of Professional Journalists\u2019 code of ethics as a baseline for the professional conduct of our editorial staff.\n\nSourcing Standards at The Verge\n\nThe Verge maintains high standards for sourcing. Our reporters will always carefully explain our sourcing practices to you and strive to protect your confidentiality when appropriate.\n\nIf you are a communications professional, or talking to us in your official capacity, we will abide by the following definitions.\n\nON THE RECORD\n\n\u201cOn the record\u201d is the default for talking to reporters and editors at The Verge. You say things, we record them, we can report who you are and quote what you said. We will expect corporate communications professionals and people speaking to us in an official capacity to be on the record in almost every single case, and you will have to tell us why you want to change this default every single time.\n\nON BACKGROUND\n\n\u201cOn background\u201d means you can talk to us and we will not specifically identify you, instead using a descriptor like \u201ccompany spokesperson.\u201d If you are a corporate communications professional speaking to us in your official capacity, we will not in any circumstances attribute you as \u201ca source familiar.\u201d\n\nGoing \u201con background\u201d is an agreement between you and the reporters or editors you speak to at The Verge. The general rules of an agreement apply: you may offer to go on background, and we will accept or deny your request. If we do not specifically accept, there is no agreement.\n\nThis means:\n\nYou cannot email Verge reporters statements prefaced with \u201cOn background\u201d and assume we will treat the material as if it is on background. You cannot tell us how a statement is to be attributed without asking. You cannot say things like \u201cbackground not for attribution,\u201d and we will not agree to that terminology. This is just off the record. Say what you mean.\n\nA reminder: you have to ask, and we have to agree. Every single time.\n\nOFF THE RECORD\n\n\u201cOff the record\u201d is simple: you talk to us, we agree not to use anything we hear in any of our reporting unless we can source it otherwise. Like background, off the record is an agreement. If we don\u2019t agree, you are not off the record.\n\nWe do not readily agree to off-the-record conversations with corporate communications professionals or people speaking in their official capacities without specific reasons.\n\nAdvertising\n\nVox Media employs a dedicated advertising team that is responsible for selling advertising space on our properties. Any feature on a Vox Media brand sponsored by a particular company or advertiser that is developed independently by the Vox Creative and Sales teams is clearly marked as \"Advertiser Content.\" Advertisements do not necessarily reflect the views of Vox Media or our editorial teams. Vox Creative and Sales teams have their own set of guidelines and policies for developing content and do not infringe on the creative agency of editorial teams.\n\nOur editorial teams do not directly accept money or other consideration from individuals or entities as a condition or incentive to write a review or story, whether favorable or unfavorable. However, some of our editorial content is made possible through the support of sponsors. This content is clearly marked as content \"Presented\" by the applicable sponsor. Our sponsors may select which content they wish to support, however, we do not allow our Sales teams, Vox Creative, or our sponsors to control or interfere with the editorial integrity of our editorial teams and the content they create.\n\nSome of our content may contain marketing links, which means we will receive a commission for purchases made via those links. In our editorial content, these affiliate links appear automatically, and our editorial teams are not influenced by our affiliate partnerships. Vox Media does employ a commerce team to optimize certain content for affiliate revenue, and such content is marked as such by including a similar affiliate links disclosure. We work with several providers (currently Skimlinks and Rakuten Marketing) to manage our affiliate relationships. You can find out more about their services by visiting their sites.\n\nDistributed platforms\n\nThe Verge is a multimedia brand that is distributed across many platforms, including our own site on the web, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and others. Our editorial standards apply to all of our platforms.\n\nVox Creative does, on occasion, distribute sponsored editorial content and paid branded content through our distributed platforms. They are clearly labeled as \"Presented by\" (for editorial sponsorships) or \"Paid Content\" (for branded content) in the post and further labeled using platform-specific tools such as the Facebook handshake.\n\nCorrections and updates\n\nDespite making every effort to be accurate in our reporting, sometimes we get something wrong. If we discover a mistake in a story, our editors will promptly issue a correction that removes the inaccurate information and adds a notice of correction that explains the error. In some cases, like if an inaccuracy is contained in a video, we may have to remove the original piece of content and replace it with a version in which the error is omitted.\n\nSometimes more information about a story we\u2019ve published becomes available that either continues the narrative or clarifies the original story, but it is not a correction. In these cases, we may add and / or change elements of the original story. These updates will be clearly noted at the bottom of the story, indicating the time of the change and a note describing what was changed.\n\nAdditionally, we may remove content if we believe it infringes on the intellectual property rights of a third party, otherwise violates any third-party rights, or breaches any applicable law or regulation. These decisions are made in concert with Vox Media\u2019s legal team.\n\nReviews\n\nAdvising our audience about the best way to spend their time and money is one of our most important responsibilities. Our reviews always contain the honest, independent assessments of our editorial team. Like everything else we publish, there are no paid-for reviews of any kind written by The Verge editorial team.\n\nCompanies may loan products (like laptops and smartphones) to our editors for a limited period of time so we can evaluate them and determine whether to review them. Occasionally, we will keep a review unit for an extended period of time to fully evaluate it and its software updates over time. We may also agree to an \"embargo\" with a company or PR firm that allows us to evaluate their product prior to its release.\n\nPersonal investing\n\nWe do not invest in companies we cover, and employees are forbidden from trading or buying stock in companies we cover or companies in the general technology sector. Vox Media\u2019s retirement savings programs may hold some of these restricted stocks, but these funds are not managed directly by employees.\n\nAdditionally, our employees are forbidden from owning or trading in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.\n\nOther employment\n\nEmployees of The Verge may not be otherwise employed by or receive compensation from companies that they are likely to cover, nor are they permitted to have any advisory role (paid or unpaid) at those companies. In general, writers and editors of The Verge are not allowed to conduct journalism for other publications without the express permission of the editor-in-chief.\n\nGiveaways\n\nFrom time to time, The Verge or Vox Media will conduct contests and giveaways for our audiences. We will post rules for each contest and giveaway, which will be binding to individuals who decide to participate. While giveaways or contests may be sponsored by an advertiser or partner, they are not and should never be considered endorsements of the entities involved or their products.\n\nVox Media investors\n\nVox Media has a number of investors, including, but not limited to, Accel Partners, Khosla Ventures, General Atlantic, Comcast Ventures, and NBCUniversal. A full list of our investors can be found here.\n\nWhen our content touches on investor products, services our investors provide, compete with, or invest in, our content is created with total editorial independence from these investors. None of our investors have influence on the content we publish or access to our editorial and publication process unless we have an agreement with an investor that specifically contemplates a content creation partnership. If such a partnership exists, then this would be clearly disclosed to the Vox Media audience. We will also remind audiences of our relationship with major investors when we write directly about the business or other activities of such investors.\n\nPartnerships\n\nFrom time to time, Vox Media\u2019s Partnerships team engages with other businesses, brands, and organizations whose activities resonate with the company as a whole, or with one or more of our editorial teams. These partnerships do not impact the content that our editorial teams independently publish. Our Partnerships team, however, may create content as part of these partnerships, and we may publish this content on our editorial sites. In these cases, we will include a disclosure to describe the nature of the relationship between our editorial brand(s) and the partner(s) and the extent to which our editorial teams were involved in the creation of the content\n\nFeedback\n\nWe\u2019re always interested in hearing from you if you have a concern about our ethical standards. If you see something that doesn\u2019t look right on The Verge, please let us know.",

        "title": "Casio made a furry robot designed to cuddle and calm you down",
        "text": "Casio has opened preorders for its robotic pet called Moflin that looks like a cross between a hamster and Star Trek\u2019s Tribbles. Unlike Sony\u2019s robot dog Aibo that can follow you around, Moflin is designed to be held and cuddled, and over time, Casio says it will learn who you are and attempt to develop a simulated bond expressed through unique sounds and movements.\n\nOriginally developed through a collaboration with a Japanese startup called Vanguard Industries, Moflin is now being manufactured and distributed by Casio. It can be preordered for \uffe559,400 (around $398 USD) and is expected to be available starting on November 7th. Casio is also offering an optional subscription service called Club Moflin for \uffe56,600 (about $44 USD) per year, which gets you a discount on repairs, cleanings, and even a complete fur replacement. Accidents happen.\n\nDespite limited movements, Moflin looks very lifelike. Image: Casio\n\nCasio\u2019s Moflin isn\u2019t designed to be a play toy like Sony\u2019s Aibo. It\u2019s intended to be more of a comforting companion and potentially a tool to help improve your mental wellness, similar to Qoobo, the headless robotic cat. While being held, Moflin\u2019s limited head and body movements are supposed to make it feel like the furry robot is attempting to snuggle with you, and as with many devices debuting this year, there are some AI-powered features, too.\n\nMoflin is supposed to learn to recognize the person who interacts with it the most through their voice and the way they handle the bot, and it will respond with unique sounds and movements only expressed to that person to simulate a close bond.\n\nMoflin is available with either brown or gray fur, and Casio does offer a cleaning service for a fee. Image: Casio\n\nThe robot is also designed to develop its own simulated feelings and personality, which can change over time. With regular interactions, it will become happy, secure, and calm. If it\u2019s ignored, it can become stressed, anxious, and sad. But given the robot\u2019s limited emotive capabilities, it doesn\u2019t make sad sounds, or display an anxious wiggle, demonstrating those feelings. Its emotional state can only be determined through an app, making it feel almost like a very expensive Tamagotchi, minus any digital rewards for being a diligent caregiver. The app can also be used to turn down the volume of the sounds the robot makes.\n\nMoflin comes with its own bed for charging. Image: Casio",

        "title": "What to expect from Apple\u2019s next Mac and iPad announcements",
        "text": "Another round of Apple devices is about to arrive. After launching the iPhone 16 lineup, new Apple Watches, and the AirPods 4 in September, Apple appears to be gearing up to introduce updated Macs and iPads sometime this month.\n\nWe\u2019re expecting a fresh round of chip upgrades, at least one redesign, and maybe an October surprise or two (the good kind). The official announcements might come to us via a traditional event or a series of early morning press releases \u2014 Apple has taken both approaches in the past, and nobody knows for certain right now. Regardless of how it happens, here\u2019s what we think we\u2019ll see get updates and what might not make the cut.\n\nImage: Apple\n\nApple Intelligence may finally (start to) launch\n\nApple Intelligence is set to launch \u201cthis fall\u201d across compatible iPhones, iPads, and Macs, with the first features arriving in October. That means we should be getting an announcement sometime soon.\n\nFirst up, we\u2019re expecting Apple\u2019s Writing Tools for rewriting, proofreading, and summarizing, plus a newly designed Siri, new Photos app features such as Clean Up (akin to Google\u2019s Magic Eraser), and live transcriptions of phone calls and voice memos. Other features like ChatGPT search integrations, Genmoji custom emoji, Image Playground generative art, and Visual Intelligence image searching are expected to \u201croll out later this year and in the months following,\u201d according to Apple.\n\nWe first saw these features demoed back at WWDC 2024, but so far, you\u2019ve had to install one of Apple\u2019s developer or public betas to experience them. For iPhones, the features are coming to the 15 Pro / Pro Max and the whole iPhone 16 line. On iPads and Macs, Apple Intelligence will launch on models with M1-generation processors or newer.\n\nThe 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nMacBook Pros with newer chips\n\nThe M2 Mac Mini could be the last with this long-running design. Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\n\nA whole new, even smaller Mac Mini\n\nWe\u2019re expecting a big redesign of Apple\u2019s smallest desktop computer \u2014 likely to make it even smaller. In addition to including new M4 and M4 Pro chips, the new Mac Mini is rumored to shed its USB-A ports and be about as tiny as an Apple TV streaming box. It would be the first major redesign to come to the Mini in about 14 years (longer than The Verge has even been around).\n\nThe current Mac Mini with M2 and M2 Pro chips has been with us since the early days of 2023, so a new model does feel timely. A few of us here are Mac Mini stans, in part because it offers a great value proposition for its performance \u2014 at least, if you already have a monitor, keyboard, and mouse.\n\nI\u2019m excited to see what a refreshed Mini could look like and just how much an M4 Pro model leapfrogs the current M2 Pro, but potentially having fewer ports gives me pause. It also sounds unlikely that a smaller Mini will have the one thing I\u2019ve really wanted in mine: a speedy built-in SD card slot like the Mac Studio.\n\nThe colorful iMacs are currently on the M3 generation. Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge\n\nThe iMac gets a new chip \u2014 and maybe some USB-C accessories\n\nThe iMac has been on autopilot ever since the machine received its colorful glow-up in 2021. If the October event brings changes to Apple\u2019s all-in-one computer, it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll just see a bump from last year\u2019s M3 model to a fresh M4 version.\n\nThe real highlight may be refreshed versions of Apple\u2019s Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Keyboard that use USB-C instead of Lightning. They\u2019re among the final Apple devices to still use the Lightning port and feel sorely out of place now that the iPhone has switched over (and as the EU\u2019s deadline to move to USB-C creeps closer).\n\nI\u2019m still holding out hope for a bigger iMac refresh sometime down the road. Somebody wake me when we finally get the long-rumored 32-inch iMac or a resurrection of the iMac Pro.\n\nThe current iPad Mini is from 2021. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\n\nThe iPad Mini gets an overdue update\n\nIf Apple has any updated tablets in store, the model most due for some changes is the iPad Mini. The current 8.3-inch iPad Mini came out back in 2021, running the A15 Bionic processor we first saw with the iPhone 13 generation. Perhaps it\u2019s time for pilots everywhere to rejoice as the tiniest iPad steps up to an M-series chip? Rumors suggest a refresh is coming \u2014 the question is whether the Mini steps up to the big leagues with the M4 or gets relegated to the still-kicking M2 like the latest iPad Air. Either way, anything is better than what happened to the mini iPhones.\n\nThere are also rumblings that Apple could update the entry-level 10.9-inch iPad to a new 11th-gen model, but it\u2019s not clear if this update is in the cards for this month or sometime early next year. The current 10th-gen model launched at a pricey $449, but Apple course-corrected by slashing its starting price to $349 earlier this year. An 11th-gen model will likely look very similar, though it might be an opportunity for Apple to clean up and update its messy accessories situation.\n\nThe current Mac Studio is from 2023 and on the M2 generation. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nWhat else might pop up?\n\nThe M4 processor debuted five months ago in the latest iPad Pros, and as mentioned above, Apple is expected to announce its latest chips are finally making the jump to most Macs in the coming weeks.",

        "title": "Marques Brownlee says \u2018we failed on the price\u2019 with Panels",
        "text": "Marques Brownlee published a video on Friday addressing the criticisms around Panels, his new wallpaper app, saying that he and the team \u201cfailed on the price front\u201d at launch. The app received an outpour of criticism from fans, both on the MKBHD YouTube channel and across social platforms. Discussing the app, Brownlee admitted it needed work. \u201cIf I was reviewing this app, I would not have been very nice,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the primary criticisms of the app was that the premium \u201cPanels Plus\u201d subscription cost $11.99 per month or $49.99 per year to remove ads and have full access to the available collections of wallpapers. To make things better, Brownlee and the team have been improving the free experience by getting rid of in-feed ads, making all wallpapers that aren\u2019t part of a collection available in 1080p for free with no ads, and letting people get a full-resolution wallpaper by watching one 30-second ad.\n\nAs for the subscription\u2019s price, \u201ceven though subscriptions are incredibly unpopular, we wanted to at least offer one that made sense for the wallpaper power user... for how few of you actually exist,\u201d Brownlee says. There\u2019s now a new, more affordable Panels Plus \u201cStandard\u201d tier that costs $1.99 per month with no ads on individual wallpapers. The higher \u201cUnlimited\u201d tier, which is still at that $11.99 per month / $49.99 per year price, adds full access to collections and early access to new wallpapers.\n\nScreenshots showing the different subscription tiers for the Panels Plus subscription. Images: Panels Wallpaper Mobile App; Collage: Jay Peters / The Verge\n\nBrownlee also touches on concerns about what the app was tracking based on the long list that had been included in the App Privacy section of the App Store. \u201cAnother blunder by us,\u201d Brownlee says. \u201cThis was way too broad.\u201d Brownlee says that the list actually was \u201ca list of things that you as a developer provide to the App Store for things that the app may, at some point, ask just to tell people ahead of time, just to be safe, and we just checked way too many boxes.\u201d\n\nBrownlee says that most of the boxes were checked because of \u201cbroad suggestions\u201d from the app\u2019s ad service, AdMob. \u201cTo be clear, I do not want your data,\u201d he says. He also points out that you can use the app and get wallpapers without making an account.\n\nIn the full video, which is more than 15 minutes long, Brownlee discusses other aspects of the app, too, like that there will be weekly drops on Fridays with new art and that he can \u201cpersonally promise\u201d that the app won\u2019t be filled with AI-generated slop.",

        "text": "The Verge\u2019s guide to moving\n\nMoving from one home to another can be extraordinarily nerve-racking. We offer some tips to help keep your stress levels down.\n\nMoving is one of the most stressful events that can happen in your life. It takes a lot of time and effort, it\u2019s expensive, it\u2019s complicated, and there\u2019s just a ton to do.\n\nIt\u2019s not just a matter of finding a place you can afford, signing the lease or arranging for a mortgage, and figuring out how to get your stuff from one place to another. You probably have to downsize and declutter before you move. You have to figure out which furniture to move, and which to keep, and get rid of all those old and outdated laptops and phones that have been moldering in the closet.\n\nAnd then, once you\u2019re in your new home, you have to set everything up again \u2014 including the tech. You have to reassemble your home office. You have to find a solid (and hopefully not too expensive) ISP and set up your wireless network and smart home devices. It\u2019s enough to make anyone cry.",

        "title": "Xbox Cloud Gaming will let you stream your own games in November",
        "text": "Microsoft is planning to support the streaming of Xbox game libraries next month. Sources familiar with Microsoft\u2019s plans tell The Verge that the company is getting ready to test the ability to stream games that you own that aren\u2019t part of the existing Xbox Game Pass library.\n\nAs part of a long-running project known as Project Lapland inside of Microsoft, the software giant has been readying its Xbox Cloud Gaming servers to be able to support streaming thousands of games. I\u2019m told Microsoft will first test its new Xbox Cloud Gaming streaming capabilities with Xbox Insiders in November, before expanding them to more Xbox users and more games.\n\nThe Xbox Cloud Gaming expansion comes in the same month Microsoft plans to enable game purchases in its Xbox mobile app for Android in the US. Microsoft is able to do this thanks to a court ruling earlier this week that forces Google to stop requiring Google Play Billing for apps in the Play Store on November 1st.\n\nXbox president Sarah Bond revealed yesterday that \u201cstarting in November, players will be able to play and purchase Xbox games directly from the Xbox App on Android.\u201d Once Microsoft\u2019s work to enable a full game library on Xbox Cloud Gaming is complete, you\u2019ll be able to purchase an Xbox game on Android and immediately stream it to your device.\n\nProject xCloud was supposed to launch with game library streaming in 2020. Microsoft then announced it would support your game library on Xbox Cloud Gaming in 2022, but it never launched that year. I understand the work has been complicated by having to prepare key infrastructure for thousands of games, instead of the hundreds that currently exist on Xbox Game Pass. While thousands of games will soon be available through Xbox Cloud Gaming, I\u2019m told some publishers will hold certain games back due to licensing requirements or deals.\n\nMicrosoft is also working on a browser-based Xbox mobile store that it was originally planning to launch in July. The store will initially include deals and in-game items but will grow to cover first-party games eventually. Microsoft said in August that testing had begun on the web-based mobile store and that \u201cwork is progressing well and we will have more to share in the future.\u201d\n\nUpdate, October 11th: Article updated to mention original Project xCloud plans.",

        "title": "The Optimus robots at Tesla\u2019s Cybercab event were humans in disguise",
        "text": "Tesla made sure its Optimus robots were a big part of its extravagant, in-person Cybercab reveal last week. The robots mingled with the crowd, served drinks to and played games with guests, and danced inside a gazebo. Seemingly most surprisingly, they could even talk. But it was mostly just a show.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious when you watch the videos from the event, of course. If Optimus really was a fully autonomous machine that could immediately react to verbal and visual cues while talking, one-on-one, to human beings in a dimly lit crowd, that would be mind-blowing.\n\nAttendee Robert Scoble posted that he\u2019d learned humans were \u201cremote assisting\u201d the robots, later clarifying that an engineer had told him the robots used AI to walk, spotted Electrek. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote that the robots \u201crelied on tele-ops (human intervention)\u201d in a note, the outlet reports.\n\nThere are obvious tells to back those claims up, like the fact that the robots all have different voices or that their responses were immediate, with gesticulation to match.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t feel like Tesla was going out of its way to make anyone think the Optimus machines were acting on their own. In another video that Jalopnik pointed to, an Optimus\u2019 voice jokingly told Scoble that \u201cit might be some\u201d when he asked it how much it was controlled by AI.\n\nAnother robot \u2014 or the human voicing it \u2014 told an attendee in a stilted impression of a synthetic voice, \u201cToday, I am assisted by a human,\u201d adding that it\u2019s not fully autonomous. (The voice stumbled on the word \u201cautonomous.\u201d)",

Almost seven minutes following liftoff, the Super Heavy booster returned to its launchpad, where the launch tower caught it using arms that SpaceX has nicknamed the \u201cchopsticks.\u201d\n\nThe remarkable catch was a first for SpaceX and an important step toward making the Super Heavy booster a fully reusable launch system just like SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 rockets. The booster completed a similar set of maneuvers to today\u2019s during its previous flight test in June, when it splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico, instead.\n\nSpaceX\u2019s South Texas launch tower catches the Super Heavy booster.

The craft reentered the Earth\u2019s atmosphere about 45 minutes after liftoff and carried out a \u201csoft\u201d splashdown in the Indian Ocean at 9:30AM ET. An explosion rocked the craft just after that.\n\nSpaceX redesigned Starship\u2019s heat shield for this test after Starship lost fragments of its shielding during reentry in June. The company used new heat shielding tiles and added an extra backup ablative layer, as ArsTechnica described last week.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) gave SpaceX approval for the test flight only yesterday. It had originally expected to clear this launch next month, but the FAA and its partner agencies reportedly carried out their assessments of SpaceX\u2019s preparations faster than anticipated.",

        "text": "There have been plenty of rumors swirling regarding a new iPad Mini for more than a year now, but most indicators point toward a processor bump and little else. We haven\u2019t heard much about a new entry-level iPad, though, which makes it a great time to pick up either the ninth- or 10th-gen model \u2014 both of which are still on sale for their best price to date in the wake of Amazon\u2019s October Prime Day sale.\n\nRight now, you can grab Apple\u2019s last-gen iPad at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target with Wi-Fi and 64GB of storage starting at $199 ($130 off). The 10th-gen model, meanwhile, is available from the same three retailers \u2014 Amazon, Best Buy, and Target \u2014 in the same configuration starting at $299 ($50 off). You can also pick up either with 256GB of storage for $349.99 ($130 off) and $449 ($50 off), respectively.\n\nBoth entry-level tablets are well-suited for streaming, browsing the web, and shooting off emails, though the newer model sports a slightly larger 10.9-inch screen and a faster processor in the form of Apple\u2019s A14 Bionic. It also features a USB-C port instead of Apple\u2019s Lightning connector (phew) and cribs some of the modern design language from the pricier iPad Air, resulting in smaller bezels and Touch ID fingerprint scanner in the power button.\n\nI\u2019d argue the 10th-gen model iPad is the better buy given its newer specs and current asking price; however, the ninth-gen model is still great for kids and anyone who wants a basic tablet at an affordable price. Hell, it even offers a 3.5mm headphone jack \u2014 a welcome rarity in 2024.\n\nVerge Deals on X / Join more than 50,000 followers and keep up with the best daily tech deals with @vergedeals Follow us!\n\nMore deals, discounts, and ways to save\n\nGoogle\u2019s Nest Thermostat is once again down to a mere $84.99 ($45 off) at Amazon, which is the lowest price we\u2019ve seen on the base model since July.

        "title": "Metaphor: ReFantazio is the rare fantasy game that goes beyond racism 101",
        "text": "I no longer expect video games that tackle the subjects of racism and discrimination through fantasy \u2014 as Metaphor: ReFantazio does \u2014 to surprise me. Those stories never go beyond well-trodden depictions of \u201cracism is bad,\u201d and I tune them out like so much white noise. But Metaphor: ReFantazio has done the work, and its willingness to go beyond surface-level treatments of tired fantasy tropes to dig at the heart of the real issues with racism and discrimination is exactly what makes it a phenomenal game. Metaphor is a clever evolution of the Persona series, but it wouldn\u2019t be as interesting or outstanding as it is without its refreshingly progressive message.\n\nMetaphor takes place in a world where our reality of \u201cequality\u201d between different ethnic groups is presented as an unattainable-but-nice-to-think-about idyllic fantasy, while discrimination, classism, and the struggle against monstrous creatures called \u201chumans\u201d rule the day.\n\nIn Metaphor, society is arranged into a racial hierarchy based on different fantastical physical features... or lack thereof. Image: Atlus\n\nThe world of Metaphor is stratified according to a hierarchy of different tribes classified by their physical characteristics, like wings, horns, or elfin-like long ears. Then there\u2019s the protagonist, who comes from the most hated tribe, which, to our eyes, resemble real-world humans with no distinct physical features. Atlus calling this game \u201cMetaphor\u201d is about as unsubtle as a brick thrown at a protest.\n\nAs I dive into the guts of what makes Metaphor so great, I do have to note the frequent issues I had with instability. I played the game on Xbox Series S and experienced numerous crashes that seemed related to the game\u2019s autosave feature. On top of that, when the game did crash and I rebooted my Xbox to start over, the game frequently reloaded without a video input. I could hear the start menu music but see nothing, requiring me to end my gaming sessions prematurely as the issue only seemed to fix itself after an overnight break. You can read more about Metaphor\u2019s technical performance in Eurogamer\u2019s review.\n\nThe world is thrown into chaos when the dogmatic king is murdered, leaving behind no heir, as his idealistic son mysteriously vanished years before. His death triggers a nationwide contest whereby anyone, no matter their birth or circumstance, can compete to win the throne, provided they have the love and support of the people. Your job is to earn that love through a variety of contests in the hope of putting that idealistic prince on the throne so that he may change this hateful racist world for the better.\n\nIn Metaphor, the characters utilize a job class system called archetypes. Each party member starts with a specific archetype \u2014 warrior, healer, mage, etc. \u2014 and by developing relationships with other NPCs, unlock more. Like Persona, combat is centered on exploiting an enemy\u2019s weakness while mitigating your own. There\u2019s also an absolutely fabulous overworld combat feature where if you strike a weaker enemy, they simply die, forgoing a transition into a battle scene. However, if an enemy is your level or stronger, you can use overworld combat to surprise attack and weaken them, giving you a serious advantage in the fight to come.\n\nThe slick menus of Persona-series fame return. Image: Atlus\n\nI adore these improvements over Persona\u2019s combat because it significantly cuts down on the time needed to grind experience. It also makes combat harrowing as hell because while you\u2019re able to ambush monsters, they can do the same to you. Metaphor\u2019s combat excels, exceeding its RPG cohort, because it demands that I think more strategically. Arrogantly running around a dungeon or into boss fights with your biggest, highest-level guns blazing is not always the winning strategy, and it\u2019s also a good way to get you killed.\n\nMy higher-level party was frequently wiped out by an enemy I\u2019d otherwise mop the floor with simply because they got the drop on me. Conversely, I\u2019ve been able to soundly defeat enemies eight and nine levels higher than me with freshly unlocked level-one archetypes because their special abilities were uniquely suited to exploit a weakness. Metaphor is the only single-player game that made me feel like a raid leader in an MMO like Final Fantasy XIV or World of Warcraft.\n\nMetaphor also feels good from a tactile perspective. The animations that play as you fluidly zip between different options in combat add a kinetic energy that made me feel like I was playing an action game instead of a turn-based RPG. This experience is enhanced by the slick-as-hell, highly stylized menus and the killer soundtrack \u2014 especially the main battle music. I don\u2019t know what that man is saying, but the way he says it gets me hype as hell.\n\nBut Metaphor is more than just a stylish, dynamic RPG \u2014 it\u2019s also the rare fantasy story that tackles discrimination with nuance.\n\nIn a lot of fantasy, I\u2019m annoyed by the storytelling conceit of using discrimination against fantasy races as an allegory for real-world racism. Stories featuring this trope usually stop at the \u201cracism is bad\u201d surface level, demonstrating that with ugly over-the-top displays of violence (hey there, Dragon Age) while ignoring the subtleties that make racism so heinous and pervasive. Metaphor manages to incorporate and tackle both aspects of this reality.\n\n\u201cRich people are corrupt\u201d is a sentiment frequently expressed in video games but rarely so... pointedly. Image: Atlus\n\nThere\u2019s a moment when you\u2019re reading a fantasy book with a companion, and they mention that realizing their goal of a world where everyone is treated equally won\u2019t be enough. \u201cEqual competition doesn\u2019t mean equal footing,\u201d Heismay says. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen a video game acknowledge that simply stopping the big bad evil racist won\u2019t magically make up for the countless generations of oppression. The game does the same with class and wealth. There\u2019s a character vying for the throne who wishes to essentially \u201ceat the rich\u201d and redistribute their wealth at the point of a guillotine. But by virtue of her extremely low status, she sees everybody with more than a few coins to rub together as her ideological enemy. It\u2019s just like when people in poverty lash out at other people a little bit less in poverty when their real enemies are the wealthy powerholders who exploit that animosity. It\u2019s awesome that the game calls that out.\n\nThere\u2019s an almost reflexive instinct to call Metaphor: ReFantazio \u201cPersona with swords.\u201d The game has the hallmarks of a Persona, which lend it an air of familiarity, not to mention much of the same creative talent. But this characterization doesn\u2019t feel correct. Those familiar systems have been remixed to feel fresh while the game\u2019s message is vibrating on levels the Persona games brush up against but never quite reach.\n\nHeismay says, \u201cDiversity, equality, and inclusion.\u201d Image: Atlus\n\nThe upsetting thing about racism, classism, homophobia, and the like is that there\u2019s a reluctance in the real world to acknowledge that it\u2019s not only the violence of individual actors that perpetuates this oppression but institutions and systems as well. We challenge those individual actors and call them out because that\u2019s much easier and quicker to do than the difficult generational work it takes to dismantle racist systems and build equitable ones. Games with that kind of message do the same \u2014 ending with the climactic defeat of the bad guys. Metaphor is one of the first times a high-profile game acknowledges the real, much harder, and less glamorous work of dismantling systems.\n\nAnd at a time when you can\u2019t even call out the individual actors anymore without getting gaslit to hell and back \u2014 it\u2019s moving, as a person of color, to see Metaphor go the extra mile to say, \u201cThese systems need to go, too.\u201d That\u2019s what makes Metaphor: ReFantazio so powerful, resonant, and in every sense of a word that\u2019s unfortunately been bastardized into meaninglessness, woke as fuck.",

        "title": "How we rate",
        "text": "How we score\n\nThe Verge reviews: how we test and review products\n\nProduct reviews can be a tricky thing. Every reviewer has a different style and different way of assessing a product, which is why no two reviews of the same product will ever read the same. At The Verge, we have built a reviews program that strives to standardize our reviews without abandoning the uniqueness of each of our reviewers. Below is a short guide to our methods and an explanation of our rating practices.\n\nGeneral reviewing\n\nOur reviews are, first and foremost, centered on real-life experience with the product. They are firmly based on the reviewer's experience of using the product for a substantial amount of time; they are absolutely never written off of a spec sheet or a fleeting experience with the product. Whatever the product is \u2014 a phone, laptop, TV, app, etc. \u2014 we strive to work it into our everyday lives and give the reader a picture of what it\u2019s like to use the product in the real world.\n\nBenchmarks and battery testing\n\nIn many cases, we crossbreed that anecdotal experience with systematic (or synthetic) benchmarks, especially in the realm of performance. Many of the tests are used industry-wide, with the exception of how we evaluate battery life.\n\nOur current battery testing method is entirely based on real-world usage. We use devices as we would use them in the real world and then come up with an evaluation based on how a device performs compared to devices we\u2019ve tested previously. In the case of laptops, we set the screen to 200 nits of brightness (or as close as we can get to that using the laptop\u2019s brightness adjustment tools) and then include what activities we did on the machine while we were evaluating its battery stamina.\n\nThis form of testing can produce different results for different users (which why we include how we used the device during the test), but we feel that our real-world evaluation of battery life is more indicative of how a device will actually perform when you buy it as opposed to other rundown tests that don\u2019t reflect actual device usage.\n\nScoring\n\nEvery reviewed product (unless otherwise noted) is given a score. We score a product based on a variety of performance, value, and subjective criteria. Since the score is not a weighted average, the editor reserves the right to adjust the average to better reflect the overall assessment of the product, including the price and other qualities that aren\u2019t always included in rigid rubrics. A score is best viewed as a snapshot in time that is compared to other devices available at the time the review is published; a device would likely not receive the same score if it were to be reviewed six months later, for example.\n\nIt\u2019s possible we may change the score in a review after it is published due to software updates or other changes. We\u2019ve only had to do that in exceedingly rare cares, and we will always include our reasoning about why a score changed if and when it happens.\n\nWe assume the 10-point scale is relatively straightforward, but below is a short guide as to how we view the numbers. All review scores are whole points. We no longer use half points or decimals when scoring a product.\n\nUtter garbage and an embarrassment. A product that should be avoided at all costs. Bad \u2014 not something we\u2019d recommend. Mediocre \u2014 has multiple outstanding issues. Just okay. This product works well in some areas but likely has significant issues in others. Good. There are issues but also redeeming qualities. Very good. A solid product with some flaws. Excellent. A superb product with minor or very few flaws. Nearly perfect. The best of the best.",

        "title": "Garmin Fenix 8 review: only kind of smart",
        "text": "There used to be a clear divide between smartwatches and multisport watches. On one side, you had Apple Watches, Fitbits, and Galaxy Watches, with their snazzy screens, voice assistants, and third-party apps. On the other, you had Garmin, with its rugged watches, killer tracking, and great battery life.\n\nThat line has gotten a lot blurrier in the past few years. The Apple Watch Ultra and Galaxy Watch Ultra have taken several pages from Garmin\u2019s playbook. And now, with the $999.99 Fenix 8, Garmin is striking back. If its rivals want to add fitness features, well, Garmin\u2019s just going to make the Fenix 8 smarter.\n\n7 Verge Score Garmin Fenix 8 $ 999.99 The Good Smartens up Garmin\u2019s flagship multisport watch\n\nExcellent battery and fitness tracking\n\nOffers MIP and OLED display options\n\nCondenses the Fenix and Epix lines into one The Bad The starting price is $350 more than the Fenix 7!\n\nSmart features are less helpful without LTE $1000 at Amazon How we rate and review products\n\nThe big additions to the Fenix 8 are a speaker and microphone. They mean you can now interact with the watch in more ways than fitness tracking and training. You can take calls from the wrist, use an on-device voice assistant for setting timers and starting activities, and connect to your phone\u2019s built-in assistant for more complex queries. If you can convince your loved ones to download the new Garmin Messenger app, replying to messages on the wrist has also gotten easier.\n\nTheoretically, these are all good updates. In practice, it means the Fenix 8 doesn\u2019t play to Garmin\u2019s strengths.\n\nKinda smart\n\nThe Fenix 8 is the top dog in Garmin\u2019s extensive smartwatch lineup. While it\u2019s not as chunky as older Fenix models, it\u2019s not meant to be a sleek lifestyle watch like the Venu series or sporty, lightweight option like the Forerunner. There\u2019s gravitas to its design. It\u2019s the premium choice for serious athletes who want everything Garmin can throw at them \u2014 and that\u2019s why Garmin is bringing a lot of these smart features to the Fenix 8.\n\nThe bulk of the \u201csmart\u201d updates zero in on the addition of the microphone and speaker \u2014 namely, voice assistants and calling from the wrist. But there\u2019s a big factor holding back the Fenix 8\u2019s smart features: the lack of LTE.\n\nGarmin Fenix 8 Specs Material: stainless steel or titanium, Gorilla Glass or sapphire crystal\n\nDisplay: memory-in-pixel or OLED\n\nConnectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth\n\nSizes: MIP watches: 47mm, 51mm; OLED watches: 43mm, 47mm, 51mm\n\nWeight: 43mm: 66g stainless steel, 60g titanium; 47mm: 80g stainless steel, 73g titanium; 51mm: 102g stainless steel, 92g titanium\n\n66g stainless steel, 60g titanium; 80g stainless steel, 73g titanium; 102g stainless steel, 92g titanium Battery life: 43mm: up to 10 days, four days w/ AOD; 47mm: up to 16 days, seven days w/ AOD for OLED and up to 21 days for MIP with 28 days solar charging; 51mm: up to 29 days, 13 w/ AOD for OLED and 30 days for MIP w/ 48 with solar charging\n\nup to 10 days, four days w/ AOD; up to 16 days, seven days w/ AOD for OLED and up to 21 days for MIP with 28 days solar charging; up to 29 days, 13 w/ AOD for OLED and 30 days for MIP w/ 48 with solar charging Sensors: optical heart rate sensor, EKG, blood oxygen sensor, gyroscope, compass, accelerometer, thermometer, ambient light sensor, depth sensor,\n\nGPS: dual-frequency GPS\n\nWater resistance: 10ATM\n\nNFC: yes\n\nCompatibility: iPhone and Android\n\nYes, you can make and receive calls with the Fenix 8\u2026 so long as your phone is within Bluetooth range. Yes, you can talk to a voice assistant\u2026 but it\u2019s limited unless your phone is nearby. Yes, you can reply to texts, but\u2026 you get my drift. If you get a cellular Apple Watch, Galaxy Watch, or Pixel Watch, you can leave your phone at home. That\u2019s not really an option with the Fenix 8.\n\nThe friction is particularly noticeable with the on-device voice assistant. The assistant works pretty well, but it\u2019s mostly limited to commands that don\u2019t require an internet connection. You can start activities, set timers, and tweak settings. (It can tell you the weather, provided it\u2019s loaded the day\u2019s weather from Wi-Fi or\u2026 your phone via Bluetooth.) But say you want to send a text message. This nameless assistant can\u2019t do that. Instead, you\u2019ll have to scroll to a different menu and launch your phone\u2019s assistant. It\u2019s good to have that option, but at that point, you\u2019re probably just going to whip out your phone anyway.\n\nPart of the problem is that Garmin has always been staunchly platform-agnostic. I happen to think that\u2019s a good thing, but the price you pay is never having your watch work quite as seamlessly with your phone. For example, it\u2019s great that you can dictate voice memos now, but their usefulness is limited because there\u2019s no easy way to get them off your wrist and onto another device. That\u2019s unlike the Pixel Watch 3, where I can just record something, and boom, it\u2019s magically on my Pixel 8 Pro.\n\nShortly after this text, she asked if she could delete the Garmin Messenger app. Screenshot: Garmin Messenger app\n\nAnother prime example is the new Garmin Messenger. Ostensibly, this is to help iOS Garmin users reply more easily to messages on the wrist. (Android users have always been able to send quick replies to texts, but Apple gon\u2019 Apple.) Good luck convincing friends and family to download yet another chat app so you can reply to messages on your Fenix 8! I roped one friend into it. It worked, but it was kind of a hassle to use: you can\u2019t dictate messages, the canned responses are limited, and for some reason, Garmin thought bringing back a T9 keyboard was a good idea. At the end of the test, I asked my friend if she\u2019d ever use the Garmin Messenger app to reach me. Her words: \u201cOnly if I had to.\u201d Followed by \u201cAlso, can I delete the app now?\u201d\n\nA good chunk of this smart feature awkwardness would be solved with a cellular option \u2014 and it\u2019d enhance Garmin\u2019s existing safety tools, too. But there\u2019s a reason most third-party smartwatch makers don\u2019t offer LTE options: dealing with carriers is a pain. It took Fossil ages to offer an LTE option, and even then, it only ever managed a single carrier before quitting smartwatches entirely. Garmin has LTE options for its Forerunner 945 watch and its Bounce kids tracker, but those require a separate Garmin subscription and are limited to safety features.\n\nBlessed consolidation\n\nI\u2019ve often criticized Garmin for making way too many smartwatches. The Fenix 8 thankfully makes things simpler at the top end by combining the Fenix and Epix lineups.\n\nLike Garmin\u2019s on-device assistant, I, too, sometimes crash while processing requests.\n\nThe second-gen Epix, introduced in 2022, was essentially a Fenix with an OLED display. The problem was that Garmin then had two premium watches that were very similar. The main difference was the memory-in-pixel (MIP) display on the Fenix and the OLED display on the Epix Pro. The MIP version gets better battery life, whereas OLED offers much better visibility indoors. It\u2019s a clear choice for ultra-athletes but confusing for everyone else.\n\nNow, you can just choose between an MIP or OLED Fenix 8. It\u2019d be perfect if not for just one baby beef: petite-wristed folks don\u2019t get to pick anything other than the OLED display.\n\nThe MIP Fenix 8 only comes in 47mm and 51mm sizes. In principle, I\u2019m annoyed for the small-wristed athlete who wants an MIP display. But the reality is the battery bump from an MIP display isn\u2019t quite as impressive on the smaller watches. I got nine to 11 days on last year\u2019s 42mm Fenix 7S Pro. This year, I got eight to nine days on the OLED 43mm Fenix 8 with the always-on display turned off. (That dwindles to about four days with it on.) I still think you should give people the option, but I also understand why Garmin didn\u2019t. For what it\u2019s worth, I tested the OLED, and that\u2019s what I\u2019d recommend if you want good indoor visibility. If you\u2019re trekking out in a lot of harsh, direct sunlight, MIP is the way to go.\n\nEven with that quibble, consolidating with the Fenix 8 was a refreshing and welcome change. I\u2019d love to see Garmin streamline some of its other smartwatch lineups. I don\u2019t know that it will, as Garmin rarely passes up a chance to do more, but one can hope.\n\nNobody likes a price hike\n\nIt\u2019s a shame. Despite the upgrades, the Fenix 8 is only sort of better at being a smartwatch. It\u2019s still an excellent training watch, and its battery far outlasts both Apple and Samsung\u2019s Ultras. But I\u2019m simply not convinced anyone\u2019s going to ditch either one for a Fenix just because they can now interact with a voice assistant or make calls from the wrist.\n\nEveryone I\u2019ve ever met with a Fenix watch has been a triathlete, ultramarathoner, or someone who casually qualifies for the Boston Marathon with a sub-three-hour marathon time. These folks pick something like the Fenix because they need a tracker with mondo battery life, stellar GPS accuracy, in-depth training programs, and maps for traversing trails. Those are the features that people would leave Apple or Samsung for \u2014 and they don\u2019t get a major upgrade with the Fenix 8.\n\nAdding a speaker and a mic lets you take phone calls. But sensor-wise, you\u2019re not getting an upgrade over last year\u2019s Fenix 7 Pro or Epix Pro.\n\nTo make matters worse, I almost choked when I saw the Fenix 8\u2019s starting price was a whole $350 more than the Fenix 7. That\u2019s not a $50 to $100 hike where you grumble and then begrudgingly admit that inflation is a bitch. For $999, you could buy a laptop. Hell, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is $800, while the Galaxy Watch Ultra is $650. And those do come with LTE. If you\u2019re determined to get a Garmin, there are literally dozens of cheaper options. (Might I suggest the $450 Forerunner 265 or a discounted Fenix 7 Pro or Epix Pro?)\n\nIt\u2019s frustrating because Garmin is right to shore up its smart features. There\u2019s not much to improve on the fitness front, so making its watches more useful outside of training makes a lot of sense. It\u2019s also crystal clear that Garmin has some catching up to do, and progress isn\u2019t going to happen overnight. The Fenix 8 might be on the right track, but it doesn\u2019t quite nail the price or execution.",

        "title": "How the DOJ wants to break up Google\u2019s search monopoly",
        "text": "After winning a fight to get Google\u2019s search business declared an unlawful monopoly, the Department of Justice has released its initial proposal for how it\u2019s thinking about limiting Google\u2019s dominance \u2014 including breaking up the company.\n\nThe government is asking Judge Amit Mehta for four different types of remedies to Google\u2019s anticompetitive power in search engines. They include behavioral remedies, or changes to business practices, as well as structural remedies, which would break up Google. And they\u2019re focused particularly on futureproofing the search industry for the rise of generative AI. While AI might not be a substitute for search engines, the DOJ warns, it \u201cwill likely become an important feature of the evolving search industry.\u201d And it aims to prevent Google from using its power in the industry to regain unfair control.\n\nThe DOJ also has a particular focus on futureproofing the solutions\n\nThe government sees four areas where it can constrain Google\u2019s power. In these, it\u2019s asking Judge Mehta to limit the kinds of contracts Google can negotiate, require rules for nondiscrimination and interoperability, and change the structure of its business. \u201cFully remedying these harms requires not only ending Google\u2019s control of distribution today, but also ensuring Google cannot control the distribution of tomorrow,\u201d the government says. Google, for its part, calls the government\u2019s proposals \u201cradical\u201d and believes they\u2019re \u201csignaling requests that go far beyond the specific legal issues in this case.\u201d\n\nWhat does that mean for Google\u2019s competitors and the average user? Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nSearch distribution and revenue sharing\n\nGoogle\u2019s search engine comes preloaded on many phones and is the default on most major web browsers, often because of revenue sharing deals that pay for that placement. The DOJ argued in court that consumers are highly unlikely to switch to a competitor, and Google\u2019s commercial partners also have little incentive to do so while they\u2019re getting paid. So, the DOJ says \u201cundoing\u201d Google\u2019s impact on distribution is the \u201cstarting point for addressing Google\u2019s unlawful conduct.\u201d\n\nThe government says it\u2019s considering restrictions on the contracts Google can strike with phone makers and browser companies, particularly agreements to make Google Search a default or have it preinstalled.\n\nGoogle doesn\u2019t just strike deals with other companies, though \u2014 it promotes its search engine and AI business with an array of other Google products, including Chrome, Android, and the Play Store. The DOJ argues this limits the available channels and incentives for rivals to compete. It didn\u2019t offer too many details about how to fix this but said it\u2019s considering both behavioral and structural remedies \u2014 in other words, a breakup.\n\nAnd finally, a group of states that filed a related lawsuit want to address a final problem: users not realizing they\u2019ve got other options. They\u2019re considering ways Google could support education campaigns that inform people about competing search engines.\n\nAccumulation and use of data\n\nAt trial, the government argued that Google creates a self-reinforcing cycle of dominance through users\u2019 query data. Essentially, the more queries a search engine gets, the more information it has about what constitutes a useful answer, and the better the search engine becomes. Because Google\u2019s rivals don\u2019t have the same access to distribution channels that Google does, the DOJ argued, Google is able to siphon away most of these queries, making it much more difficult for rivals to improve their products and effectively compete.\n\nThe government says it wants to try to \u201coffset\u201d that advantage, potentially by forcing Google to make certain information and aspects of its product available to rivals. That could include things like data, indexes, and models used in \u201cAI-assisted search features\u201d and ranking signals Google uses in search.\n\n\u201c... genuine privacy concerns must be distinguished from pretextual arguments to maintain market position or deny scale to rivals\u201d\n\nThe DOJ says it\u2019s \u201cmindful of potential user privacy concerns\u201d that making Google share data would raise. \u201cHowever, genuine privacy concerns must be distinguished from pretextual arguments to maintain market position or deny scale to rivals.\u201d Privacy tradeoffs are a common defense from big tech firms against opening up their ecosystems, but the government is making clear that it doesn\u2019t think they\u2019re a be-all and end-all. It\u2019s considering prohibiting Google from using data that \u201ccannot be effectively shared with others on the basis of privacy concerns.\u201d\n\nGeneration and display of search results\n\nThe government is also concerned with \u201cnew and developing features of general search,\u201d particularly generative AI. In this field, it argues much of Google\u2019s power stems from scraping data from sites with \u201clittle-to-no bargaining power against Google\u2019s monopoly.\u201d These sites may not want their work used to train AI models, but they \u201ccannot risk retaliation or exclusion from Google\u201d by blocking its crawlers altogether. As a result, the DOJ is considering requiring that Google let sites opt in to search engine inclusion while opting out of inclusion in its AI tools.\n\nAdvertising scale and monetization\n\nIn addition to the general search market, Mehta found that Google has monopoly power in the market for general search text ads: the sponsored text links that appear when you enter a query. (This is different from the market at issue in Google\u2019s second legal battle with the DOJ, which dealt with the tools used to serve ads on publishers\u2019 sites across the internet.) Mehta found that Google does not consider rivals\u2019 prices in figuring out its own for this product \u2014 something he says only a monopolist with no meaningful competition could do.",

        "title": "Photoshop is getting a bunch of new AI tools",
        "text": "Adobe is kicking off its annual Adobe Max conference today with the launch of new AI-powered features across its Creative Cloud apps. New AI features for Photoshop, like automatic background distraction removal and a more powerful Firefly generative AI model, are the biggest announcements, with Illustrator, InDesign, and Premiere Pro also getting new features that can help to speed up traditionally labor-intensive design tasks.\n\nFor example, a new \u201cDistraction Removal\u201d feature has been added to the Remove Tool. Remove already works a bit like Google\u2019s Magic Eraser feature on Pixel phones, allowing users to quickly remove unwanted objects from their images by brushing over them. The new Distraction Removal feature, which Adobe teased last year, makes it even more like Magic Eraser by automatically identifying common distractions for you, like people, wires, and cables, and removing them with a single click.\n\nUsers no longer need even to brush over the distraction they want to delete \u2014 the Remove Tool can now find and remove them automatically. Image: Adobe\n\nDistraction Removal is available now in Photoshop\u2019s desktop and web apps, with \u201cmore to come later,\u201d according to Adobe. Photoshop users can now also choose whether the Remove Tool uses generative AI \u2014 specifically Adobe\u2019s Firefly image model \u2014 or non-generative AI tech, with a third option that automatically selects which tech to use \u201cbased on the image and scene\u201d to produce the best results.\n\nPhotoshop\u2019s Generative Fill, Generative Expand, Generate Similar, and Generate Background tools are now generally available and have been updated with the latest Firefly Image 3 Model that was launched in beta in April. Adobe says this update improves the variety and photorealistic quality of generated outputs, and understands complex prompts better than the previous model. Photoshop\u2019s web app also has a new AI feature that makes editing easier by automatically selecting all the objects in an image.\n\nAdobe says the updated Firefly Image model can produce a better variety of images to suit users needs. Image: Adobe\n\nAdobe Illustrator is being updated with a new \u201cObjects on Path\u201d feature that allows users to quickly attach, arrange, and move objects along any path shape, giving designers more flexibility when aligning areas of their work. The Mockup tool for staging designs on a 3D model is also now widely available, and the Image Trace feature that converts raster images (JPEG, PNG, PSD etc) to scalable vectors has been improved, too. Adobe says it now creates \u201ccrisper vectorized outputs with cleaner lines that are more accurate to the original image.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how the new Objects on Path feature works in Illustrator.

This \u201cminimal\u201d update, which he labels a fork of the Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin, is now called \u201cSecure Custom Fields.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what security problem Mullenweg is referring to in the post.

        "title": "Fujifilm goes after aspiring vloggers with its new $800 X-M5 camera",
        "text": "Even as it keeps working to catch up with demand for the massively popular X100VI, Fujifilm has been on a steady cadence of releasing new cameras. The X-T50 was announced in May, and it was the first to feature a physical dial for switching between the company\u2019s signature film simulations. That dial is carrying forward to the new, budget-tier X-M5 that Fujifilm is announcing today.\n\nThe X-M5 is priced at $799.95 and is an affordable gateway into the company\u2019s interchangeable lens mirrorless camera lineup.. Fujifilm is positioning it as a lightweight camera ideal for everyday shooting and \u201cemerging content creators\u201d who want to vlog with it \u2014 despite a lack of in-body image stabilization (IBIS). At 13 ounces (355 grams), the X-M5 is the lightest body in Fujifilm\u2019s current X-Series family. It comes in silver or black, but the black version won\u2019t be shipping until April. The silver will be in stores next month.\n\nThe X-M5 is the second camera to have a dedicated dial for Fujifilm\u2019s film simulations. Image: Fujifilm\n\nFujifilm is pushing the message that for as good as our smartphone cameras might be, the X-M5 has a far larger sensor that\u2019s capable of capturing more. At the top left of the camera is the film simulation dial, which offers quick access to eight film simulations and three custom slots where you can assign another favorite from the 20 built-in options. The X-M5 also has a PASM-style mode dial, a fully articulating rear LCD (though there\u2019s no EVF), and the microphone input is in a unique spot on the back of the camera near the hotshoe.\n\nBut even if you don\u2019t have an external mic, the X-M5 is Fujifilm\u2019s first camera to include a three-mic system. \u201cYou can choose from four microphone directivity options: surround, front, back, or front and back, depending on the situation,\u201d the company\u2019s press release says. To help with clearer audio, the camera is also capable of cutting out steady-state noises like air conditioning or other constant hums.\n\nThe X-M5 has a fully articulating rear display. Image: Fujifilm\n\nThe X-M5 includes Fujifilm\u2019s tried and true 26.1-megapixel CMOS sensor and the company\u2019s current-generation X-Processor 5. Fujifilm can\u2019t seem to escape criticism of its system\u2019s continuous autofocus performance, and so the company is rolling out a newly-enhanced predictive autofocus algorithm that it believes should rectify the inconsistent hit rate that some customers have experienced with its recent cameras.\n\nFor video, the camera can capture 6.2K/30P 4:2:2 10-bit video, and in this era of vertical social media content, it\u2019s also got a 9:16 \u201cShort Movie Mode\u201d that caps out at full HD resolution.\n\nThere are several tradeoffs that Fujifilm had to make to hit the X-M5\u2019s price. The rear LCD has an unremarkable resolution of 1.04 million dots. (By comparison, the X-S20 has a 1.84-million dot LCD.) The camera also uses Fujifilm\u2019s older and smaller-capacity battery, so if you\u2019re out for a long day of vlogging, it\u2019ll be wise to carry a spare. And the SD card slot is still UHS-I. That shouldn\u2019t be a huge issue for the target market here, but it\u2019s worth mentioning.\n\nThe new 16-55 f/2.8 II, seen here on an X-T5, is significantly smaller and lighter than the original. Image: Fujifilm\n\nIn addition to its latest body, Fujifilm is also announcing the second version of its very impressive XF16-55 f/2.8 lens. The new glass is significantly smaller and lighter than the original, which has grown to be perhaps my favorite lens in Fujifilm\u2019s arsenal. But it can definitely get heavy at times \u2014 especially on my X-H2 \u2014 so I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what a difference the downsizing has made. Fujfilm says the new model is even sharper and better at resolving the 40-megapixel sensor found in the X-T5, X-H2, and X-T50. It costs the same $1,199.95 as before and will be available in December.\n\nYou\u2019d never catch me using a lens this expensive in a situation like what\u2019s depicted here. That rock looks slippery! But much respect to this man. Image: Fujifilm",

        "title": "Photoshop is getting a bunch of new AI tools",
        "text": "Adobe is kicking off its annual Adobe Max conference today with the launch of new AI-powered features across its Creative Cloud apps. New AI features for Photoshop, like automatic background distraction removal and a more powerful Firefly generative AI model, are the biggest announcements, with Illustrator, InDesign, and Premiere Pro also getting new features that can help to speed up traditionally labor-intensive design tasks.\n\nFor example, a new \u201cDistraction Removal\u201d feature has been added to the Remove Tool. Remove already works a bit like Google\u2019s Magic Eraser feature on Pixel phones, allowing users to quickly remove unwanted objects from their images by brushing over them. The new Distraction Removal feature, which Adobe teased last year, makes it even more like Magic Eraser by automatically identifying common distractions for you, like people, wires, and cables, and removing them with a single click.\n\nUsers no longer need even to brush over the distraction they want to delete \u2014 the Remove Tool can now find and remove them automatically. Image: Adobe\n\nDistraction Removal is available now in Photoshop\u2019s desktop and web apps, with \u201cmore to come later,\u201d according to Adobe. Photoshop users can now also choose whether the Remove Tool uses generative AI \u2014 specifically Adobe\u2019s Firefly image model \u2014 or non-generative AI tech, with a third option that automatically selects which tech to use \u201cbased on the image and scene\u201d to produce the best results.\n\nPhotoshop\u2019s Generative Fill, Generative Expand, Generate Similar, and Generate Background tools are now generally available and have been updated with the latest Firefly Image 3 Model that was launched in beta in April. Adobe says this update improves the variety and photorealistic quality of generated outputs, and understands complex prompts better than the previous model. Photoshop\u2019s web app also has a new AI feature that makes editing easier by automatically selecting all the objects in an image.\n\nAdobe says the updated Firefly Image model can produce a better variety of images to suit users needs.

The Mockup tool for staging designs on a 3D model is also now widely available, and the Image Trace feature that converts raster images (JPEG, PNG, PSD etc) to scalable vectors has been improved, too. Adobe says it now creates \u201ccrisper vectorized outputs with cleaner lines that are more accurate to the original image.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how the new Objects on Path feature works in Illustrator.

In theory.\n\nIf I had to guess, what will really happen is that Premium users will show up in replies even more than they already are. People who subscribe to X Premium already get priority in tweet replies, and the level of that priority depends on which X Premium tier they subscribe to.\n\nWe don\u2019t know yet if the new approach will actually lead to higher payouts for creators. While X promises that signing up for X Premium can help you \u201cearn a living on X,\u201d subscribers have complained about low payouts under the current terms.\n\nX says in its creator revenue sharing terms that it will remove users from the program if they are found to artificially inflate views on their posts, but we\u2019ll have to wait and see if that actually stops users from trying to find ways to game the system. \u201cOnly genuine interactions from Premium users will be counted toward your earnings,\u201d according to X\u2019s Premium account.\n\nRevenue from \u201cverified ads impressions\u201d in replies won\u2019t affect revenue sharing starting November 8th, according to a support document.

That\u2019s the stuff you like \u2014 or maybe just tolerate \u2014 and use every day, the stuff you hate and try to avoid using at all costs, and the stuff in between that you love and hate because your job revolves entirely around using it all day long.\n\nBusiness changed radically when software entered the office \u2014 it\u2019s the foundation of Marc Andreessen\u2019s now-famous quote, \u201cSoftware is eating the world.\u201d And everything might be about to change drastically all over again, as AI automates more and more of that software.

Subscribe here!\n\nThese tools are usually all called enterprise software, but there are often big overlaps with the popular productivity tools many of us use in our regular lives as well. So first, I wanted to ask David to help define it all. Then I wanted to talk about the state of all these industries right now and how these tools shape how we do work every day in subtle and powerful ways.\n\nWe talk about familiar tools like Microsoft Office, Google Workspace, and Slack, of course. But as you\u2019ll hear David explain, we\u2019ve started to see scores of new apps crop up to handle very specific use cases. These programs are building clever metaphors and interesting new interfaces to try to rewire our brains and make us work differently \u2014 presumably faster, more efficiently, and nowadays, more remotely.\n\nSometimes that works\u2026 and sometimes it really, really doesn\u2019t. And it feels like the addition of AI to the mix will accelerate the pace of experimentation here in pretty radical ways. Something is changing, and I often find the best way to understand the future is to take a moment to consider the present.\n\nWe talked about a lot of articles and interviews in this episode, including:",

        "title": "The Tesla Cybercab is a cool-looking prototype that needed to be much more than that",
        "text": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk could have taken the stage at last night\u2019s \u201cWe, Robot\u201d event and put a lot of fears to rest.\n\nHe could have released comprehensive safety data for the company\u2019s Full Self-Driving feature that showed real progress for the driver-assist feature, contradicting all the crowdsourced data that\u2019s out there making FSD look truly awful.\n\nHe could have announced that the Cybercab, a sleek little two-seater with butterfly-wing doors, would be a geofenced, Level 4, fleet-owned vehicle, operating in a few select markets with impressive-looking margins.\n\nHe could have provided an ounce of detail about the Cybercab\u2019s technology stack, including its sensors, vision system, and onboard processing power. And he could have shocked the industry and surprised many of his doubters by embracing lidar, the laser sensor that serves as a crucial redundant system for every other driverless vehicle on Earth.\n\nBut he did none of those things. Instead, he put on what arguably looked like a great show, complete with fake movie posters, a ton of delicious-looking food, and robot bartenders. And he fell back on the same old, tired promises of a fully autonomous vehicle that was \u201cjust two years away.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve been down this road before. Many times.\n\nA concept car for ghosts. Image: Tesla\n\n\u201cPrototype hardware that works in a limited demo is cool, interesting, and fine to comment on,\u201d Phil Koopman, an AV expert from Carnegie Mellon, wrote in his newsletter this morning. \u201cBut it is not production, and hardware is not the limit to autonomous vehicles. Software is the long pole in the tent.\u201d\n\nAt first glance, it would seem as if the event did the trick. There were plenty of Tesla fans who were thoroughly impressed by what they saw last night and ready to declare that it was \u201cgame over\u201d for every other player in the field. The Robovan wowed many with its Art Deco styling. And positive vibes extended to the company\u2019s most bullish investors, some of whom participated in Musk\u2019s theme park experience and came away forever altered.\n\nWith this Robovan, I thee wed. Image: Tesla\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives, who was in attendance, dismissed any stock decline in the aftermath of the event \u2014 Tesla was trading down by nearly 9 points in early trading Friday \u2014 as a \u201cknee-jerk reaction\u201d that would eventually correct itself. \u201cWe strongly disagree with the notion that last night was a disappointment,\u201d he wrote Friday, \u201cas we would argue the opposite seeing Cybercab with our own eyes and the massive improvements in Optimus which we interacted with throughout the evening.\u201d\n\nIt appears to be lost on some people how much things have changed since 2016, when Musk first promised that Full Self-Driving was a mere \u201ctwo years away.\u201d Many seem to be stuck in that outdated mindset that autonomous driving was an easy problem to solve and that fully driverless cars were on the cusp of taking over the world.\n\nNo steering wheel, so many questions. Image: Tesla\n\nSince then, interest rates have skyrocketed, the buckets of ample venture capital funding have dried up, and most of the major players working on this technology have since reconfigured their timelines to account for how long it will take for self-driving cars to prove they can be safer than humans. Even Waymo, which is far and away the leader in the space, is taking things real slowly, one city at a time. It can\u2019t promise the world; the company is still trying to figure out highways.\n\nMusk is promising the opposite. He said that Tesla plans to launch fully autonomous driving in Texas and California next year, with the Cybercab entering production by 2026. Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles with \u201cunsupervised\u201d Full Self-Driving would come first. But he promised that people could even buy the Cybercab for a price \u201cless than $30,000.\u201d Potential owners would be like shepherds, tending their flock of little driverless cabs, roaming the streetscape.\n\nLast night, his pitch veered utopian, as images of parking lots transformed into verdant gardens displayed on the giant screens above him. (I call this \u201creverse Joni Mitchell-ing.\u201d)\n\n\u201cWe want to have a fun, exciting future,\u201d he said, \u201cthat if you could look in a crystal ball and see that future, you\u2019d be like, \u2018Yes, I wish I could be there now.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt was kind of nice to hear Mr. \u201cDark MAGA\u201d articulate a brighter vision for the future, but after the event, it\u2019s even less clear how we\u2019ll get there. We got no details about how he will overcome the enormous obstacles in his path. Here\u2019s a quick rundown of some of the issues that went unresolved:\n\nRegulatory approval. Tesla will need to obtain a permit from the California DMV to operate fully driverless vehicles on public roads. And in order to do that, it will need to demonstrate that its vehicles can operate safely \u2014 which so far, the company has not done. And to produce a completely steering wheel-less Cybercab will require waivers from the federal government. That is a multi-month process, and success is far from guaranteed.\n\nTesla will need to obtain a permit from the California DMV to operate fully driverless vehicles on public roads.

        "title": "Apple\u2019s Disclaimer uses sex and scandal to shape your perception of reality",
        "text": "Part of / The best entertainment of 2024\n\nDisclaimer feels like a direct response to the way studios have grown skittish about producing bona fide erotic thrillers aimed squarely at adults. Though the Apple TV Plus series is a cinematic delight and its lead performances are tremendous, its raw sexuality is what makes it seem like writer / director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n (Gravity, Children of Men) is trying to get you into a very specific kind of headspace. But what\u2019s brilliant about Disclaimer is the way it uses its sensuality to complicate your read on its wild puzzle box mystery.\n\nBased on Ren\u00e9e Knight\u2019s 2015 novel, Disclaimer tells the story of Catherine Ravenscroft (Cate Blanchett), a respected journalist whose life begins to unravel after she receives a copy of a strange manuscript titled \u201cThe Perfect Stranger.\u201d After Catherine\u2019s years of exposing the shady secrets of powerful people with her documentaries, there are plenty of people who might want their revenge. But as Catherine pages through \u201cThe Perfect Stranger,\u201d it becomes very obvious that the person behind it \u2014 retired teacher Stephen Brigstocke (Kevin Kline) \u2014 somehow knows things about her that no one could ever be privy to.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that \u201cThe Perfect Stranger\u201d gets into Catherine\u2019s personal life; it recounts with stunning clarity a specific summer from 20 years in the past when she (portrayed in flashback by Leila George) first met Stephen\u2019s 19-year-old son Jonathan (Louis Partridge) while vacationing with her own young son. Despite Catherine having kept her affair with Jonathan secret from her husband Robert (Sacha Baron Cohen), the manuscript describes in vivid detail every single one of the lovers\u2019 trysts. And with Jonathan having died under mysterious circumstances that same summer, Stephen\u2019s assertion that he blames Catherine for the death and plans to publish the book leaves her blood running cold.\n\nAs Catherine\u2019s fear shifts her into investigative reporter mode and she sets out to stop Stephen, Disclaimer leans further into its premise by narrating its story from a perspective that gives you insight into how \u201cThe Perfect Stranger\u201d impacts the people who receive pieces of it. Seeing so many of her darkest secrets spelled out in plain text sends Catherine into an internal panic that\u2019s decidedly at odds with the veneer of normalcy she puts on for Robert and their emotionally distant son Nicholas (Kodi Smit-McPhee). And after picking up on a change in his wife, Robert can\u2019t help but feel fear and confusion of his own when he starts receiving risque photos of her from Stephen in the mail.\n\nViewed through one lens, Disclaimer reads as a psychological drama about an elderly stalker terrorizing a woman as a way to deal with the grief of losing his family. That\u2019s the story Disclaimer presents as it zooms in on Stephen\u2019s life in the present where he reminisces about his son and late wife Nancy (Lesley Manville). But Cuar\u00f3n paints an increasingly complicated picture of what\u2019s truly going on with each of the show\u2019s beatific flashbacks to the sundrenched summer Catherine has tried to put behind her.\n\nDisclaimer leaves you to differentiate between fact and fiction as it hops between timelines to carefully illustrate how people\u2019s perceptions of reality are shaped by stories they tell themselves. There\u2019s never any question that Catherine is hiding secrets that Robert wants to hurt her with, but Cuar\u00f3n invites you to consider how a book like \u201cThe Perfect Stranger\u201d \u2014 one full of such closely guarded information \u2014 could have been written by someone who wasn\u2019t there when it all went down. It\u2019s an obvious question that feels like the sort of thing someone might bring up immediately in the face of having their lives turned upside down by a surprise expos\u00e9. But Cuar\u00f3n dramatizes the book\u2019s scandalous contents in a way that, when coupled with the show\u2019s utterly gorgeous cinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki and Bruno Delbonnel, emphasizes the power stories have to influence the way we understand other people.\n\nImage: Apple\n\nKline and Manville both shine with tragically wrenching performances that sell the all-consuming hopelessness Jonathan\u2019s death brought into the Brigstockes\u2019 lives. But Disclaimer truly revolves around Blanchett and George, whose two iterations of Catherine feel subtly distinct at first blush, yet uncannily similar as the series\u2019 seven episodes unfold. You\u2019re meant to wonder how much of the gap between present-day Catherine\u2019s steeliness and her past self\u2019s ethereal airiness is just a function of time changing people or whether that difference speaks to something more sinister that she\u2019s desperately trying to keep hidden.\n\nThe largeness with which sex looms in Disclaimer\u2019s story makes the show feel distinct among Apple TV Plus\u2019 other recent offerings. But rather than existing just to titillate you, Cuar\u00f3n uses the show\u2019s erotic edge to make a point about the danger of becoming fixated on the intimate details of other people\u2019s lives. You\u2019re supposed to gawk at Jonathan and Cather\u2019s dalliances in the past the same way everyone who comes into possession of \u201cThe Perfect Stranger\u201d finds themselves poring over the book\u2019s contents.\n\nConclusions are meant to be drawn from the way Disclaimer shows you who Catherine and Jonathan were to each other because Cuar\u00f3n is trying to get you, like his characters, to build a story about them in your mind. But by the series\u2019 final episode, Disclaimer\u2019s drama metamorphizes in a way that\u2019s designed to leave you reeling and thinking about how malleable the truth can really be.",

Beyond navigating our current environment, restoring our company requires tough decisions and we will have to make structural changes to ensure we can stay competitive and deliver for our customers over the long term.\n\nWe need to be clear-eyed about the work we face and realistic about the time it will take to achieve key milestones on the path to recovery. We also need to focus our resources on performing and innovating in the areas that are core to who we are, rather than spreading ourselves across too many efforts that can often result in underperformance and underinvestment.\n\nWith that in mind, today I am sharing some difficult decisions and several program updates:\n\nOn the 777X program, the challenges we have faced in development, as well as from the flight test pause and ongoing work stoppage, will delay our program timeline. We have notified customers that we now expect first delivery in 2026.\n\nWe plan to build and deliver the remaining 767 Freighters ordered by our customers and then conclude production of the commercial program in 2027. Production for the KC-46A Tanker will continue.\n\nIn BDS, our performance on fixed-price development programs is simply not where it needs to be. We expect substantial new losses in BDS this quarter, driven by the work stoppage on commercial derivatives, continued program challenges and our decision to complete production on the 767 freighter. I will be providing additional oversight of this business and these programs.\n\nAlong with the above actions, we must also reset our workforce levels to align with our financial reality and to a more focused set of priorities. Over the coming months, we are planning to reduce the size of our total workforce by roughly 10 percent. These reductions will include executives, managers and employees. Next week, your leadership team will share more tailored information about what this means for your organization. Based on this decision, we will not proceed with the next cycle of furloughs.\n\nAs we move through this process, we will maintain our steadfast focus on safety, quality and delivering for our customers. We know these decisions will cause difficulty for you, your families and our team, and I sincerely wish we could avoid taking them. However, the state of our business and our future recovery require tough actions.\n\nWe will be transparent with you regarding the timing and impact of these steps, and we will be professional and supportive to everyone along the way.\n\nThank you for all that you are doing through this very challenging time at Boeing. We will navigate through this moment. We will re-focus our company, and we will restore trust with all those who depend on us.\n\nKelly",

        "title": "Adobe\u2019s AI video model is here, and it\u2019s already inside Premiere Pro",
        "text": "Adobe is making the jump into generative AI video. The company\u2019s Firefly Video Model, which has been teased since earlier this year, is launching today across a handful of new tools, including some right inside Premiere Pro that will allow creatives to extend footage and generate video from still images and text prompts.\n\nThe first tool \u2014 Generative Extend \u2014 is launching in beta for Premiere Pro. It can be used to extend the end or beginning of footage that\u2019s slightly too short, or make adjustments mid-shot, such as to correct shifting eye-lines or unexpected movement.\n\nClips can only be extended by two seconds, so Generative Extend is only really suitable for small tweaks, but that could replace the need to retake footage to correct tiny issues. Extended clips can be generated at either 720p or 1080p at 24 FPS. It can also be used on audio to help smooth out edits, albeit with limitations. It\u2019ll extend sound effects and ambient \u201croom tone\u201d by up to ten seconds, for example, but not spoken dialog or music.\n\nThe new Generative Extend tool in Premiere Pro can fill gaps in footage that would ordinarily require a full reshoot, such as adding a few extra steps to this person walking next to a car. Image:Adobe\n\nTwo other video generation tools are launching on the web. Adobe\u2019s Text-to-Video and Image-to-Video tools, first announced in September, are now rolling out as a limited public beta in the Firefly web app.\n\nText-to-Video functions similarly to other video generators like Runway and OpenAI\u2019s Sora \u2014 users just need to plug in a text description for what they want to generate. It can emulate a variety of styles like regular \u201creal\u201d film, 3D animation, and stop motion, and the generated clips can be further refined using a selection of \u201ccamera controls\u201d that simulate things like camera angles, motion, and shooting distance.\n\nThis is what some of the camera control options look like to adjust the generated output. Image: Adobe\n\nImage-to-Video goes a step further by letting users add a reference image alongside a text prompt to provide more control over the results. Adobe suggests this could be used to make b-roll from images and photographs, or help visualize reshoots by uploading a still from an existing video. The before and after example below shows this isn\u2019t really capable of replacing reshoots directly, however, as several errors like wobbling cables and shifting backgrounds are visible in the results.\n\nHere\u2019s the original clip... Video: Adobe\n\n...and this is what it looks like Image-to-Video \u2018remakes\u2019 the footage. Notice how the yellow cable is wobbling for no reason? Video: Adobe\n\nYou won\u2019t be making entire movies with this tech any time soon, either. The maximum length of Text-to-Video and Image-to-Video clips is currently five seconds, and the quality tops out at 720p and 24 frames per second. By comparison, OpenAI says that Sora can generate videos up to a minute long \u201cwhile maintaining visual quality and adherence to the user\u2019s prompt\u201d \u2014 but that\u2019s not available to the public yet despite being announced months before Adobe\u2019s tools.\n\nThe model is restricted to producing clips that are around four seconds long, like this example of an AI-generated baby dragon scrambling around in magma. Video: Adobe\n\nText-to-Video, Image-to-Video, and Generative Extend all take about 90 seconds to generate, but Adobe says it\u2019s working on a \u201cturbo mode\u201d to cut that down. And restricted as it may be, Adobe says its tools powered by its AI video model are \u201ccommercially safe\u201d because they\u2019re trained on content that the creative software giant was permitted to use. Given models from other providers like Runway are being scrutinized for allegedly being trained on thousands of scraped YouTube videos \u2014 or in Meta\u2019s case, maybe even your personal videos \u2014 commercial viability could be a deal cincher for some users.\n\nOne other benefit is that videos created or edited using Adobe\u2019s Firefly video model can be embedded with Content Credentials to help disclose AI usage and ownership rights when published online. It\u2019s not clear when these tools will be out of beta, but at least they\u2019re publicly available \u2014 which is more than we can say for OpenAI\u2019s Sora, Meta\u2019s Movie Gen, and Google\u2019s Veo generators.",

Almost seven minutes following liftoff, the Super Heavy booster returned to its launchpad, where the launch tower caught it using arms that SpaceX has nicknamed the \u201cchopsticks.\u201d\n\nThe remarkable catch was a first for SpaceX and an important step toward making the Super Heavy booster a fully reusable launch system just like SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 rockets. The booster completed a similar set of maneuvers to today\u2019s during its previous flight test in June, when it splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico, instead.\n\nSpaceX\u2019s South Texas launch tower catches the Super Heavy booster. GIF: SpaceX Starship livestream.\n\nToday\u2019s flight test, which was delayed 25 minutes while SpaceX waited for its launch range to be cleared of boats, marks the second full Starship launch, flight, and return to Earth. The craft reentered the Earth\u2019s atmosphere about 45 minutes after liftoff and carried out a \u201csoft\u201d splashdown in the Indian Ocean at 9:30AM ET.

The company used new heat shielding tiles and added an extra backup ablative layer, as ArsTechnica described last week.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) gave SpaceX approval for the test flight only yesterday. It had originally expected to clear this launch next month, but the FAA and its partner agencies reportedly carried out their assessments of SpaceX\u2019s preparations faster than anticipated.",

        "text": "Lawsuits take a long time, and so there\u2019s no good reason to believe that Google as we know it will be gone anytime soon. But as the antitrust fight against the company continues, and Google\u2019s losses mount, it\u2019s also starting to seem like Google as we know also won\u2019t be around forever. In one case, the Play Store is being opened up; in another, the government says it might try to force Chrome and Android out of Google.\n\nOn this episode of The Vergecast, The Verge\u2019s Lauren Feiner takes us through all the latest movements in the many cases against Google, and what she\u2019s hearing about how the government and the company are preparing for the future.\n\nBut before we get to that, we do some wild Tesla speculating. Because you\u2019ve now seen the Cybercab reveal, and so have we, but when we recorded this show on Thursday afternoon all we had was years of teases and some educated guesses about what might be coming. Nilay and David both have some predictions, and you can score us now that we know the truth. (Unfortunately, it appears Nilay won.)\n\nWe also have lots of gadget news to discuss, from Nintendo\u2019s adorable and slightly confusing new Alarmo alarm clock to the latest reports on Apple\u2019s next iPads and Macs. We\u2019re nearing the end of gadget-launch season, as we wind toward the holidays, but it appears we\u2019re not done yet.\n\nFinally, we do a lightning round, in which we have big plans for Google Docs tabs, serious worries about the state of content moderation in this year\u2019s hurricane season, and a lot of questions about why you\u2019d need an AI avatar on Zoom.\n\nIf you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, here are some links to get you started, first on Tesla:\n\nAnd on the week\u2019s gadget news:\n\nAnd in Google antitrust news:",

        "text": "The Vergecast is the flagship podcast from The Verge about small gadgets, Big Tech, and everything in between. Every Friday, hosts Nilay Patel, David Pierce, and Alex Cranz hang out and make sense of the week\u2019s most important technology news. And every Tuesday, David leads a selection of The Verge\u2019s expert staffers in an exploration of how gadgets and software affect our lives \u2013 and which ones you should bring into yours.\n\nDecoder is a new show from The Verge about big ideas \u2014 and other problems. Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel talks to a diverse cast of innovators and policymakers at the frontiers of business and technology to reveal how they\u2019re navigating an ever-changing landscape, what keeps them up at night, and what it all means for our shared future.\n\nBig tech is transforming every aspect of our world. But how? And at what cost? In the latest season of Land of the Giants: The Facebook/ Meta Disruption, Recode senior reporter Shirin Ghaffary and The Verge deputy editor Alex Heath bring us inside the company that\u2019s determined how the world interacts and communicates online. How has Meta shaped our relationships, and what\u2019s in store for us as the company undergoes an unprecedented transition? New episodes are every Wednesday starting July 13th. From Recode, The Verge, and the Vox Media Podcast Network.\n\nHosted by The Verge\u2019s Ashley Carman and Vox.com\u2019s Kaitlyn Tiffany, Why\u2019d You Push That Button is a podcast about the choices technology forces us to make, featuring interviews with consumers, developers, friends, and strangers. It asks the hard, weird, occasionally dumb questions about how your tiny tech decisions impact your social life, like swiping on dating apps, leaving negative restaurant reviews, or indiscriminately liking celebrity photos on Instagram.\n\nAn experimental podcast by The Verge that explores new, fun, and interesting ways to entertain with audio. Featuring mini-series shows such as Pirate Radio, Better Worlds, and more.\n\nThis is Converge, a conversational game show hosted by Casey Newton. Each week, one of the tech industry\u2019s most fascinating entrepreneurs steps into the hot seat to play a series of tailor-made games that are funny and revealing.\n\nEnjoy the archives of this series featuring legendary technology columnist Walt Mossberg and The Verge\u2019s editor-in-chief Nilay Patel. The series finale aired on June 13, 2017, shortly before Walt\u2019s well-deserved retirement.",

(If you\u2019re new here, welcome, so psyched you found us, and also you can read all the old editions at the Installer homepage.)\n\nI also have for you the coolest alarm clock I can remember, a splashy new Bitcoin documentary, a new monster-taming game people love, a tiny but amazing Google Docs update, and much more. Not the busiest and most exciting week of all time, if I\u2019m honest, but still lots of fun stuff to get to. Let\u2019s do it.\n\n(As always, the best part of Installer is your ideas and tips.

She\u2019s a reviews editor here at The Verge and also does a ton of work on how-tos and roundups and helping tell everyone about all the best technology everywhere. (She recently turned me back onto UpNote, just to name one \u2014 and she\u2019s right, it\u2019s delightful.)\n\nSo Barbara tries everything, but what does she actually use? I asked her to share her homescreen to find out. Here it is, plus some info on the apps she uses and why:\n\nThe phone: It\u2019s a Pixel 6. I know this may go against the tech enthusiast philosophy of \u201cthe latest and greatest,\u201d but I tend to hold on to my phones as long as they work (or break \u2014 I\u2019ve been known to drop one or two). I believe that Android 15 will be its last OS update, so I\u2019ll probably have to bite the bullet and get a new phone next year when Android 16 shows up.\n\nThe wallpaper: This is a photo I took last year in Owego, New York, where a very close friend grew up. It\u2019s the Susquehanna River at sunset.\n\nThe apps: Maps, Contacts, Google Voice, Slack, Chrome, Google Home, Google Photos, Google Drive, Files, Google Play Store, Phone, Messages, Gmail, Camera, Assistant.\n\nThe icon labeled \u201cLISTEN\u201d goes to a webpage with a recording of Bob Fosse directing Liza Minnelli in the original Broadway production of Chicago, which gives you some idea of the kind of theater nerd I am.\n\nThe second screen has all the other apps that I use on a day-to-day basis, divided into groups. (Or used to use \u2014 there are some there that I haven\u2019t opened for a long time and really need to delete.) The Tody app was supposed to motivate me to clean my home, but unfortunately, it hasn\u2019t worked as well as I\u2019d hoped. Smart Tools is a bunch of handy apps (like a mirror, a ruler, and a distance calculator) in one neat package.\n\nI\u2019ve got one more screen that has apps I\u2019m currently experimenting with, but that can change on a day-to-day basis, so I don\u2019t think it counts.\n\nI also asked Barbara to share a few things she\u2019s into right now. Here\u2019s what she sent back:\n\nCurrent media obsessions include Agatha All Along , The Great British Bake Off , and rewatching Doctor Who . We\u2019re just finishing the Peter Capaldi era and haven\u2019t yet decided whether to proceed to the Jodie Whittaker era or go back to one of the old Whos, like Tom Baker. I\u2019m really eager to see the latest season of Slow Horses . I read the book it was based on a couple of months ago, but we don\u2019t currently subscribe to Apple TV Plus, so I\u2019ll have to wait.\n\n, , and rewatching .

Grossman is on my long list of favorite authors, and this is a great example of his skill. I\u2019m not much of a gaming person, but I have been battling two friends for several years on Words With Friends 2 \u2014 we\u2019re pretty much equally matched. And I love crossword puzzles, Wordle , etc. So I guess I\u2019ll have to adjust that to say I\u2019m a word gaming person.\n\n\u2014 we\u2019re pretty much equally matched.

Not the greatest experience, because it uses a modern Hasidic pronunciation that is much different than the older Eastern European dialect I grew up with. Still, I\u2019m pushing ahead with it.\n\nCrowdsourced\n\nHere\u2019s what the Installer community is into this week. I want to know what you\u2019re into right now as well! Email installer@theverge.com or message me on Signal \u2014 @davidpierce.11 \u2014 with your recommendations for anything and everything, and we\u2019ll feature some of our favorites here every week. For even more great recommendations, check out the replies to this post on Threads.\n\n\u201cReading Jason Pargin\u2019s I\u2019m Starting to Worry About This Black Box of Doom. A dark, funny commentary on modern culture.\u201d \u2013 Matthew\n\n\u201cStrudel. I\u2019ve used a lot of live-coding languages and frameworks, but so far, this one has worked the best for me. It\u2019s a really fun and immediate way of making music compared to a traditional DAW. It has nothing to do with generative AI, it\u2019s not just a prompt engine, it\u2019s basically just another interface for doing what you\u2019d normally do with Ableton or whatever.\u201d \u2013 Tom\n\n\u201cI recently stopped using TickTick, as I\u2019ve been trying to reduce my subscriptions. I wanted to try living off of Apple Reminders. I feel like it\u2019s 90 percent of the way there. Luckily, for the last 10 percent, I think I found the perfect app with GoodTask! It\u2019s only for Apple devices, but it basically supercharges Reminders by adding stuff like customization, a better interface, and a calendar. Best of all, it\u2019s a one-time purchase of $10!\u201d \u2013 John\n\n\u201cI picked up the Native Union (Re)Classic Case for my iPhone 16 Pro, and this thing is nice.\u201d \u2013 Joe\n\n\u201cSuperlocal Maps has been a lot of fun and really useful. My favorite feature is Fog of World, which keeps track of where you have and haven\u2019t \u2018discovered\u2019 in the world, similar to discovering locations in games like Fortnite but in the real world. Outside of that, it\u2019s got some really cool Perplexity / ChatGPT-like search capabilities for finding places near you, e.g., \u2018What are some coffee shops nearby that have free Wi-Fi?\u2019 or \u2018What are some dog-friendly parks I can visit in Sydney?\u2019\u201d \u2013 Harry\n\n\u201cThe new 3-in-1 Ninja Luxe espresso machine has been keeping me overcaffeinated. Weight-based dosing ensures your beans are consistently ground, it evaluates the shots you pull to recommend changes to grind size, and the automated frother makes it easy to get right, too. Great for someone like me who cares about their coffee but isn\u2019t overly fussy about it.\u201d \u2013 Scott\n\n\u201cI was looking for a good idle / incremental game to play in down moments, and Idle Iktah has totally fit the bill. I can enjoy mobile games a bit too much sometimes and have to be cautious about getting caught in addictive gameplay loops. Iktah is right in the sweet spot of engaging but not consuming, with charming PNW-inspired pixel art.\u201d \u2013 Emmett\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s native apps have gotten good enough to be your main productivity stack. Forever Notes is an elegant and fresh look at configuring Apple Notes as a sophisticated note program. As a longtime and happy Obsidian user, I\u2019m impressed with how well this configuration works. It\u2019s also very well documented and supported.\u201d \u2013 Jim\n\n\u201cI am an old paying Overcast user and can confirm that the new Swift version is finally working fine.\u201d \u2013 Gabriel\n\nSigning off\n\nI have to admit something: I have become a spreadsheet person. I\u2019ve avoided Excel, Google Sheets, and anything else that looks like rows and columns for as long as I can remember, but over the course of this year, I\u2019ve worked on an unusual number of big team projects \u2014 the sort that require a lot of people to know what\u2019s going on at any given time \u2014 and man, you just can\u2019t beat the efficiency of a good spreadsheet. I\u2019m barely scratching the surface, features-wise, but I\u2019m hooked on how easy it is to build a calendar, a project tracker, or just a good ol\u2019 budget system in a spreadsheet. Who needs awesome optimized apps! Give me rows and columns! I hate that I\u2019ve become this person, but I fear there\u2019s no going back.\n\nAlso, and I mean this: Send me your awesome-est spreadsheet tips. I am going to be unstoppable.",

As I see it, his only real politics are: Elon Musk should get to do whatever he wants, forever. And his latest political outbursts strike me as being clearly connected to his money. He\u2019s come to the same conclusion as Donald Trump, which is that it\u2019s particularly easy to grift Republican voters, and there are lots of rewards and very few consequences for doing so. Donny, these men are nihilists.\n\nOn the face of it, it might look stupid for a businessman to alienate one of the major US political parties. Musk has a long history of taking subsidies from local, state, and federal governments. His business SpaceX is built essentially on agency contracts in the heavily regulated aerospace industry. But I\u2019m guessing Musk has figured out he can leverage the culture wars to his advantage.\n\nThose of you familiar with SpaceX may recall its litany of lawsuits against the government. For instance, in 2005, the company alleged that Boeing and Lockheed Martin had engaged in anticompetitive behavior meant to keep SpaceX from letting its Falcon 9 compete in government contracts. (The Falcon 9 didn\u2019t have its first launch until 2010.)\n\nAnd in 2014, Musk sued the US Air Force over a $11 billion sole-source contract awarded to the United Launch Alliance. (The Falcon Heavy wouldn\u2019t have its first launch until 2018.) SpaceX got concessions, dropping the suit after the Air Force agreed to speed up its efforts to certify SpaceX to launch military satellites \u2014 and making more launches available for SpaceX to compete on.\n\nThese suits got Musk what he wanted\n\nNow I personally, as a woman familiar with the linear concept of time, find these suits odd. How could SpaceX compete using a rocket it hadn\u2019t yet launched? Sure, the \u201cindefinite delivery / indeterminate quantity\u201d contracts existed for the Falcon I, but that wasn\u2019t what SpaceX was suing over. And yet, these suits got Musk what he wanted: more possible government contracts. In fact, such suits have been as much a hallmark of SpaceX as its rockets.\n\nIf you are the kind of person who uses lawsuits to get what you want, you may have made note of the fact that Donald Trump appointed 200 federal judges, including \u201cnearly as many powerful federal appeals court judges in four years as Barack Obama appointed in eight,\u201d as Pew Research puts it. In 2021, more than a quarter of active federal judges were Trump appointees. Let\u2019s not pretend that\u2019s insignificant; if it were, the Federalist Society wouldn\u2019t exist. If Musk supports Republicans, they\u2019ll keep appointing judges who believe things that favor Musk \u2014 and he might even get lucky and get some blatantly partisan judges, who\u2019d support him because of his affiliation.\n\nConsider Texas, which has taken a real interest in Musk\u2019s affairs. During Musk\u2019s Twitter acquisition, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced an investigation of Twitter bot numbers \u2014 an investigation that neatly aligned with the argument Musk was making to try to get out of buying the social media company. Of course, there\u2019s also the Texas judge who owned Tesla stock and greenlit a Musk-backed lawsuit against Media Matters for America. (The judge in question is known for his politically conservative rulings.)\n\nBut wait! There\u2019s more. In 2020, SpaceX was awarded almost $900 million in rural broadband subsidies from the FCC under Trump. But in 2022, the Biden-era FCC rescinded that funding since \u201cthe applicant had failed to meet its burden.\u201d Two Republican FCC commissioners objected, and now a Republican House Oversight Committee chair is probing the FCC\u2019s decision.\n\nDoes this sound cynical? I suppose\n\nCulture war issues are meant to motivate a largely apathetic voter base that doesn\u2019t especially give a shit about government appropriations. They have been used historically by Republicans, starting with Barry Goldwater, in order to enact specific financial policies that have largely hurt lower-class Americans. It seems Musk has paid enough attention to this particular historical quirk to decide the culture war can help him, too.\n\nDoes this sound cynical? I suppose. Sincere, coherent political beliefs are largely the province of the bourgeoisie and nerds who paid attention in government class. The Elon Musks of the world are interested in power. Not everything Musk says is necessarily calculated or politically beneficial \u2014 his partisan allegiances have also extended to having friendly conversations with mask-off white nationalists and reposting theories that women are incapable of thought. Crucially, however, there are no negative consequences for these actions \u2014 only more attention, which seems to be his personal heroin.\n\nConsider the rocket situation. For NASA, Musk is the only game in town besides Boeing, and he knows it. He also knows that even if he publicly misbehaves \u2014 smokes weed, for instance \u2014 NASA will do nothing punitive. And I do blame the brain geniuses at NASA. Instead of having in-house rockets for launching our spy satellites, we\u2019re now dependent on Boeing (lol, lmao), the United Launch Alliance (a joint venture that includes\u2026 Boeing), and SpaceX. (Sure, Jeff Bezos\u2019 also-ran Blue Origin exists, I guess, but come on.) By outsourcing its engineering, NASA put the national security apparatus at the whims of contractors gone wild.\n\nAnd Musk\u2019s gamble appears to be that being a visible Republican will benefit him more than being neutral, presumably because he assumes, probably correctly, that Democrats won\u2019t punish him for this. So when it comes to, let\u2019s say, SpaceX\u2019s environmental damage, the safety record of Tesla\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving,\u201d and working conditions for his employees, aligning with Republicans lets him suggest any examination of his behavior is politically motivated. Convenient, isn\u2019t it?\n\nYou can see the ambition even with the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. By courting the right, as he has unquestionably done, he has attempted to create a value proposition for a company he has largely destroyed. The skew also gives him an excuse: if X dies, Musk can claim it wasn\u2019t because it was mismanaged but destroyed by the radical left or whatever. Thanks to his friendly judges, he can even take those \u201cradical left\u201d critics to the cleaners in court!",

        "title": "The portable PlayStations were Sony at its most ambitious",
        "text": "As we mark 25 years of PlayStation this week, Sony\u2019s grip on the home console market has rarely been stronger. The PS4 recently outsold the original PlayStation to become the second bestselling version yet behind the PS2, which will likely never be matched. It augurs well for the upcoming launch of the PS5. One part of the PlayStation story that is often overlooked, however, is Sony\u2019s efforts with handhelds. You probably know the broad strokes: the PSP was overshadowed by the hugely popular Nintendo DS, while the PS Vita never took off at all. And now we have the Switch.\n\nBut it would be unfair to write off Sony\u2019s travails in the portable gaming industry. The PSP and Vita were not only innovative devices in their own right, but the most daunting competitors Nintendo ever faced in the handheld space. They\u2019re more than just a footnote in the PlayStation story.\n\nThe idea of a portable PlayStation was something that seemed inevitable as soon as it was clear that Sony was serious about games. While the original PlayStation comprehensively outsold the Nintendo 64 around the globe, the Game Boy essentially had the handheld market to itself during that time, so it was only natural to wonder what the new home console leader would be able to put in your pocket.\n\nIn Japan, at least, Sony had an answer right away: the PocketStation. In truth, this tiny gadget didn\u2019t really count as a console \u2014 it was technologically closer to a Tamagotchi or the Dreamcast\u2019s Visual Memory Unit than a Game Boy. It was also never released outside of Japan. But with its cute, low-res mini-games that connected to popular original PlayStation titles like Final Fantasy VIII and Street Fighter Alpha 3, the PocketStation was an early sign that Sony saw the potential in taking the PlayStation outside the home.\n\nPhoto by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\n\nThe real bombshell dropped just ahead of E3 2003, when Sony announced the PlayStation Portable, or PSP. Although it wasn\u2019t set for release until the following year, with many technical details left unclear, Sony Computer Entertainment president and CEO Ken Kutaragi\u2019s description of the device as \u201cthe Walkman of the 21st century\u201d served as an appropriate statement of intent. The news that the PSP would use a 480 x 272 widescreen LCD and a new 1.8-inch \u201cUMD\u201d optical disc format was enough to get people excited about what the PSP could do. This was clearly going to be leaps beyond the Game Boy Advance.\n\nWhen the PSP was revealed in full in 2004, its success seemed like a foregone conclusion, particularly as Nintendo\u2019s new competing device was so unconventional. The PSP had a high-resolution widescreen display, incredible graphics, multimedia capabilities, and an ultra-sleek industrial design. The DS, meanwhile, had two low-res screens, PS1-level graphics, archaic software, and looked like a communicator from Battlestar Galactica.\n\nThe PSP\u2019s success seemed like a foregone conclusion\n\nThe gap between the two devices was most starkly illustrated by their respective Ridge Racer games, which were both released around each system\u2019s launch. Ridge Racer DS was a port of Ridge Racer 64 with janky graphics and unconvincing touchscreen controls. The PSP Ridge Racer, however, was a total reboot of the franchise with visuals that seemed impossible for a handheld system at the time. The comparison did not do Nintendo any favors.\n\nThe play for the high end of the market sounds like it would have been an obvious move for Sony, but in truth it was out of step with the company\u2019s moves in the gaming industry to date. The Nintendo 64 certainly had bigger numbers to throw around on paper than the PS1, for example, while the PS2\u2019s inferior specs didn\u2019t stop it from steamrolling the Xbox and the GameCube. But with the PSP, Sony saw a broader opportunity in mainstream consumer electronics.\n\n\u201cIt has gaming at its core, but it\u2019s not a gaming device. It\u2019s an entertainment device,\u201d Kaz Hirai, Sony Computer Entertainment America head (and eventual Sony CEO), told CBS upon the PSP\u2019s launch. In a classic Sony move, the company attempted to use the PSP to push sales of UMD movies that would only play on the console, even though they cost around the same as more versatile, better quality DVDs. The PSP was also a vehicle for Memory Stick Pro Duo, the doomed proprietary SD card competitor.\n\nThe PSP was everything that Sony claimed it would be (except perhaps a wireless wing mirror for a Formula One PS3 game, as was prematurely announced in 2006), and that\u2019s ultimately why it lost out to the DS. Despite vastly inferior silicon, Nintendo turned the DS into one of the most popular video game systems of all time with software that made clever use of the touchscreen, a battery that lasted far longer, and flash-based media that made more sense for portable scenarios. Yes, the PSP\u2019s UMD drive allowed for more expansive games\u2026 and yet another failed physical media format from Sony. The trade-off was that the PSP got much worse battery life than the DS, its games could take forever to load, and they often weren\u2019t well-suited to portable play when they did.\n\nPhoto by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\n\nStill, the PSP was a great device with lots of fantastic games, and it reportedly sold more than 80 million units, a figure that puts it over the 3DS to date. It might not have been a winner, but it certainly wasn\u2019t a failure. And when Sony started to think about a successor, it didn\u2019t stray too far away from the PSP\u2019s blueprint.\n\n2011\u2019s PS Vita was another full-throttle attempt to create the most powerful practical gaming handheld possible for its time. Just as the PSP could kinda-sorta be a PS2 in your hands, the Vita was kinda-sorta like a portable PS3. Its flagship launch title was a reasonably faithful Uncharted spinoff, just to prove the point.\n\nSony also addressed some of the PSP\u2019s most obvious flaws with the Vita. It had a second analog stick, which made modern action games viable; physical games switched from optical media to proprietary flash cards, which improved performance and staved off piracy for a while; and the screen was updated to a five-inch 960 \u00d7 544 non-Pentile OLED panel, which was bigger and better than anything you\u2019d find on pretty much any phone at the time. There were some features that turned out to be mostly useless, like the rear touchpad and an incomprehensible social network app, but the Vita hardware was overall very impressive.\n\nSony\u2019s technical advantage was quickly lost to phones\n\nUnfortunately, the software never caught up. Beyond the launch flurry, Sony barely supported the Vita with high-profile first-party titles, and sales were never strong enough for third-party publishers to lend significant support. By the time Sony released its first and last revision to the Vita hardware in 2013, the platform had essentially settled into its niche as a really great portable indie game machine and PS4 Remote Play controller.\n\nIn hindsight, when the games industry was worried about what mobile gaming might do to traditional consoles around the turn of the decade, it only really applied to Sony portables in the end. Their extra features became redundant next to smartphones; popular genres shifted to commute-friendly free gacha titles; and Sony\u2019s technical advantage was quickly lost to phones that got better and faster every year.\n\nThe PlayStation 4, on the other hand, outshone expectations and proved the relevance of dedicated console hardware. Nintendo handhelds never lost their appeal, meanwhile, but the leap in mobile capabilities and the failure of the Wii U opened the door for the company to push the envelope with the Switch. The new Switch Lite is, to all intents and purposes, a Vita done right.\n\nCouldn\u2019t Sony make a Switch-like console? Sure, but it\u2019s hard to see how it\u2019d play to Sony\u2019s strengths more than the Switch does to Nintendo\u2019s. It couldn\u2019t be much more powerful, and it wouldn\u2019t be compatible with games for the PS5, which Sony obviously wants you to hook up to your TV. It\u2019s hard to see how it wouldn\u2019t turn out like the Vita.\n\nThis is sad to say because of how impressive Sony\u2019s handhelds were in their day. But perhaps, after these two and a half decades of Sony and Nintendo trading blows, each company has arrived at its most natural position. Nintendo is so focused on making the best portable console possible that it\u2019s supplanted its own home console business altogether with a simple USB-C dock, while Sony has achieved great success with the PS4 simply by focusing on games. It\u2019s hard to see either company straying too far from its path any time soon.\n\nBut the PSP in particular is a meaningful part of gaming history that deserves to be remembered. Without it, we wouldn\u2019t have Lumines, Monster Hunter as an extant series, Metal Gear Acid, Persona 3 Portable, LocoRoco, Wipeout Pure and Pulse, two then-mindblowing Grand Theft Auto games, Jeanne d\u2019Arc, Patapon, and I really could go on with this list but I won\u2019t.

        "title": "Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn on AI, gamification, and the power of freemium",
        "text": "Today, I\u2019m talking with Luis von Ahn, the cofounder and CEO of Duolingo, the popular app that teaches languages. It\u2019s an interesting time to be in the language business: if there\u2019s anything the current state of AI tech can do, it\u2019s babble away in different languages with people who aren\u2019t quite fluent in what they\u2019re hearing.\n\nThat means there are lots of opportunities to enhance a product like Duolingo with AI, and Luis and I talked about the new features in something called Duolingo Max, which offers chat conversations with some characters and even video calls with an AI avatar named Lily.\n\nI wanted to talk about all of that, but I also wanted to talk to Luis about learning generally. If you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ve stopped and started using Duolingo several times; if you\u2019re an overachiever, you\u2019ve got a streak going and might even have a streak to maintain today. That streak is the key, and you\u2019ll hear Luis come back to that as a big idea several times.\n\nListen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge\u2019s Nilay Patel about big ideas \u2014 and other problems. Subscribe here!\n\nEngagement is the key, he says, because simply showing up is the cornerstone of actually making progress with language learning. You can\u2019t teach someone who isn\u2019t there, so over time, Duolingo has become more and more of a game, because people like to play games.\n\nBut there are real conflicts between gamification and actual learning. Luis is happy to admit that that conflict exists, and he\u2019s given it a lot of thought. For him, the gamification is the important part because not only does it bring you back to Duolingo, keeping the business humming along nicely, but he says it also produces the results in language proficiency that Duolingo is aiming for.\n\nLuis got pretty deep into explaining where the money comes from. As you might guess, it\u2019s from iPhone users in wealthier countries like the United States. And some technical decisions Duolingo made very early on mean the iOS version takes priority \u2014 it can take a year or more for features to roll out on the Android version of the app.\n\nBut Duolingo is a global product, where the biggest chunk of learners are actually trying to learn English \u2014 and those users are way more likely to use an Android phone and to want or need a free version of the product. There are a lot of tensions here, and you\u2019ll hear Luis talk about his own childhood in a poorer country and how that informs his decisions.\n\nThis is a good one \u2014 Luis is the founder, and he\u2019s helped the company to go public and now is helping it to embrace a pretty big technology shift. AI has a direct impact on the product he makes, and we talked about it all in a pretty direct way, with only a handful of jokes about founder mode. And of course, I asked him whether he approves of all the unhinged things the Duolingo owl says on social media.\n\nOkay, Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn. Here we go.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nLuis von Ahn, you are the CEO and cofounder of Duolingo. Welcome to Decoder.\n\nThank you for having me.\n\nI often start by asking CEOs what their company is, but I feel like everybody knows what Duolingo is. How do you define Duolingo?\n\nIt\u2019s an app that teaches languages. That\u2019s what we\u2019re mostly known for. As of the last couple of years, we have also taught math and music. It\u2019s the most popular way to learn languages in the world. A fun fact: there are more people learning languages on Duolingo in the US than in all US high schools combined. This is true in most countries in the world. We teach languages to more people than the public school systems.\n\nYou have some big announcements coming up at Duocon that will be public by the time this episode airs. One of them is the ability to chat with characters like Lily and others.\n\nYes, the ability to video call with Lily.\n\nHow does that work? How are you making that happen?\n\nWe have this cast of characters that our users love. One of them is an emo teen with purple hair who is very unimpressed by you. You can talk to her now and practice your conversation skills, and you can have really good conversations with her. There are a lot of things that are amazing about her. First of all, she adapts to your level \u2014 we know your level because you\u2019ve been learning on Duolingo, so we have a pretty good idea of what your level is.\n\nThe other thing is that she has memory, so she remembers the last time you talked about something. For example, I just had a conversation today where she remembered that, last time, we talked about the fact that I like Nirvana. She was telling me that her favorite song is \u201cSmells Like Teen Spirit.\u201d\n\nEasy choice, I have to say.\n\nWe\u2019re dating ourselves on that one, but yes. These are pretty enjoyable conversations, and you get to practice your language. It\u2019s entirely spoken, and it just works really well. We\u2019re very happy because this is the first time that you think, \u201cWe really are not going to need humans for this.\u201d\n\nThe animations and stuff, are those stock animations? Are they loops? How does that work? Is it in real time?\n\nYes. It\u2019s animated in real time. We have a rig for her. We bought two animation studios in Detroit. This is why we have an office in Detroit. They\u2019ve done a really good job. Her mouth moves when she\u2019s speaking, and it\u2019s tied to what she\u2019s saying. She rolls her eyes at you.\n\nWhen you think about that investment \u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re going to start building rigs and animations for characters. We\u2019re going to do it all in real time\u201d \u2014 I\u2019m just coming back to cost. That\u2019s a big investment. Do you think that\u2019s going to make your existing users pay more money? Or is it going to get you new users?\n\nI think it\u2019s both. We see it as continuing to work on the app. There are a lot of places where we use a lot of animation, and we see it as continuing to work on the app. And generally, as we continue working on the app, we get more users and get more of them to pay.\n\nThe reason I ask that in this context specifically is that the economics of AI is just a series of question marks right now. I ask this of everybody who\u2019s making the investments. How do you see it coming out on the other end?\n\nFor this particular feature, I think it\u2019s an excellent use of large language models, and on our end, it\u2019s working pretty well.\n\nThe other big announcement you have is called Adventures. It sounds like a video game. What\u2019s going on there?\n\nThe way Duolingo works is that the homescreen is basically a path, and you\u2019re just doing lessons. Some of the lessons are now going to be this thing we call an \u201cadventure,\u201d which is really just one of those video games where you move characters around. What\u2019s cool about it is that you\u2019re learning how to solve real-world situations on Duolingo.\n\nFor example, it\u2019s like a little video game where you are one of the characters and you\u2019re told, \u201cOkay, go buy a pizza.\u201d You move and have to ask around, and then you ask some people, and they tell you, \u201cOh, the pizza place is over there.\u201d It\u2019s super fun and it helps you learn to navigate the real world. So we\u2019ve been working on that. What\u2019s cool about that feature is that all the scenarios were mostly generated by AI. In the past, that feature would\u2019ve taken a long time to scale, but we were able to scale it pretty quickly because of AI.\n\nI played with Duolingo this morning. I have a long and complicated history with trying to learn Hindi. It\u2019s free. I was using it for free today. How does the app make money?\n\nIt is free. You can use it entirely for free without ever having to pay. If you don\u2019t pay, you may have to see some ads, and we make money from the ads. But also, if you want to turn off the ads, you can pay to subscribe, and it turns off the ads and gives you some extra features. We also make money from the subscription, and actually, the majority of the revenue comes from the subscription.\n\nIs Duolingo profitable as a company?\n\nYes. As of relatively recently.\n\nI\u2019m curious about this. I hear about this split from almost everyone we talk to: we start out, we want to grow our base of users, ads help us do that. It helps us keep the product free. And then the real money is going to come when we add value and we add paid subscriptions. Particularly with advertising lately with app tracking transparency on Apple platforms, with the massive influx of inventory from all the other platforms in the world, it seems like ads are even harder to make money on than ever. Has that been the case for you?\n\nIt\u2019s probably true. Ads have never been a priority for us. I don\u2019t know the exact number, but it\u2019s something like 6 or 7 percent of our revenue comes from ads. For us, as long as they\u2019re there, they\u2019re a good reason for people to subscribe. But generally, we make about 80 percent of our revenue from subscriptions, even though, by the way, only a little under 10 percent of our monthly active users pay to subscribe. So 10 percent of our monthly active users give us more than 80 percent of our revenue.\n\nAnd all of that revenue is in languages? Or is math growing?\n\nThe majority is languages. Math and music are growing. We launched those about a year ago, so they\u2019re just getting started. It\u2019s overwhelmingly languages.\n\nWhat languages are the most popular?\n\nEnglish is the most popular by far. Forty-five percent of our active users are learning English. The second is Spanish, the third is French, and then there\u2019s a big drop-off after that.\n\nAre the majority of your users outside of the United States? Or are they inside the US?\n\nUS is about 20 percent of our users, and 80 percent are international.\n\nSo are 80 percent of your users trying to learn English?\n\nAbout 45 percent are trying to learn English. Within the international segment, they also want to learn other languages.\n\nThere are a lot of languages offered in the app, and it seems like one way you could allocate resources would be by saying, \u201cEnglish is the most popular, we\u2019re going to put the most resources there.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t feel like how the app works. How do you think about it?\n\nWe definitely do some of that. I was going to say we don\u2019t do it as much as we should, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case. We don\u2019t do it commensurately with the number of users because we would probably spend all of our resources on English, Spanish, and French. We spend the majority of our resources in the top eight languages to learn, and then we spend very little resources outside of that. The top eight are English, Spanish, and French. Then there is German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, I think, and Chinese.\n\nMandarin or Cantonese?\n\nMandarin. And after that, there really is a huge drop-off. For example, Arabic is a large language, but there are not that many people learning Arabic. So we do put some resources there, but it\u2019s much less than for the larger languages.\n\nHow do you think about that kind of demand? I open Duolingo, I look at it, I\u2019m like, \u201cI should probably learn some Cantonese.\u201d I think, \u201cMan, I should be much better at Hindi than I am.\u201d Those are real things that I think all the time. I imagine there are a lot of people in my particular diaspora who feel the same way. But that\u2019s latent demand. Do you ever go out and say to people, \u201cYou should learn some Spanish\u201d?\n\nWe don\u2019t.\n\nDo you ever say, \u201cWe should market Spanish in the American South\u201d?\n\nWe don\u2019t. We have remained neutral about that, but it is an interesting thing that demand for learning languages is not as correlated as you would like to see with the number of speakers or maybe even usefulness in a geopolitical world. For example, even though Chinese is one of our top eight languages to learn, only about 2 percent of our users are learning it. It\u2019s relatively small, even as the most spoken language in the world.\n\nOne of the things that goes into people\u2019s calculus is how hard a language is to learn. Chinese, at least for English speakers, is just a lot harder. We have data. To get to a pretty good point in Spanish for English speakers takes, call it, 300 to 400 hours. That same level of knowledge for Chinese takes about 2,000 hours. The reality is, in the United States, if you\u2019re just going for pragmatism, return on investment, Spanish is probably much better. In the US, you probably should learn Spanish. It\u2019s quite an easy language to learn.\n\nIn the US, you should probably learn Spanish. That is a marketing message.\n\nWell, we don\u2019t say that. We\u2019ve tried to remain neutral. We probably would get in trouble, or I would get in trouble inside the company, if we started pushing people on certain languages.\n\nMaybe not inside the app, but as a way to grow, as a way to capture new users. It seems like a lot of what Duolingo is right now is people know they should be multilingual or bilingual at least, and so Duolingo is there. But there\u2019s also a huge portion of the population, at least in this country, who are like, \u201cScrew it. I speak English.\u201d The idea that there\u2019s value in learning a second language is foreign to them.\n\nThere is, although I\u2019m very happy with our results in the US. Historically, there hasn\u2019t been a big desire to learn languages in the US and the UK. The thinking has been, \u201cYou can learn English. We are very happy.\u201d In the US, 80 percent of our users were not learning a language before Duolingo. We\u2019re growing the market in the US. It\u2019s the same number in the UK. I\u2019m very happy with that.\n\nI think back to learning French when I was in high school in Wisconsin. There\u2019s learning the language and then there\u2019s all of the culture that comes with a language, particularly some of the regional languages. High school French is a lot of looking at a picture of a baguette. It\u2019s totally foreign to whatever you\u2019re doing. Do you think about that, inside of Duolingo, that there\u2019s a huge cultural component here?\n\nWe do.\n\nThat\u2019s more investment, right?\n\nWe do, and we try to add the culture. We don\u2019t do it as much as maybe we should. We try to stick mostly with languages. It also depends on the language. Some languages are quite tight to the culture, and some are less so. Spanish is a good example. There are 20-some countries that speak Spanish, and some of them are pretty different than others. We do a little bit of culture, but we try not to be like, \u201cOh, you\u2019re learning Spanish. You\u2019re a Mexican person with a sombrero.\u201d We try not to do that. I mean, we also have to not be offensive. But we try to add it a little bit. I would say that it\u2019s not the primary goal.\n\nThe reason I ask that is that Duolingo is instantiated for most people as its mascot. We should talk about the mascot\u2019s personality and its social media presence, but it\u2019s fairly abstracted from a person teaching you the language. There\u2019s not someone on the other side that\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m teaching you this. Here\u2019s the culture that comes with it.\u201d You might have other teachers who might teach you in another way.\n\nThere\u2019s an abstraction there that just feels interesting, especially as we\u2019re obviously going to talk about AI and how you\u2019re using that and how you\u2019re expanding the platform. I want to push on that a little bit, that abstraction. Do you think it\u2019s resulting in people who\u2019ve learned a language or people who\u2019ve learned how to communicate?\n\nIt\u2019s been very much on purpose for us to not put humans in the app, as in human teachers. There\u2019s nothing wrong with human teachers. It\u2019s just the case that, from the beginning, we\u2019ve been a technology company, and we\u2019ve wanted to make it so that technology teaches you. There are a couple of reasons for that. One is that it\u2019s a lot cheaper to teach you with technology than with a human teacher.\n\nThe other thing is, somewhere between 80 and 90 percent of language learners don\u2019t want to talk to another human. They may tell you they do, but they don\u2019t. It\u2019s because when you\u2019re learning a language, you\u2019re pretty shy about it, and only the extreme extroverts are okay talking to a stranger on video in a language that they\u2019re not very good at. The majority of people won\u2019t do it.\n\nWe\u2019ve done research studies over the years because, over time, we thought maybe we should add humans. But these research studies are some of the most amazing things that I\u2019ve seen. When you talk to a user, you ask them, \u201cWhat do you think could make Duolingo better?\u201d Historically, in the past, they have said, \u201cWell, more practice conversation with a real person.\u201d They have said that. And then you ask the user, \u201cOkay, so you\u2019re telling me if I put a human on Duolingo, you would do that?\u201d And then they say, \u201cYes, I would.\u201d And you can even ask them, \u201cWould you pay for it?\u201d And then they\u2019ll say, \u201cYes, I\u2019ll pay for it.\u201d And then you tell them, \u201cOkay, do you want to do it right now?\u201d And the answer invariably is, \u201cNo, no, not right now.\u201d People just don\u2019t want to do that.\n\nThat\u2019s why we haven\u2019t put humans in, and I think it\u2019s been a good decision, especially now that we can do a pretty good job of getting you to practice conversation without a human with large language models.\n\nI want to ask about this because I\u2019ve been asking a lot of people on this show: what good are these large language models? What are the products you\u2019re going to make? I understand you\u2019re making the models, and it feels like Duolingo has a very natural solution, which is that you can talk to it and it\u2019ll talk back. It doesn\u2019t matter if everyone is hallucinating because all you\u2019re doing is practicing talking.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly right. It is a really good application. You said it. It doesn\u2019t matter if it says something that is a little wrong because you\u2019re just practicing your language. Also, it doesn\u2019t matter if it makes a small mistake. Sometimes it makes a small grammatical mistake. People don\u2019t even notice because they\u2019re usually beginners in Spanish or French. It also can adapt to your level really well. Large language models are really good at adapting to your level.\n\nSo we tell it, \u201cOkay, adapt to a beginner in Spanish.\u201d We even tell it, \u201cHey, because we\u2019ve seen this person learn on Duolingo, we actually know all the words they know.\u201d So we tell the language model, \u201cThis person only knows these 200 words, so please mostly use only these 200 words.\u201d It works really well for that.\n\nHow much investment into AI are you making? This is a new product. It\u2019s very costly. Everyone is telling me about how much the Nvidia GPUs cost. You said you\u2019ve only just become profitable. This feels like the thing that will immediately make you not profitable again as you invest in AI.\n\nWe\u2019re investing a lot. Fortunately, it\u2019s good for us in terms of profitability for two reasons. There are two places where we invest in AI. The first is generating data that is going to be used in our lessons. That data used to be generated partly with humans, and now it\u2019s mostly generated with AI, and it\u2019s a lot cheaper to generate with AI than with humans. It\u2019s also a lot faster to generate it with AI, so we\u2019re very happy with that.\n\nAnd then the other big use is real-time conversation. That one is expensive. It\u2019s expensive to provide a real-time conversation with a user, but what we had to do is add a higher-priced plan. We now have two subscription plans. We have Super Duolingo, which is our standard subscription, and we added a new one called Duolingo Max, which is about twice the price of Super Duolingo and gives you the conversation practice. It\u2019s expensive, but people pay twice as much, so it really doesn\u2019t cut into it. It\u2019s worked out well for us.\n\nLet me dive into the economics of that because, in general, I\u2019m fascinated by whether any of this will result in profitable, sustainable companies. There\u2019s a lot of money flowing into this. So, you charged twice the price to run inference. Is that someone else\u2019s large language model?\n\nYes, we use OpenAI.\n\nSo you\u2019re buying some capacity from OpenAI, you\u2019re buying some tokens from them, and you\u2019re reselling them to users for twice the price of your standard plan. What\u2019s your margin on that resale?\n\nI don\u2019t know the percentages off the top of my head, but I do know that it\u2019s good for us in terms of margins.\n\nThat\u2019s the thing I\u2019m curious about. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s good for OpenAI all the way at the bottom of that chain. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s profitable for them. But as you build products on this stuff, it seems like your economics depend on their economics, in some way, because you need to add a margin to that. That all seems very complicated and tenuous, especially if the AI features are what bring you new users.\n\nThe good news is, at the moment, the AI features are not bringing us new users.\n\nOr new revenue?\n\nYes, it is bringing us new revenue. There\u2019s a good margin there. So, for a number of reasons, the price of the same exact call is going down over time, whether you do it through an OpenAI or whether you do it through a Microsoft. Everything is getting more efficient, and chips are also getting cheaper over time. At the moment, there\u2019s a good amount of cushion, but we expect that there\u2019ll be an even larger amount of cushion over time. At least for our application, I\u2019m not particularly concerned in terms of margins. For our application, the margins work out pretty well.\n\nDo you think the models are somewhat interchangeable? This is a thing that I\u2019ve been hearing more and more is that the model business isn\u2019t the thing; the product business is the thing.\n\nI think the answer is yes, but the operative term is \u201csomewhat.\u201d They are \u201csomewhat\u201d interchangeable. We\u2019ve tried to build our technology stacks so that you can interchange them, but the reality is that you start getting wonky stuff because you probably spent a lot of time testing your way into the right queries. You may have done some fine-tuning. You can interchange them, but if you do, you probably need to spend a few months making sure that the wonkiness goes away.\n\nWhen you think about this investment over time, does it feel like you need to put the money in upfront and you\u2019ll get more efficient on the back end? Or does it feel like, \u201cOh, this is going to be the future of the company, so we need to rebuild around the capabilities of a large language model\u201d?\n\nIt\u2019s somewhere in between. I do think that large language models are going to be very positive for Duolingo \u2014 they already are, and I think they\u2019re going to continue being very positive. What is not true is that large language models solve all our problems. One of the biggest issues that people aren\u2019t talking about, particularly with education, is that large language models are good at teaching you stuff. They\u2019re not good at engagement. And that\u2019s the hardest thing with education.\n\nThe hardest thing about me trying to teach you something is just keeping you engaged. Somehow, people forget. I see some people saying, \u201cYou can learn quantum physics with ChatGPT.\u201d And yeah, sure, but that\u2019s just not that impressive. You can learn quantum physics with a book. The technology to learn that has been around for a long time. It\u2019s called a book and it works. It\u2019s just that people don\u2019t really want to read a quantum physics book. And similarly, most people probably don\u2019t want to go to ChatGPT and start asking questions about quantum physics. It\u2019s the same thing for language learning. Large language models are very good at getting you to practice, but keeping you engaged is pretty hard.\n\nI don\u2019t know if large language models are going to help all that much with that part. In the end, this is a sad thing, but the reality is that Duolingo is very gamified. I wholeheartedly believe most people would rather spend more time playing Candy Crush than talking to others. That\u2019s maybe a sad truth. And there are some exceptions. I mean, people love talking to someone they\u2019re in love with, and sure, that\u2019s nice, but the reality is, most of the time, most people would rather spend time playing Candy Crush or scrolling on Instagram than talking to others. I just don\u2019t think large language models are going to help much with all of that.\n\nYou have a long history in gamification. Your first project, which you sold to Google, was a gamified thing. You did reCAPTCHA, which is essentially gamifying training data in a particular way.\n\nDo you think there\u2019s an evolution in Duolingo \u2014 that the first thing that you worked on was the engagement and bringing users back to the app and having the character, and then the underlying content was language lessons? When I first started using Duolingo several years ago, I was like, \u201cOh, this is very familiar. It\u2019s just that this bird won\u2019t leave me alone and that\u2019s why I\u2019m back again.\u201d And now you\u2019re talking about this whole other spectrum of things: we\u2019re going to use AI; we\u2019re going to have these natural language conversations; we\u2019re going to expand to mathematics.\n\nWhen did you feel like you were making the transition from \u201cwe\u2019re gamifying this very familiar thing\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re using this new engagement mechanism\u201d to \u201cthis is now a wholly new thing\u201d?\n\nFrom the beginning, this is a central thesis that we believe here at Duolingo: the hardest thing about learning something by yourself is staying motivated. In fact, that is probably the reason for the vast majority of our success is that we realized that early on. From the beginning, we have tried to have a thing that is enjoyable to use and that keeps you coming back. We have probably spent more effort on that than anything else.\n\nInternally, our feeling is that learning a language is a lot like working out. It doesn\u2019t matter all that much whether you\u2019re doing the elliptical or a Peloton or a treadmill. By far, what matters the most is that you\u2019re doing it every day, whatever the hell you\u2019re doing. It\u2019s kind of the same with Duolingo. Maybe some methods are more efficient than others, but what matters is that you\u2019re doing it every day. We got very good at that. Now, once we got very good at that, we started trying to add more sophistication in what we teach, and we\u2019ve been doing that for the last few years. But always, primarily, we are a motivation engine.\n\nIs that the core of it still?\n\nIt\u2019s still the core.\n\nI\u2019m going to end up asking you about founder mode, but you\u2019re the founder. How do you keep the focus on that part instead of everything else?\n\nI do. I spend effort on that. But it\u2019s not just me. At the company, it is pretty well understood that if it\u2019s not fun, it\u2019s not going to work. We spend a lot of effort trying to keep Duolingo enjoyable. This is why, for example, when we did this thing where you can talk to an AI to practice conversation, you\u2019re not just talking to a random AI; you\u2019re talking to one of our cast of characters. It has a personality. Really, everything we do, every time we put something out, it\u2019s ingrained in our thinking that, \u201cOh, this has to be enjoyable.\u201d I spend effort pushing that agenda, but I don\u2019t have to all that much because it\u2019s very ingrained in the company.\n\nHow big is Duolingo now?\n\nAbout 850 people.\n\nWhere are you all located?\n\nThe largest office is in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. We have about 400 people there. We have about 250 in New York, and then we have offices in a few cities. We have one in Detroit, we have one in Seattle, one in Berlin, and one in Beijing. All of those offices have 30 people in them. But one key thing is we are not remote. We\u2019ve got to come to one of those offices.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nI just wholeheartedly believe that you can work better that way. Most of what we do, not 100 percent, but most of what we do, is creative stuff. It\u2019s a lot harder to do so over Slack and Zoom. That worked out for about nine months during the pandemic, but it is actually impressive how when the pandemic started and we all had to go remote, we executed pretty well. But toward the end of it, our ideas had run out. We were executing the ideas, but we had run out of new ideas. It\u2019s pretty amazing, as soon as we came back to the office, within three months, you would see all these ideas popping up, and it\u2019s because, when you\u2019re remote, you can\u2019t sit in front of a whiteboard and talk about stuff. Also, we have lunch together here every day. In the lunch line, you hear people being like, \u201cHey, I haven\u2019t seen you in a while. I thought of saying this to you.\u201d It\u2019s just something you would never send a Slack message for.\n\nI think the combination of all of that makes it a better company. I don\u2019t have much proof, but I am extremely convinced.\n\nSundar Pichai at Google told me at the very beginning of the pandemic that he was worried that the company would run out of ideas if they stayed remote too long. He said, \u201cWe know what we need to do for the next turn. I\u2019m worried about what happens at the next turn.\u201d Did you have controversy when you reimplemented return to office?\n\nNo, fortunately not.\n\nDo your employees think that?\n\nNo, no, no.\n\nDo they agree with you?\n\nWe\u2019ve done a lot of dumb things at Duolingo, but this was not one of the dumb things we have done, in retrospect. In my first message saying, \u201cEverybody\u2019s going to work remote,\u201d I said, \u201cBut we\u2019re going to come back to the office. I do not want Duolingo to turn into a remote company. We are not a remote company.\u201d We kept saying that the whole time. A lot of companies did this thing where during the pandemic, they would hire people all over the world because, whatever, you\u2019re remote. We never did that. When we hired people, we would say, \u201cI get that you\u2019re not coming to the office right now, but your job is in New York, and we expect you to be in New York because at some point hopefully soon, we will be back in the office.\u201d We never stopped repeating that. By the time we said, \u201cOkay, time to go back to the office,\u201d this was not a surprise for anybody. I don\u2019t think we lost a single employee from that.\n\nDo you think that the markets you\u2019re in help you with that \u2014 being in Pittsburgh and Detroit? If you were in San Francisco, I think a lot of people would say, \u201cScrew you, I can go get another job.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s probably true. We are not in San Francisco, and that\u2019s probably true. Although the New York office is now the second largest office, and we also didn\u2019t lose people in New York.\n\nDo you find that people are demanding more flexibility even with a full return to office?\n\nSure. I mean, compared to before. For example, we\u2019re not here five days a week in the office. The way we work is Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, you have to be in the office. Monday and Friday, it\u2019s optional. What happens, in practice, is that about half the people come in on Mondays, and around 20 percent of the people come in on Fridays.\n\nWe are talking on a Friday.\n\nI am here. I am here in the office, though.\n\nOh, you\u2019re there. Oh, very good.\n\nI am here in the office. I come. But I don\u2019t feel like I have the political power inside this company to say, \u201cAll right, people, you\u2019ve got to come in five days a week.\u201d I feel like that would not go over well.\n\nOne of the other pieces of the pandemic puzzle and return to office is that there was a suppression of demand to travel and explore. I have friends who, at least from their Instagrams, haven\u2019t set foot back in the United States in two or three years. Have you connected to that group of people who want to learn languages on the go? Has the reexplosion of travel had an impact on your business?\n\nTravel is interesting. Now that we\u2019re a publicly traded company, people have hypothesized all kinds of stuff about travel with us.\n\nThey\u2019re like, \u201cTravel\u2019s opening up. That may be good for Duolingo.\u201d Or they say, \u201cTravel\u2019s drying up. That may be bad for Duolingo.\u201d The reality is that travel does not affect us all that much. I can have hypotheses for why that is, but we have not seen traveling closing down or opening up affect us all that much.\n\nWe have a lot of learners that have different motivations, but the two big buckets are not travel. One of them is a hobby, and that\u2019s the biggest bucket in the US. If you ask people in the US why they\u2019re using Duolingo, the most common answer is, \u201cWell, I used to play a lot of Candy Crush or I used to do a lot of Instagram and now I\u2019m doing Duolingo and at least I\u2019m learning some Spanish. It\u2019s just a hobby.\u201d\n\nAnd then the other huge group is people learning English. For them, it\u2019s not about travel. They just need to learn English either for educational opportunities or for job opportunities. Those two big buckets account for 90\u201395 percent of our users. Travel just doesn\u2019t affect it very much.\n\nWe started talking about latent demand. What are people coming to you for? And then there\u2019s growth, which is, \u201chow do we go create some demand?\u201d When you think about the structure of the company, would you ever say, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go do marketing to make travel happen\u201d? Or is that just not how you think about it?\n\nNo. In our marketing, we haven\u2019t thought about that. Ninety percent of our users come in from word of mouth, and that will keep happening, I think. We also spend very little in marketing comparatively. Our entire marketing budget for the whole world, and we really do operate in every single country in the world, is 50 million a year, which is quite small for a company with our revenue. But whatever we\u2019re doing with marketing seems to be working pretty well, and we don\u2019t spend a lot of money on it.\n\nI feel like I have yet to ask you the Decoder question. So, as long as we\u2019re talking about your marketing spend, how is the company structured?\n\nWe have functions. There\u2019s the marketing function, there\u2019s the engineering function, there is the product management function, design, etc. We have functions and each function has a function head. To give you a relative idea of the sizes of the functions: engineering, product management, and design combined account for about 70 percent of our employees. Design is weirdly large for our company. We have 850 total employees but about 130 people in the design department. So design is large, but we have engineering, product, and design account for about 70 percent.\n\nThose are the people working on the product. If you look at that group, it\u2019s structured into areas, and each area is related to one of the things we\u2019re trying to optimize. For example, with language learning, the three main things we\u2019re trying to optimize are: engagement, so how fun Duolingo is; teaching [the material] better; and how much money we make. We have an area for each one of those things. Then, in each area, there are teams, and in each team, there are people. It\u2019s a little bit of a matrix structure.\n\nOne important thing that I think has worked really well for us \u2014 but it\u2019s not that easy to do \u2014 is that our areas and our teams are not feature-based. What I mean by that is that most software or app companies usually have a team for each feature. So this is the login team, which owns login. Or if you have a leaderboard, this is the leaderboard team and they own the leaderboard. We do not have that. Our teams don\u2019t own features. Our teams own metrics. So we have a team for subscription revenue. We have a team for daily active users. And they can touch whatever they want in the app. All they have to do is continually increase the metrics. There are positives to this, which are very aligned to metrics. There are negatives in that no team owns certain features. When something breaks, there are a lot of people being like, \u201cIt\u2019s not my feature. I don\u2019t know.\u201d There are positives and negatives, but all in all, this has actually worked out really well for us.\n\nThis sounds, one, like a reaction to working at Google where teams do own things like the login screen and they endlessly communicate about how they\u2019re going to change logins. But it also seems like it might work for a small company where one person can see the whole product or understand the whole product and how it all works together. And then you\u2019re going to get inevitable collisions as two people try to change something to increase two different metrics in different directions. How do you resolve those collisions?\n\nThere are definitely collisions. There are a couple of things that help us here. One is, every change to the app passes through this review process called product review, which is not just one person. There\u2019s a group of people that have a lot of knowledge about how the whole thing works. They serve as a little bit of a semaphore, a little bit of like, \u201cNo, you should not do that.\u201d\n\nAnd then the other thing that is really important is we have guardrail metrics. So here\u2019s how that works: If you are on the team that\u2019s trying to improve subscription revenue, your goal is to improve that metric. But we tell you, \u201cYou can\u2019t mess up any of the other metrics.\u201d For example, if you do an experiment that improves subscription revenue by a million bucks or whatever but it decreases daily active users, you can\u2019t launch it. That has really helped teams police themselves. They at least won\u2019t go do anything that really messes something else up. The combination of these two things has helped.\n\nYou are right that if we had 100,000 employees, I don\u2019t think the structure would work. That said, I don\u2019t think that a company like Duolingo, at least with the products that we have, needs 100,000 employees. I think we\u2019ll grow and we\u2019ll continue growing. Maybe we\u2019ll get to, I don\u2019t know, 5,000 employees, but I doubt we\u2019ll ever get to something like 100,000 employees.\n\nHow often do these collisions come all the way up to you? How often do you have to make a tradeoff?\n\nNot that often. Teams police themselves a lot. I do see every single change that passes through the app. I do see that, but usually, I\u2019m not making tradeoff calls. The main thing that I\u2019m looking for is making sure that everything\u2019s high quality.\n\nAt the beginning of the show, you were joking about founder mode because I called you the cofounder. That\u2019s Brian Chesky, who has been on the show. He\u2019s talked a lot about how he refactored Airbnb. He was the conductor of the orchestra. That has gotten whatever amount of attention it\u2019s gotten.\n\nDo you see yourself in that kind of role, that you\u2019re the person who can see the whole app, that you are the person who understands how all these tradeoffs are getting made?\n\nYeah, it\u2019s definitely true. The good news is our employees stick around for a very long time, and our leadership, particularly in the product areas, has been the same for the last eight years. I have a view of everything, but the reality is that our head of product, Cem [Kansu], has a view of everything, too. Our head of design, [Ryan] Sims, also has a view of pretty much everything. Yes, I am in that mode, but we have a number of people who could probably play that role as well.\n\nWhen the three of you disagree, how do you resolve it?\n\nThe good news is there\u2019s little disagreement, which happens for a few reasons. The first is that we\u2019re a very metrics-based company, so usually, we just let the metrics speak. If we run an A/B test and the metrics say something, my opinion doesn\u2019t matter all that much unless it\u2019s something that we think is really like a dark pattern or something. But generally, my opinion or their opinion doesn\u2019t matter all that much. That\u2019s one reason. The other is that we\u2019ve been working together for so long that we\u2019re pretty aligned on everything. And then the last thing, I have the saying, \u201cIf we\u2019re going to go by opinion, let\u2019s go by mine\u201d Generally, when we have disagreements, I see how deeply they believe in their thing, and sometimes I just disagree and commit. But if we believe with equal strength on something, I will just go with my thing.\n\nThat might be the most succinct definition of founder mode I\u2019ve heard yet, actually.\n\nWhat is \u2014 that \u201cif we\u2019re going to go with an opinion, let\u2019s go with mine\u201d?\n\n\u201cJust do what I say\u201d is really the answer to what founder mode is.\n\nBut the majority of things, we don\u2019t really go by opinion. The majority of things are just by data.\n\nSo here\u2019s the other Decoder question. This is a good foundation for it. How do you make decisions? What\u2019s your framework?\n\nFor the company or for me? They\u2019re similar, but they\u2019re not identical.\n\nSome people don\u2019t think they\u2019re different and some people think they are very different, so answer whichever way you want.\n\nFor the company, the decisions are very much tied to return on investment. With most things, there\u2019s a return on investment calculation. Even if we don\u2019t sit there and write the numbers down, there\u2019s how much effort you\u2019re going to put into something and how much you\u2019re going to get back. That drives most of our decision-making. There\u2019s another thing that is not unique to Duolingo but I think is not the norm at most companies, which is, usually, when you\u2019re doing a project, there are three things that matter: how much does it cost?; how fast are you going to do it?; and what\u2019s the quality? Usually there are tradeoffs between these things. At Duolingo, the most important thing is quality, the second most important thing is speed, and the third most important thing is whether we\u2019re on budget. In many companies, it\u2019s the other way around, where the most important thing is budget, then speed, then quality. Here, quality is the most important thing. So that\u2019s another component of our decision-making.\n\nThat\u2019s for the company. For me, it\u2019s very gut feeling-driven, which I used to find myself trying to justify. I have stopped doing that because, at this point, I\u2019m like, \u201cLook, this is what I think we should do. I can tell you reasons that I can probably come up with after the fact, but the reality is that my gut says we should do that.\u201d Because I\u2019ve been working on Duolingo for 13 years, my gut\u2019s pretty good. It\u2019s not 100 percent correct. I make mistakes, but it\u2019s pretty good. I mainly do things based on gut feelings, and then I tell people the justification afterward. But everybody around me knows that these justifications are after the fact. They\u2019re not rational thoughts.\n\nThat obviously works for a startup founder for a private company. You\u2019ve been a public company CEO for over three years. Is that working for you as a public company CEO?\n\nYes, because again, the majority of decisions that we have to make, there\u2019s a clear answer. It\u2019s just like, \u201cWell, look, this is going to lose us money. Let\u2019s not do that.\u201d\n\nBut do you have to change the way you communicate? I\u2019ve heard this from a handful of CEOs who\u2019ve taken their companies public and now they\u2019re on the quarterly reports cadence and they have investors. Elliott Investment Management might show up on your doorstep and be unhappy that you\u2019re not marketing to more Chinese speakers or whatever. Have you had to change that attitude now that you run a public company?\n\nNo, it\u2019s been very fortunate. First of all, we hired an amazing CFO before we went public, Matt Skaruppa, and fortunately, he deals with most public company stuff. I don\u2019t do a lot of that, and I\u2019m very thankful for that because I don\u2019t have a finance background. I have a PhD in computer science. That\u2019s what I\u2019m good at, not finance. So there\u2019s that.\n\nThe other thing we\u2019ve been fortunate about so far as a public company is that we\u2019ve executed well. I think that has given us a little bit of latitude in that basically we don\u2019t get asked very tough questions because we\u2019ve executed very well. I am sure that won\u2019t be the case forever. I\u2019m sure at some point we\u2019re going to miss a quarter. We haven\u2019t so far, but I\u2019m sure we will. And when that happens, I\u2019ll probably have to answer some questions and I\u2019ll probably have to tell people, \u201cSorry, we\u2019ll be more buttoned up from now on.\u201d But so far, I show up to earnings calls in a T-shirt. The day you see me show up to an earnings call in a suit, you\u2019ll know that we fucked up.\n\nYeah, it\u2019s time to get out.\n\n[Laughs] Like, \u201cOh, so sorry.\u201d\n\nThe other thing I hear from public company CEOs is something that relates to your emphasis on quality first. You have a lot of metrics, which means your investors can see a lot of your metrics or demand a lot of your metrics in different ways. Quality is not measurable in that way, right?\n\nIt\u2019s not.\n\nAt least in the current market, it\u2019s not a great story to investors if you\u2019re saying, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re going to invest a bunch of money in AI, and we think in this use case, it\u2019s going to be really successful for us or we can charge more for it but we have to spend a bunch of money upfront and we have to wait to make it good.\u201d How are you managing that now?\n\nYou\u2019re right, quality is not measurable. The way we make decisions about that is that, particularly in our design department, we have people who are very much sticklers about quality. We\u2019re like, \u201cNope, that\u2019s just not good enough.\u201d We do that a lot.\n\nIn terms of investment, I mean, honestly, with the public markets, we don\u2019t talk much about that. We talk about the metrics. We don\u2019t talk too much about how it turns out we spent an extra month working on this feature just because we didn\u2019t really like the way the owl was animated. We don\u2019t talk too much about that. I think that\u2019s fine. But my guess is that if we went on earnings calls and spent all of our time talking about how much effort we put into animating our owl, I don\u2019t think people would like that.\n\nI honestly think more companies should spend more time talking about how much time they spend making things good. That would be, I think, a significant upgrade to American capitalism.\n\nI would like that. But yeah, the reality is we do spend an inordinate amount of time on things. If you look at our app, it, over time, has become very animated. We spend an inordinate amount of time looking at the precise frames of the animation. We\u2019re like, \u201cSee, this is not smooth enough.\u201d I\u2019m not claiming that our app is perfect, but we at least try really hard for it to get as close to perfect as possible.\n\nOne thing that also seems hard to measure, or a metric that might lead you in different directions, is how successful Duolingo is. Maybe the most important metric of all is: Are people getting good at Spanish? Are they leaving this experience with the ability to communicate in Spanish? Do they not just know the language but can actually communicate? Can you measure that?\n\nYes, we can, but not as effectively as you would like to measure it. So the answer is, yes, Duolingo works. We have measurements. I\u2019ll tell you how we measure it. Unfortunately, this is the only way we know how to measure it reliably. It\u2019s not that great of a way, but it\u2019s this: You take somebody who\u2019s just starting Duolingo, you ask them a bunch of questions about their previous knowledge, and you also give them a test to measure how much they know. Then you have them use Duolingo for a long time because it takes a while for you to actually learn stuff in the language. You have them use it for a year or two. And then, at the end of that period, you ask them questions about whether they used other resources and you also give them a test to figure out how much better they got. It turns out that people who knew nothing before and used Duolingo and did not use other resources learn about as much as or more than in a classroom. It varies by the study, but we\u2019re pretty happy with that. The results actually work.\n\nThe problem with this way of measuring is that it\u2019s very slow. It takes one or two years for us to get a new measurement, and I really don\u2019t like that. But we have not been able to come up with a better way despite the fact that we have tried. We\u2019ve done things in the app where we\u2019re like, \u201cOkay, we can do micro-measurements of whether you\u2019ve learned this word.\u201d It\u2019s been super complicated to do that and never given great results. So we just rely on these old-school, \u201cpre-test, post-test\u201d methods. That\u2019s it.\n\nThis is where you veer right into lengthy society-level debates about education and how we measure the performance of schools and teachers. Do you feel like you\u2019re participating in that system? You\u2019re using their measurements, right? This is how schools do it. They test you.\n\nWe are using their measurements, and efficacy is really important. We spend a lot of effort trying to make sure that we\u2019re efficacious. The other good news, even though the timescale here is in years, is that you can plot how effective Duolingo is. If you look at it over the last 10 years, every year it is more effective than the previous year, for sure.\n\nThat\u2019s on this test-based measure. More people are passing the test?\n\nYes, more people are getting higher scores on the test. Basically, people are learning more on Duolingo every year. And there are a number of reasons for that because we work to try to teach [the content] better. But it is definitely true.\n\nAt this point, when we compare ourselves, we know we are as good as or better than a classroom environment. We know we\u2019re not yet as good as a good one-on-one human tutor. Our goal is that we can do that over the next three to five years: be as good as a one-on-one human tutor in terms of efficacy. But we\u2019re way better in terms of getting you to stick around. But in terms of efficacy, if you have the money and the strength to continue going, a one-on-one human tutor does better.\n\nDo you think that there\u2019s a conflict between gamification and engagement \u2014 the things that you\u2019re historically successful at \u2014 and education?\n\nYes, there is.\n\nHow do you manage that conflict?\n\nVery easily. Always go with engagement.\n\nReally?\n\nYes.\n\nI mean, presumably, you\u2019ve heard both sides of the argument. Why have you made this decision?\n\nI\u2019ll give you many arguments, but the one that works the most is this: It doesn\u2019t matter how effective you are. You can\u2019t teach somebody who\u2019s not there.\n\nAnd that\u2019s it?\n\nThat\u2019s it. People leave. The reality is it\u2019s not always true that engagement and learning outcomes are at odds. But when they are, we usually prefer going for engagement. I\u2019ll give you an example. There are some things that are frustrating, and frustration makes you leave. We actually just smooth them. By that I mean, if I could force you to sit there, I may be able to teach the material to you in five minutes, but it\u2019d be a very frustrating five minutes. Instead, what we do is teach it to you in two hours \u2014 just way slower, but the whole time, things are animating on the screen and you\u2019re getting dopamine hits or whatever. Even though a really good teacher could have taught it to you in five minutes, watching you make mistakes, it would have been frustrating. We much prefer to keep you around.\n\nPart of the reason is because we\u2019re in an app setting as opposed to a school setting. In a school setting, the truth is the kids are held hostage there. They can\u2019t leave. With an app setting, the tiniest frustration, people are like, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m going to go to TikTok now.\u201d We just can\u2019t lose those users. So we always opt for engagement, but that doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t teach the material to you. We\u2019ll just take it a little slower.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that you have thought about this a lot.\n\nWe\u2019ve spent years thinking about this.\n\nI want to round this out a little bit because you have a very clear answer and a very clear point of view. What do you think the specific tension between gamification and education is? What are you losing when you always pick gamification?\n\nProbably the thing you\u2019re losing is efficiency \u2014 by that I mean, the amount of content learned per unit time. The truth of the matter is, I grew up in the third world a while ago. Some of the stuff that I grew up being taught, my teachers were hitting me while teaching it. I\u2019m not kidding. They would hit me. The reality is that I probably learned really fast because when you were learning penmanship, if you did the wrong thing, they hit you with a ruler. You have a real incentive to get that done very fast. You just learn really fast because you\u2019re like, \u201cWhoa.\u201d So I think it\u2019s true: you can learn faster if you\u2019re in an environment where you\u2019re forced to do so and nobody cares whether you feel good about it. But in our case, I\u2019m okay with slightly slower learning as long as you\u2019re still engaged.\n\nEfficiency, I understand that one. I had some pretty strict teachers in my time, but I was really good at taking the tests. My wife and I went to college together. She\u2019s much smarter than me.\n\nBut you\u2019re a good test taker.\n\nShe was always mad at me because I could just show up at the end and take the test. This is truly probably why she didn\u2019t date me for years, because of that core frustration. This is what I mean by education. That human teacher can evaluate whether you\u2019re good at taking a test or whether you\u2019ve actually learned something. That\u2019s the tradeoff that I was getting at, is that if it\u2019s all a gamification engagement, people might just learn to play the game. They might not have learned anything.\n\nThere\u2019s probably a little bit of that. It\u2019s very hard to measure, of course. But the reality is, ultimately, it works. Duolingo works. Just as an example, for me, I\u2019ve been using only Duolingo to learn French for the past few years. At this point, I can watch Netflix shows in French \u2014 with no subtitles or anything. I just watch them, and it works. So you\u2019re right, there\u2019s probably a tradeoff. It\u2019s probably pretty hard to measure. But what we\u2019re looking for here is that people are actually using their time well.\n\nI want to try to tie all of these themes and ideas together. You have a big vision for Duolingo. You\u2019ve talked about it a lot. Being available to teach everybody languages around the world, being in a number of countries. And then there\u2019s the fact that you\u2019re a public company. You\u2019ve got to make money. You\u2019re still showing up in T-shirts. The first thing that comes immediately to my mind is, you\u2019re launching new things like math and music, and they\u2019re not available on Android, which is the single most popular operating system in the world. It\u2019s used by the majority of lower-income people in the world. That feels like an immediate tension, that the best experience of Duolingo is on the platform that wealthier people use. How do you resolve that?\n\nIt\u2019s a good point. First of all, math and music are about to be available on Android, or by the time this airs, they will be available on Android. We are about a year behind on Android. This has been true on Duolingo almost since the beginning. Android has been six months to a year behind iOS. There are a number of reasons for that, but probably the biggest one is that it has been harder to find really good Android developers when compared to iOS developers. There are just more really good iOS developers, so we have more of them at Duolingo.\n\nThe way we work is that we experiment with most new features on iOS. Because a new feature is usually not that great off the bat, you usually have to do trial and error to try to make it better. By the time it\u2019s good, we port it to Android. That\u2019s how we operate.\n\nWe understand the importance of Android. You are right. There are more people with Android phones than iPhones. Generally, all features are going to make it to Android, just about six months behind, and we feel okay about that. It\u2019s also easier to develop on iOS for a number of reasons, not just that there are more developers. So that\u2019s it, we\u2019re just ahead.\n\nIn retrospect, given the technology that there is today, maybe we would be doing something that is cross-platform where we develop on all platforms at the same time, but we\u2019re locked into being native on both ends. We have a native app for iPhones and we have a native app for Android phones. That was the best thing we could do 10 years ago, and we\u2019re locked into that.\n\nWhen you think about growing the company, supporting multiple platforms, that\u2019s just double the effort all the time. Is it on your mind that, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re going to intentionally slow down development here so we can keep this team smaller\u201d?\n\nIt is, and we don\u2019t have one huge project where we\u2019re going to stop all development and be like, \u201cYou know what? We\u2019re going to now be in a single platform kind of thing.\u201d But we are slowly getting there. I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019ll take. The hard part with this is that if we were to start from scratch right now, the decision would be clear, but you also have to keep the plane going. It\u2019s such a big investment to do this that we will probably have to stop all development for a year and a half or something. I don\u2019t even know the timeline because it\u2019s just so big. So far, we have decided to do this piecemeal rather than all at once.\n\nYour premium subscription tier, the Max tier, only just arrived on Android.\n\nLiterally in the last few days.\n\nOne thing I\u2019ve heard over and over again since the dawn of the modern smartphone is that iOS users spend more money.\n\nYes, four times as much. At least for Duolingo, a given user spends four times as much per capita.\n\nSo the majority of your money is coming from iOS users, is what I\u2019m getting from this.\n\nYes. More of our money comes from iOS than from Android. Even though we have more Android users than iOS users. It\u2019s just hard to overcome that 4x.\n\nIs that demographically that they have 4x the income? Or is it that demographically, iOS users are spending four times the money in your app?\n\nNo, it\u2019s 4x the income. It\u2019s that a user spends four times as much. We have more Android users, but it doesn\u2019t balance out in the end. We make more money from iPhone. I\u2019m going to give you a number here just to give you an idea. The split of users is 60 / 40, so 60 percent Android, 40 percent iOS. The split of revenue is the other way around. It\u2019s basically 60 percent iOS, 40 percent Android. Those are very rough estimates.\n\nSo when you think about expansion, again, a public company, if most of your users are on Android and Android is the biggest operating system in the world but all of your money is on iOS, how do you resolve that tension?\n\nIs it that we\u2019re going to make our money on iOS and not Android? The big mission is to bring free language education to all of those other people, so is the iOS user subsidizing the free mission?\n\nI mean, that\u2019s one way of thinking about it. It\u2019s not quite true that all our money is on iOS. It\u2019s just that more money is on iOS, that\u2019s for sure. But it is a little bit true, regardless of Android versus iOS, if you just look at who pays for Duolingo at the moment, they are usually people who are well off. They may not be millionaires, but they are people who live in countries like the US that are wealthy, countries that have salaries like $100,000 a year. A person with a good, stable job in a wealthy country, that is who pays for Duolingo. The people who use Duolingo for free are usually in poor countries. They may not have a stable job, so it is true that we\u2019re getting the wealthy people to subsidize the education for everybody. That is the case, and that\u2019ll probably always be the case.\n\nNow, on our end, we also need to get better as a business to get more people in some of these developing countries to pay. As a good example, Netflix has done a really good job of getting people in Brazil and India to pay. We have not done as good of a job, and part of the issue is that we\u2019re freemium. Again, I grew up in a poor country. Even if the price is scaled down to match the GDP per capita and it\u2019s much cheaper, the problem that you have in a poor country is that the attitude is, \u201cI won\u2019t pay unless I have to.\u201d That\u2019s just the attitude. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s just a dollar, and I do happen to have a dollar. I just won\u2019t pay unless I have to.\n\nWhat you see is extreme tolerance for ads. For example, we can put 10 ads at the end of a lesson and they still won\u2019t pay. This is why, for example, Netflix does so well in some of these countries because, with Netflix, there\u2019s no free. They\u2019re just like, \u201cLook, whatever, you have to pay.\u201d And people are like, \u201cFine, fine. I\u2019ll pay.\u201d So we have to figure out what to do as a freemium product in these countries, and we have some ideas, but the reality is, we have not really succeeded at strong monetization in countries like India.\n\nDo you think that that is the next logical place for you to grow as you think about English education?\n\nFor sure, we are spending a lot of effort on that. And it is growing, which is nice, but it\u2019s a massive opportunity. Language learning is another funny thing where the largest market is a country like the US: rich countries. Language learning as a whole, not Duolingo, but language learning as a whole, the largest market is actually developing countries: the Indias, Vietnams, Brazils, and Mexicos of the world. They\u2019re learning English, and that\u2019s the largest language-learning market, but we have not cracked it. We have cracked the smaller one, which is the US and Western Europe and richer countries. We\u2019ve cracked that in terms of monetization and in terms of users. We have a lot of users in India; they just don\u2019t pay us.\n\nI feel like I have to ask you about the owl. It\u2019s very important to everyone that I ask you about the owl. At least as expressed in this country, the owl is a very online, very culturally defined character. If you took the owl outside of United States social networks and dropped it anywhere else, it wouldn\u2019t make any sense. Is the owl expressed culturally in different markets, or is it just one owl?\n\nI don\u2019t know how to answer the question. It\u2019s in between. We started using social media with the owl a while ago. It grew mostly in the US through TikTok because the owl does unhinged stuff on TikTok.\n\nWait, hold on. The owl doesn\u2019t do anything. How big is the team that writes and performs the owl?\n\nFive people.\n\nOkay. And they work at Duolingo?\n\nYes.\n\nI\u2019m assuming they\u2019re in New York City?\n\nActually, no. Most of them are in Pittsburgh.\n\nOkay. I didn\u2019t realize Pittsburgh had this many terminally online people. Godspeed.\n\nYes. But it started out with TikTok and it was mainly in the US. That was several years ago. What has changed in that time is, first of all, we are no longer just relying on TikTok. It is now on YouTube, YouTube Shorts, Instagram, etc. So it\u2019s everywhere on social media. That\u2019s one big thing. The other one is that we learned how to localize this to different markets. So we started Duolingo accounts for a bunch of countries: Mexico \u2014 well, Spanish speaking \u2014 Japan, Brazil, Germany, France, China, etc. We have figured out how to make all of them succeed. I was dubious at first when somebody told me we were going to open an account in Germany. No offense to Germans, but I thought, \u201cThese people don\u2019t have a sense of humor.\u201d\n\nOh my gosh.\n\nBut it turned out\u2014\n\nThey do.\n\nThey do! In fact, it\u2019s one of our more successful accounts. [The international accounts] are a little different. It\u2019s not that different, but they are a little different.\n\nAnd these are the same five people locally?\n\nNo, we have a global team, which is these five people, and in each country, we have a small number of people, probably one or two people, that localize this stuff. And \u201clocalize\u201d doesn\u2019t mean we take the exact same videos and in Mexico put a sombrero on. That\u2019s not that. We have themes and we have figured out what themes work globally and also what themes work in certain countries. For example, the German one, we had a really big thing on Oktoberfest. Also, at some point, because there\u2019s this dance club scene in Berlin, I guess they all went to one of those 24-hour dance clubs. Each country does different stuff, and it\u2019s worked out pretty well.\n\nWhat\u2019s the hiring process like to be the writer for the Duolingo owl? Do you just read people\u2019s Twitter accounts and say, \u201cYou\u2019re unhinged enough to do this\u201d?\n\nIt\u2019s a lot of that by now because we are such a presence online. By the way, I didn\u2019t know this until recently but there are weeks when our video on TikTok is the most watched video on all of TikTok that week. That happens. By now, our accounts are so well known that we have our pick in terms of [recruitment], and a lot of people want to work for that team. Typically, we just look at what they\u2019ve done before. It\u2019s a small group of really good creators, so we hire from that group. Usually, these are pretty funny people that are even funnier online, but when they\u2019re offline, they\u2019re not as funny. They\u2019re still funny, but when they\u2019re offline, you\u2019re like, \u201cIt\u2019s you? It\u2019s you who came up with that?\u201d\n\nAnd you measure everything, it sounds like. Is this working? Are you getting lots of new users because of the owl?\n\nYes, this works. By the way, this is not paid. All that social marketing is not paid. It\u2019s free. We make our videos and they go viral. About 15 percent of our users are coming in from social media. Now, if you look at social media views of our content, which we measure in the billions, there\u2019s a roughly equal number of social media views of our content versus the content that is about us but not made by us. Also, there are a lot of other people just making content about Duolingo, but they\u2019re not us, and they combined have about as many views as we do.\n\nHave you ever told the team to pump the brakes? Have you ever looked at something they\u2019ve made and said, \u201cWe just can\u2019t do this\u201d?\n\nYeah. There\u2019s our review. There\u2019s an approval process. We\u2019re close to the line in some of the stuff that we have put out, and we have in fact gone across the line and published things that we shouldn\u2019t have. Since we did that, we now have a pretty strict approval process. This is a whole layer, and the last step is basically me. But stuff doesn\u2019t come to me often because there are people before me, like the CMO, so there are a lot of steps.\n\nWhat\u2019s the last one the CMO was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Luis has to approve this one\u201d?\n\nI\u2019m trying to remember what that one was.\n\nWhat\u2019s the last one they convinced you to do even though you were skeptical?\n\nI don\u2019t remember the exact video, what it was, but I know that the last one that I approved, I was wrong, as in, I shouldn\u2019t have approved it. A lot of this you only know in retrospect. You don\u2019t know until it happens because you put it out and then you see this reaction. I don\u2019t remember what it was, but I know I approved it and I know I was wrong because I didn\u2019t imagine that it was going to have that reaction. We haven\u2019t had that many faux pas. It\u2019s been like three or four videos that were like, \u201cYou probably shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d\n\nThe other thing happened about a year ago. We had made this crazy video. It was insane. We were a little hesitant about it, and we ended up cutting it. There are all these memes online about how the owl really wants you to learn a language, and it goes to great lengths, including kidnapping your family. This was a video about kidnapping, and we were a little hesitant about it, and then the October 7th attack happened, and we cut it. And then we cut it last year, and we thought, \u201cWell, you know what? We may use it next year.\u201d This year came along and again we cut it. And then we came up with an internal thing that a year when we can play that, it\u2019s probably been a good year for humanity.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah. We\u2019re probably never going to play that.\n\nThe world context of that one needs to be substantially improved, I think. All right, I have to end with a feature request. You\u2019ve given us a lot of time, and then I\u2019ll let you get out of here. We talked a lot about India. We talked a lot about emerging languages. Can you put Gujar\u0101t\u012b in this app?\n\nOh, man.\n\nThis is the language that I can understand and speak like a baby, but I can\u2019t read or write it, and I would love to close the loop.\n\nYou\u2019re asking for languages. That\u2019s a hard one.\n\nIt\u2019s a huge language.\n\nI know, I know.\n\nIt\u2019s the native language of Gandhi, of the current prime minister of India.\n\nThere is this unfortunate thing about being a huge language versus the desire to learn it. It\u2019s a pretty big difference. Hindi is probably the one that has the most desire to learn it in terms of Indian languages. It\u2019s a tiny number of people who are learning it. It\u2019s got to be, I don\u2019t know exactly off the top of my head, but it\u2019s certainly well below 1 percent of our learners are learning Hindi. I\u2019m going to guess 0.1 percent of our learners are learning Hindi. That\u2019s the hard part about adding languages, that we have to maintain them, we have to do a really good job with them, and then, in the end, we just don\u2019t get a lot of usage. So, sorry.\n\nAll right. That\u2019s a hard no. It\u2019s one of the first times a CEO has given me a hard no. That\u2019s again, founder mode.\n\nWell, it\u2019s just really hard to say yes to. In the past, I used to say yes to this stuff, and we made a lot of mistakes adding languages that, in retrospect, we probably shouldn\u2019t have added.\n\nHave you ever cut languages?\n\nWe have. We cut, what was it? I think it was Afrikaans. But the cut in part was because there was very little demand. The biggest reason was it was just a low-quality course, and at some point, we thought this was a bigger brand risk than anything else. We made the decision, we\u2019re like, \u201cWell, could we improve it or what?\u201d And we made the decision it was not worth improving.\n\nDo you think AI is going to help you add languages?\n\nMaybe, but unfortunately, at the moment, AI is really good for big languages and really bad for smaller languages. There\u2019s a pretty high correlation with the languages we offer. AI is very good at the languages we have: the Spanish and the French. It\u2019s not super good at your Esperanto or Navajo or smaller languages.\n\nAI is notoriously bad at math, or at least the current LLMs are pretty bad at math. Are they going to help you with that?\n\nThe good news is that, in the constrained environment that we have, it can help quite a bit. It\u2019s been helping quite a bit. A lot of the data that we generate for our math course is with AI. The other thing is, some of it is without AI, but it turns out, just computers are good at math.\n\nIt\u2019s funny how many times I\u2019ve asked this question and someone fails to bring up the idea that there\u2019s a computer. I\u2019m happy you did that.\n\nComputers are good at math! And I understand AI is not so good at following a pattern or whatever. It may not be so good at that. But the data that we generate for our math course is a lot of stuff like fractions and multiplication. Computers are pretty good at generating that data.\n\nAll right. Well, Luis, you\u2019ve given us a lot of time. Thank you so much for being on Decoder.\n\nThank you for having me. And great questions.",

        "text": "WordPress.org has taken over a popular WP Engine plugin in order \u201cto remove commercial upsells and fix a security problem,\u201d WordPress cofounder and Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg announced today. This \u201cminimal\u201d update, which he labels a fork of the Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin, is now called \u201cSecure Custom Fields.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what security problem Mullenweg is referring to in the post. He writes that he\u2019s \u201cinvoking point 18 of the plugin directory guidelines,\u201d in which the WordPress team reserves several rights, including removing a plugin, or changing it \u201cwithout developer consent.\u201d Mullenweg explains that the move has to do with WP Engine\u2019s recently-filed lawsuit against him and Automattic.\n\nSimilar situations have happened before, but not at this scale. This is a rare and unusual situation brought on by WP Engine\u2019s legal attacks, we do not anticipate this happening for other plugins.\n\nWP Engine\u2019s ACF team claimed on X that WordPress has never \u201cunilaterally and forcibly\u201d taken a plugin \u201cfrom its creator without consent.\u201d It later wrote that those who aren\u2019t WP Engine, Flywheel, or ACF Pro customers will need to go to the ACF site and follow steps it published earlier to \u201cperform a 1-time download of the genuine 6.3.8 version\u201d to keep getting updates.\n\nAs its name implies, the ACF plugin allows website creators to use custom fields when existing generic ones won\u2019t do \u2014 something ACF\u2019s overview of the plugin says is already a native, but \u201cnot very user friendly,\u201d feature of WordPress.\n\nThe Verge has reached out to Automattic, WordPress.org, and WP Engine for comment.",

        "text": "In September of 2023, Danny and Steven Sanicki played a round of minigolf. The Sanickis are twins, are both competitive golfers, and were budding content creators at the time, so of course they filmed the whole round. Danny edited the footage on his phone, recorded a quick commentary track, slapped a scoreboard over top of the video, and posted the tournament as a six-part series on his TikTok channel. Neither brother really expected anything to happen.\n\nThe videos went viral. And since then, the Sanicki twins have been posting tournaments every day, bringing new friends into the fold, and building out a Putt-Putt empire all around the web. They built a complex system of tournaments and points, started awarding money to winners, and began planning for how to make things even bigger.\n\nOn this episode of The Vergecast, the first in a two-part series we\u2019re calling How to Make It in the Future, we chart the rise of Twin Tour Golf (as they\u2019d prefer to be known) and talk with Danny and Steven about their experience as creators. We talk about the process of deciding to go all in on minigolf, the way they\u2019ve tried to expand their offering without compromising what people like about it, how they split up workflow, how they monetize on various channels, and much more. The Sanickis\u2019 story is a classic creator journey, and they\u2019ve hit so many of the milestones and forks in the road that come for everyone who wants to make it on the internet.",

        "title": "Adobe\u2019s AI video model is here, and it\u2019s already inside Premiere Pro",
        "text": "Adobe is making the jump into generative AI video. The company\u2019s Firefly Video Model, which has been teased since earlier this year, is launching today across a handful of new tools, including some right inside Premiere Pro that will allow creatives to extend footage and generate video from still images and text prompts.\n\nThe first tool \u2014 Generative Extend \u2014 is launching in beta for Premiere Pro. It can be used to extend the end or beginning of footage that\u2019s slightly too short, or make adjustments mid-shot, such as to correct shifting eye-lines or unexpected movement.\n\nClips can only be extended by two seconds, so Generative Extend is only really suitable for small tweaks, but that could replace the need to retake footage to correct tiny issues. Extended clips can be generated at either 720p or 1080p at 24 FPS. It can also be used on audio to help smooth out edits, albeit with limitations. It\u2019ll extend sound effects and ambient \u201croom tone\u201d by up to ten seconds, for example, but not spoken dialog or music.\n\nThe new Generative Extend tool in Premiere Pro can fill gaps in footage that would ordinarily require a full reshoot, such as adding a few extra steps to this person walking next to a car. Image:Adobe\n\nTwo other video generation tools are launching on the web. Adobe\u2019s Text-to-Video and Image-to-Video tools, first announced in September, are now rolling out as a limited public beta in the Firefly web app.\n\nText-to-Video functions similarly to other video generators like Runway and OpenAI\u2019s Sora \u2014 users just need to plug in a text description for what they want to generate. It can emulate a variety of styles like regular \u201creal\u201d film, 3D animation, and stop motion, and the generated clips can be further refined using a selection of \u201ccamera controls\u201d that simulate things like camera angles, motion, and shooting distance.\n\nThis is what some of the camera control options look like to adjust the generated output. Image: Adobe\n\nImage-to-Video goes a step further by letting users add a reference image alongside a text prompt to provide more control over the results. Adobe suggests this could be used to make b-roll from images and photographs, or help visualize reshoots by uploading a still from an existing video. The before and after example below shows this isn\u2019t really capable of replacing reshoots directly, however, as several errors like wobbling cables and shifting backgrounds are visible in the results.\n\nHere\u2019s the original clip... Video: Adobe\n\n...and this is what it looks like Image-to-Video \u2018remakes\u2019 the footage. Notice how the yellow cable is wobbling for no reason? Video: Adobe\n\nYou won\u2019t be making entire movies with this tech any time soon, either. The maximum length of Text-to-Video and Image-to-Video clips is currently five seconds, and the quality tops out at 720p and 24 frames per second. By comparison, OpenAI says that Sora can generate videos up to a minute long \u201cwhile maintaining visual quality and adherence to the user\u2019s prompt\u201d \u2014 but that\u2019s not available to the public yet despite being announced months before Adobe\u2019s tools.\n\nThe model is restricted to producing clips that are around four seconds long, like this example of an AI-generated baby dragon scrambling around in magma. Video: Adobe\n\nText-to-Video, Image-to-Video, and Generative Extend all take about 90 seconds to generate, but Adobe says it\u2019s working on a \u201cturbo mode\u201d to cut that down. And restricted as it may be, Adobe says its tools powered by its AI video model are \u201ccommercially safe\u201d because they\u2019re trained on content that the creative software giant was permitted to use. Given models from other providers like Runway are being scrutinized for allegedly being trained on thousands of scraped YouTube videos \u2014 or in Meta\u2019s case, maybe even your personal videos \u2014 commercial viability could be a deal cincher for some users.\n\nOne other benefit is that videos created or edited using Adobe\u2019s Firefly video model can be embedded with Content Credentials to help disclose AI usage and ownership rights when published online. It\u2019s not clear when these tools will be out of beta, but at least they\u2019re publicly available \u2014 which is more than we can say for OpenAI\u2019s Sora, Meta\u2019s Movie Gen, and Google\u2019s Veo generators.",

        "title": "Violent threats against FEMA swirl on social media",
        "text": "FEMA employees scrambling to respond to the devastation caused by hurricanes Milton and Helene are facing a new, unexpected challenge: violent threats on social media.\n\nTikTok posts either calling for violence or applauding unverified claims about physical attacks against FEMA personnel have garnered millions of views, according to a report yesterday from nonprofit Media Matters for America. X has also been fertile ground for threats of violence against FEMA, says another analysis published yesterday by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD).\n\n\u201cThis content is reaching millions of people and, in some instances, poses a credible risk to public safety,\u201d ISD says.\n\nSocial media misinformation has fed distrust in FEMA, which officials warn could hamper efforts to help people in the wake of Helene and Milton. \u201cIf it creates so much fear that my staff doesn\u2019t want to go out in the field, then we\u2019re not going to be in a position where we can help people,\u201d FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell said in a Tuesday call with reporters, as reported by Axios. \u201cI worry that they won\u2019t apply for assistance, which means I can\u2019t get them the necessary items they need to support them.\u201d\n\n\u201cPunishment can mean being unalived immediately\u201d\n\nOne post on TikTok from a person with around 5,700 followers garnered 204,000 views, according to Media Matters. It\u2019s a video with text that says, \u201cDear Feds and Fema \u2026 if you violate your constitutional oath to protect and assist, the charge will be TREASON. Punishment can mean being unalived immediately by the citizens you are withholding aid from.\u201d\n\nFEMA has had to combat false claims that it is confiscating donations to hurricane survivors, turning away volunteers, or diverting funds to support migrants, among other misleading rumors about disaster aid that have blown up online recently. The agency set up a webpage for \u201churricane rumor response\u201d last week.\n\nThat post and others mentioned in the Media Matters report appeared to have been taken down when The Verge searched for them today. However, users who created those videos have posted other content that\u2019s still up with similar, thinly veiled threats or misinformation about FEMA\u2019s role in hurricane response.\n\nAnother video by the same user says, \u201cFema, Feds and anyone withholding aid from those in need ... The US military is aware of what you\u2019re doing and the crimes you\u2019re committing.\u201d It\u2019s set to a song whose lyrics declare \u201clet the bodies hit the floor.\u201d That video was still up this morning and had garnered more than 1,000 views.\n\nAnother video from the same account says, \u201cFEMA is not your friend ... If a fed tries to exercise their nonexistent authority, do what you need to do to survive.\u201d The audio accompanying the text is ringing bells, which sound like a \u201cdeath knell.\u201d That video, posted two days ago, had garnered more than 1,500 views.\n\n\u201cWe immediately removed all content in the report and are proactively working to keep misinformation off TikTok and connect people to reliable information from FEMA,\u201d TikTok spokesperson Ariane de Selliers said in an email to The Verge.\n\nThe Verge also found links to that user\u2019s deleted video on Elon Musk\u2019s X. Musk himself has spread disinformation about FEMA, including a post last week that says the agency was \u201cactively blocking citizens who try to help.\u201d FEMA\u2019s acting director for response and recovery, Keith Turi, refuted the claim on ABC on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, ISD analyzed 33 posts on X promoting false claims about hurricane response, which garnered 160 million views by October 7th. False information about the hurricane response has \u201cspawned credible threats and incitement to violence directed at the federal government \u2014 this includes calls to send militias to face down FEMA for the perceived denial of aid, or to shoot and/or harm FEMA officials and the agency\u2019s emergency responders,\u201d the report says.\n\nNearly a third of the posts analyzed also contained antisemitic hate, according to the ISD. Much of the content targets Jaclyn Rothenberg, director for public affairs at FEMA. Posts questioning her \u201cloyalty to the country based on her Jewish heritage\u201d received millions of views. And the same accounts spreading misinformation about Helene were also tied to content disparaging migrants and denying climate change, ISD says.\n\nWhen asked how it\u2019s handling misinformation and threats against FEMA on its platform, X pointed to its Community Notes program, a crowd-sourced fact-checking feature. It says posts on X that are tagged with user-submitted notes \u201care (organically!) reshared less.\u201d X also posted on October 9th that \u201cCommunity Notes related to recent weather events are showing on hundreds of posts and have already been seen well over 44 million times. Views have increased over 30% in just the past 24 hours.\u201d\n\nFEMA\u2019s been the subject of right-wing conspiracy theories for years, an issue that\u2019s cropping up again with elections around the corner. \u201cJust because of the level of outreach and misinformation we\u2019re going to have to counter, we have additional staff, and we\u2019re plussing up those efforts,\u201d FEMA\u2019s Criswell said in a press briefing yesterday. \u201cI do believe that the volume of the misinformation is starting to go down, but we need to continue to now, remain focused on what our mission is and that our mission is here to help people.\u201d",

When you tap the shutter button on your phone, and it grabs nearly a dozen frames out of a cache that was capturing data well before you pressed anything, then stitches together the \u201cbest\u201d bits of each one before allowing you to edit everything about all of them, is any of that process you taking a photo? And in a world where AI is good enough to make everything look good, does it even matter? When you ask the question enough times, it becomes the size of the universe \u2014 and we\u2019ve definitely asked the question enough times to get there.\n\nOn this episode of The Vergecast, we dig into the question again from two different angles. First, we chat with Ben Sandofsky and Sebastiaan De With, the cocreators of the popular camera app Halide. We talk about their perception of the iPhone\u2019s camera, how people\u2019s use of cameras has changed over the years, and why Halide\u2019s new Process Zero mode, which removes all the iPhone\u2019s processing in favor of just capturing one frame at a time with no changes, has been such a hit with users.\n\nAfter that, The Verge\u2019s Allison Johnson joins the show to tell us about an experiment she\u2019s been running on herself. After reviewing this year\u2019s slate of AI phones with AI cameras, she decided to go all in on AI and let Google, Apple, and Samsung do all the work of taking and editing photos for her. We talk about how that approach changed the photos she captured, the way she captured them, and the way she feels about them now.\n\nFinally, The Verge\u2019s Victoria Song helps us answer a question from the Vergecast Hotline (866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com) about whether a pair of Pixel Buds or a set of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are the better option for audio on a run.

        "title": "How the DOJ wants to break up Google\u2019s search monopoly",
        "text": "After winning a fight to get Google\u2019s search business declared an unlawful monopoly, the Department of Justice has released its initial proposal for how it\u2019s thinking about limiting Google\u2019s dominance \u2014 including breaking up the company.\n\nThe government is asking Judge Amit Mehta for four different types of remedies to Google\u2019s anticompetitive power in search engines. They include behavioral remedies, or changes to business practices, as well as structural remedies, which would break up Google. And they\u2019re focused particularly on futureproofing the search industry for the rise of generative AI. While AI might not be a substitute for search engines, the DOJ warns, it \u201cwill likely become an important feature of the evolving search industry.\u201d And it aims to prevent Google from using its power in the industry to regain unfair control.\n\nThe DOJ also has a particular focus on futureproofing the solutions\n\nThe government sees four areas where it can constrain Google\u2019s power. In these, it\u2019s asking Judge Mehta to limit the kinds of contracts Google can negotiate, require rules for nondiscrimination and interoperability, and change the structure of its business. \u201cFully remedying these harms requires not only ending Google\u2019s control of distribution today, but also ensuring Google cannot control the distribution of tomorrow,\u201d the government says. Google, for its part, calls the government\u2019s proposals \u201cradical\u201d and believes they\u2019re \u201csignaling requests that go far beyond the specific legal issues in this case.\u201d\n\nWhat does that mean for Google\u2019s competitors and the average user? Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nSearch distribution and revenue sharing\n\nGoogle\u2019s search engine comes preloaded on many phones and is the default on most major web browsers, often because of revenue sharing deals that pay for that placement. The DOJ argued in court that consumers are highly unlikely to switch to a competitor, and Google\u2019s commercial partners also have little incentive to do so while they\u2019re getting paid. So, the DOJ says \u201cundoing\u201d Google\u2019s impact on distribution is the \u201cstarting point for addressing Google\u2019s unlawful conduct.\u201d\n\nThe government says it\u2019s considering restrictions on the contracts Google can strike with phone makers and browser companies, particularly agreements to make Google Search a default or have it preinstalled.\n\nGoogle doesn\u2019t just strike deals with other companies, though \u2014 it promotes its search engine and AI business with an array of other Google products, including Chrome, Android, and the Play Store. The DOJ argues this limits the available channels and incentives for rivals to compete. It didn\u2019t offer too many details about how to fix this but said it\u2019s considering both behavioral and structural remedies \u2014 in other words, a breakup.\n\nAnd finally, a group of states that filed a related lawsuit want to address a final problem: users not realizing they\u2019ve got other options. They\u2019re considering ways Google could support education campaigns that inform people about competing search engines.\n\nAccumulation and use of data\n\nAt trial, the government argued that Google creates a self-reinforcing cycle of dominance through users\u2019 query data. Essentially, the more queries a search engine gets, the more information it has about what constitutes a useful answer, and the better the search engine becomes. Because Google\u2019s rivals don\u2019t have the same access to distribution channels that Google does, the DOJ argued, Google is able to siphon away most of these queries, making it much more difficult for rivals to improve their products and effectively compete.\n\nThe government says it wants to try to \u201coffset\u201d that advantage, potentially by forcing Google to make certain information and aspects of its product available to rivals. That could include things like data, indexes, and models used in \u201cAI-assisted search features\u201d and ranking signals Google uses in search.\n\n\u201c... genuine privacy concerns must be distinguished from pretextual arguments to maintain market position or deny scale to rivals\u201d\n\nThe DOJ says it\u2019s \u201cmindful of potential user privacy concerns\u201d that making Google share data would raise. \u201cHowever, genuine privacy concerns must be distinguished from pretextual arguments to maintain market position or deny scale to rivals.\u201d Privacy tradeoffs are a common defense from big tech firms against opening up their ecosystems, but the government is making clear that it doesn\u2019t think they\u2019re a be-all and end-all. It\u2019s considering prohibiting Google from using data that \u201ccannot be effectively shared with others on the basis of privacy concerns.\u201d\n\nGeneration and display of search results\n\nThe government is also concerned with \u201cnew and developing features of general search,\u201d particularly generative AI. In this field, it argues much of Google\u2019s power stems from scraping data from sites with \u201clittle-to-no bargaining power against Google\u2019s monopoly.\u201d These sites may not want their work used to train AI models, but they \u201ccannot risk retaliation or exclusion from Google\u201d by blocking its crawlers altogether. As a result, the DOJ is considering requiring that Google let sites opt in to search engine inclusion while opting out of inclusion in its AI tools.\n\nAdvertising scale and monetization\n\nIn addition to the general search market, Mehta found that Google has monopoly power in the market for general search text ads: the sponsored text links that appear when you enter a query. (This is different from the market at issue in Google\u2019s second legal battle with the DOJ, which dealt with the tools used to serve ads on publishers\u2019 sites across the internet.) Mehta found that Google does not consider rivals\u2019 prices in figuring out its own for this product \u2014 something he says only a monopolist with no meaningful competition could do.",

        "title": "Fujifilm goes after aspiring vloggers with its new $800 X-M5 camera",
        "text": "Even as it keeps working to catch up with demand for the massively popular X100VI, Fujifilm has been on a steady cadence of releasing new cameras. The X-T50 was announced in May, and it was the first to feature a physical dial for switching between the company\u2019s signature film simulations. That dial is carrying forward to the new, budget-tier X-M5 that Fujifilm is announcing today.\n\nThe X-M5 is priced at $799.95 and is an affordable gateway into the company\u2019s interchangeable lens mirrorless camera lineup.. Fujifilm is positioning it as a lightweight camera ideal for everyday shooting and \u201cemerging content creators\u201d who want to vlog with it \u2014 despite a lack of in-body image stabilization (IBIS). At 13 ounces (355 grams), the X-M5 is the lightest body in Fujifilm\u2019s current X-Series family. It comes in silver or black, but the black version won\u2019t be shipping until April. The silver will be in stores next month.\n\nThe X-M5 is the second camera to have a dedicated dial for Fujifilm\u2019s film simulations. Image: Fujifilm\n\nFujifilm is pushing the message that for as good as our smartphone cameras might be, the X-M5 has a far larger sensor that\u2019s capable of capturing more. At the top left of the camera is the film simulation dial, which offers quick access to eight film simulations and three custom slots where you can assign another favorite from the 20 built-in options. The X-M5 also has a PASM-style mode dial, a fully articulating rear LCD (though there\u2019s no EVF), and the microphone input is in a unique spot on the back of the camera near the hotshoe.\n\nBut even if you don\u2019t have an external mic, the X-M5 is Fujifilm\u2019s first camera to include a three-mic system. \u201cYou can choose from four microphone directivity options: surround, front, back, or front and back, depending on the situation,\u201d the company\u2019s press release says. To help with clearer audio, the camera is also capable of cutting out steady-state noises like air conditioning or other constant hums.\n\nThe X-M5 has a fully articulating rear display. Image: Fujifilm\n\nThe X-M5 includes Fujifilm\u2019s tried and true 26.1-megapixel CMOS sensor and the company\u2019s current-generation X-Processor 5. Fujifilm can\u2019t seem to escape criticism of its system\u2019s continuous autofocus performance, and so the company is rolling out a newly-enhanced predictive autofocus algorithm that it believes should rectify the inconsistent hit rate that some customers have experienced with its recent cameras.\n\nFor video, the camera can capture 6.2K/30P 4:2:2 10-bit video, and in this era of vertical social media content, it\u2019s also got a 9:16 \u201cShort Movie Mode\u201d that caps out at full HD resolution.\n\nThere are several tradeoffs that Fujifilm had to make to hit the X-M5\u2019s price. The rear LCD has an unremarkable resolution of 1.04 million dots. (By comparison, the X-S20 has a 1.84-million dot LCD.) The camera also uses Fujifilm\u2019s older and smaller-capacity battery, so if you\u2019re out for a long day of vlogging, it\u2019ll be wise to carry a spare. And the SD card slot is still UHS-I. That shouldn\u2019t be a huge issue for the target market here, but it\u2019s worth mentioning.\n\nThe new 16-55 f/2.8 II, seen here on an X-T5, is significantly smaller and lighter than the original. Image: Fujifilm\n\nIn addition to its latest body, Fujifilm is also announcing the second version of its very impressive XF16-55 f/2.8 lens. The new glass is significantly smaller and lighter than the original, which has grown to be perhaps my favorite lens in Fujifilm\u2019s arsenal. But it can definitely get heavy at times \u2014 especially on my X-H2 \u2014 so I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what a difference the downsizing has made. Fujfilm says the new model is even sharper and better at resolving the 40-megapixel sensor found in the X-T5, X-H2, and X-T50. It costs the same $1,199.95 as before and will be available in December.\n\nYou\u2019d never catch me using a lens this expensive in a situation like what\u2019s depicted here. That rock looks slippery! But much respect to this man. Image: Fujifilm",

        "title": "The Optimus robots at Tesla\u2019s Cybercab event were humans in disguise",
        "text": "Tesla made sure its Optimus robots were a big part of its extravagant, in-person Cybercab reveal last week. The robots mingled with the crowd, served drinks to and played games with guests, and danced inside a gazebo. Seemingly most surprisingly, they could even talk. But it was mostly just a show.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious when you watch the videos from the event, of course. If Optimus really was a fully autonomous machine that could immediately react to verbal and visual cues while talking, one-on-one, to human beings in a dimly lit crowd, that would be mind-blowing.\n\nAttendee Robert Scoble posted that he\u2019d learned humans were \u201cremote assisting\u201d the robots, later clarifying that an engineer had told him the robots used AI to walk, spotted Electrek. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote that the robots \u201crelied on tele-ops (human intervention)\u201d in a note, the outlet reports.\n\nThere are obvious tells to back those claims up, like the fact that the robots all have different voices or that their responses were immediate, with gesticulation to match.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t feel like Tesla was going out of its way to make anyone think the Optimus machines were acting on their own. In another video that Jalopnik pointed to, an Optimus\u2019 voice jokingly told Scoble that \u201cit might be some\u201d when he asked it how much it was controlled by AI.\n\nAnother robot \u2014 or the human voicing it \u2014 told an attendee in a stilted impression of a synthetic voice, \u201cToday, I am assisted by a human,\u201d adding that it\u2019s not fully autonomous. (The voice stumbled on the word \u201cautonomous.\u201d)",

        "title": "How SpaceX became the MyPillow of government contractors",
        "text": "It really has been something to watch Elon Musk turn SpaceX into the MyPillow of rocket companies, hasn\u2019t it?\n\nMusk has figured out he can leverage the culture wars to his advantage\n\nI have never accused Musk of being anything other than self-interested. As I see it, his only real politics are: Elon Musk should get to do whatever he wants, forever. And his latest political outbursts strike me as being clearly connected to his money. He\u2019s come to the same conclusion as Donald Trump, which is that it\u2019s particularly easy to grift Republican voters, and there are lots of rewards and very few consequences for doing so. Donny, these men are nihilists.\n\nOn the face of it, it might look stupid for a businessman to alienate one of the major US political parties. Musk has a long history of taking subsidies from local, state, and federal governments. His business SpaceX is built essentially on agency contracts in the heavily regulated aerospace industry. But I\u2019m guessing Musk has figured out he can leverage the culture wars to his advantage.\n\nThose of you familiar with SpaceX may recall its litany of lawsuits against the government. For instance, in 2005, the company alleged that Boeing and Lockheed Martin had engaged in anticompetitive behavior meant to keep SpaceX from letting its Falcon 9 compete in government contracts. (The Falcon 9 didn\u2019t have its first launch until 2010.)\n\nAnd in 2014, Musk sued the US Air Force over a $11 billion sole-source contract awarded to the United Launch Alliance. (The Falcon Heavy wouldn\u2019t have its first launch until 2018.) SpaceX got concessions, dropping the suit after the Air Force agreed to speed up its efforts to certify SpaceX to launch military satellites \u2014 and making more launches available for SpaceX to compete on.\n\nThese suits got Musk what he wanted\n\nNow I personally, as a woman familiar with the linear concept of time, find these suits odd. How could SpaceX compete using a rocket it hadn\u2019t yet launched? Sure, the \u201cindefinite delivery / indeterminate quantity\u201d contracts existed for the Falcon I, but that wasn\u2019t what SpaceX was suing over. And yet, these suits got Musk what he wanted: more possible government contracts. In fact, such suits have been as much a hallmark of SpaceX as its rockets.\n\nIf you are the kind of person who uses lawsuits to get what you want, you may have made note of the fact that Donald Trump appointed 200 federal judges, including \u201cnearly as many powerful federal appeals court judges in four years as Barack Obama appointed in eight,\u201d as Pew Research puts it. In 2021, more than a quarter of active federal judges were Trump appointees. Let\u2019s not pretend that\u2019s insignificant; if it were, the Federalist Society wouldn\u2019t exist. If Musk supports Republicans, they\u2019ll keep appointing judges who believe things that favor Musk \u2014 and he might even get lucky and get some blatantly partisan judges, who\u2019d support him because of his affiliation.\n\nConsider Texas, which has taken a real interest in Musk\u2019s affairs. During Musk\u2019s Twitter acquisition, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced an investigation of Twitter bot numbers \u2014 an investigation that neatly aligned with the argument Musk was making to try to get out of buying the social media company. Of course, there\u2019s also the Texas judge who owned Tesla stock and greenlit a Musk-backed lawsuit against Media Matters for America. (The judge in question is known for his politically conservative rulings.)\n\nBut wait! There\u2019s more. In 2020, SpaceX was awarded almost $900 million in rural broadband subsidies from the FCC under Trump. But in 2022, the Biden-era FCC rescinded that funding since \u201cthe applicant had failed to meet its burden.\u201d Two Republican FCC commissioners objected, and now a Republican House Oversight Committee chair is probing the FCC\u2019s decision.\n\nDoes this sound cynical? I suppose\n\nCulture war issues are meant to motivate a largely apathetic voter base that doesn\u2019t especially give a shit about government appropriations. They have been used historically by Republicans, starting with Barry Goldwater, in order to enact specific financial policies that have largely hurt lower-class Americans. It seems Musk has paid enough attention to this particular historical quirk to decide the culture war can help him, too.\n\nDoes this sound cynical? I suppose. Sincere, coherent political beliefs are largely the province of the bourgeoisie and nerds who paid attention in government class. The Elon Musks of the world are interested in power. Not everything Musk says is necessarily calculated or politically beneficial \u2014 his partisan allegiances have also extended to having friendly conversations with mask-off white nationalists and reposting theories that women are incapable of thought. Crucially, however, there are no negative consequences for these actions \u2014 only more attention, which seems to be his personal heroin.\n\nConsider the rocket situation. For NASA, Musk is the only game in town besides Boeing, and he knows it. He also knows that even if he publicly misbehaves \u2014 smokes weed, for instance \u2014 NASA will do nothing punitive. And I do blame the brain geniuses at NASA. Instead of having in-house rockets for launching our spy satellites, we\u2019re now dependent on Boeing (lol, lmao), the United Launch Alliance (a joint venture that includes\u2026 Boeing), and SpaceX. (Sure, Jeff Bezos\u2019 also-ran Blue Origin exists, I guess, but come on.) By outsourcing its engineering, NASA put the national security apparatus at the whims of contractors gone wild.\n\nAnd Musk\u2019s gamble appears to be that being a visible Republican will benefit him more than being neutral, presumably because he assumes, probably correctly, that Democrats won\u2019t punish him for this. So when it comes to, let\u2019s say, SpaceX\u2019s environmental damage, the safety record of Tesla\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving,\u201d and working conditions for his employees, aligning with Republicans lets him suggest any examination of his behavior is politically motivated. Convenient, isn\u2019t it?\n\nYou can see the ambition even with the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. By courting the right, as he has unquestionably done, he has attempted to create a value proposition for a company he has largely destroyed. The skew also gives him an excuse: if X dies, Musk can claim it wasn\u2019t because it was mismanaged but destroyed by the radical left or whatever. Thanks to his friendly judges, he can even take those \u201cradical left\u201d critics to the cleaners in court!",

The Tesla Robovan (Musk pronounces it ruh-BO-vehn) looked like something out of an Art Deco fever dream, with a sleek train engine-like shape and no visible wheels. Musk said that the vehicle could carry up to 20 people or be used to transport goods.\n\n\u201cThe Robovan is what\u2019s gonna solve for high density,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you want to take a sports team somewhere, or you\u2019re looking to really get the cost of travel down to, I don\u2019t know, 5-10, cents a mile, then you can use the robovan.\u201d\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 14 Previous Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 14\n\nThe Robovan is intended for the company\u2019s Tesla Network, an autonomous ridehailing service for purpose-built self-driving cars, as well as Tesla customers\u2019 personally owned vehicles.\n\nTesla has dropped hints about a van before. In its Master Plan Part Deux, the company said it was developing \u201chigh passenger-density urban transport\u201d and also suggested that autonomous buses could be deployed. And earlier this year, Musk showed an image of a cloaked van-shaped vehicle as part of the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting.\n\nGiven Musk\u2019s notorious disdain for public transportation, it seemed unlikely that he would commit resources to anything like a van.

The night\u2019s surprise, however, was a brand-new \u201cRobovan\u201d transport vehicle that can be configured as \u201cmass transit\u201d or a cargo carrier.\n\nFor years, Musk has been promising that a driverless Tesla vehicle was just \u201ctwo years away.\u201d Many delays later, Musk has shown fans and investors something. Their reaction to the \u201cWe, Robot\u201d event will be a referendum on whether Musk can deliver real self-driving technology that can compete with robotaxi companies like Waymo and Cruise.",

        "text": "Both T-Mobile and AT&T have plans to release their first devices soon that run on RedCap, a 5G specification that is tooled for Internet of Things devices, according to Fierce Wireless.\n\nWhat is RedCap? Great question! Also called \u201creduced capability\u201d or NR-Light, RedCap is a low-bandwidth version of 5G that\u2019s expected to make certain devices, like wearables, sensors, or surveillance cameras simpler and more power efficient, according to an Oracle document. That could mean cheaper cellular-connected smartwatches, XR glasses, or other portable products that don\u2019t need high-powered antennas and fast throughput last longer on a charge.\n\nAT&T, which began testing the spec on its own network early this year, reportedly plans to release its first NR-Light devices in 2025, Fierce Wireless writes. T-Mobile will launch one of its own before this year is out.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what those devices will be, but AT&T AVP of device architecture Jason Silkes has hinted at what early NR-Light products could look like, telling Fierce in June that the first RedCap devices will probably be cheap mobile hotspots and dongles. Indeed, TCL announced a 5G USB dongle last week, catchily named the TCL Linkport IK511.",

Evidence is key: firsthand experience or revealing documents will be more useful than a hunch. Have you encountered something that the public should know about? If so, we want to hear from you.\n\nNote: this is only for editorial tips. For advertising, technical support, and other inquiries, go here .\n\nHow to tip The Verge\n\nEmail\n\nEmail is the easiest way to reach us.
