But Suleyman sidestepped.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t buy the metaphor that there is a finish line. This is another false frame,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to stop framing everything as a ferocious race.\u201d\n\nHe then proceeded to toe the Microsoft corporate line about his company\u2019s arrangement with OpenAI, in which it invested a reported $10 billion through some combination of cash and cloud credits. The deal gives Microsoft a big stake in OpenAI\u2019s for-profit business, and allows it to embed its AI models into Microsoft wares and sell its tech to Microsoft cloud customers. Some reports indicate that Microsoft may also be entitled to some OpenAI payments.\n\n\u201cIt is true that we have ferocious competition with them,\u201d Suleyman said about OpenAI. \u201cThey are an independent company. We don\u2019t own or control them. We don\u2019t even have any board members. So they do entirely their own thing. But we have a deep partnership. I\u2019m very good friends with Sam, have huge respect and, trust and faith in what they\u2019ve done. And that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to roll for many, many years to come,\u201d Suleyman said.\n\nThis close/distant relationship is important for Suleyman to profess. Microsoft\u2019s investors and enterprise customers appreciate the close relationship. But regulators did get curious and in April, the EU agreed that its investment was not a true takeover. Should that change, in all likelihood so would the regulatory involvement.\n\nSuleyman says he trusts Altman on AI safety\n\nIn a sense, Suleyman was the Sam Altman of AI before OpenAI. He has spent most of his career in competition with OpenAI, and is known for his own ego.\n\nSuleyman was the founder of AI pioneer DeepMind and sold it to Google in 2014. He was reportedly put on administrative leave following allegations of bullying employees, as Bloomberg reported in 2019, then moved to other Google roles before leaving the company in 2022 to join Greylock Partners as a venture partner. A few months later, he and Greylock\u2019s Reid Hoffman, a Microsoft board member, launched Inflection AI to build its own LLM chatbot, among other goals.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella tried but failed to hire Sam Altman last fall, when OpenAI fired him and then quickly reinstated him. After that, Microsoft hired Suleyman and much of Inflection in March, leaving a shell of a company and a big check. In his new role at Microsoft, Suleyman has been auditing OpenAI code, Semafor reported earlier this month. As one of OpenAI\u2019s previous big rivals, he\u2019s now getting to dive deep inside the crown-jewel frenemy competitor.\n\nThere\u2019s yet another wrinkle to all of this. OpenAI was founded with a premise of doing AI safety research, to stop a one-day evil AI from destroying humankind. In 2023, when he was still an OpenAI competitor, Suleyman released a book called \u201cThe Coming Wave: Technology, Power and the 21st Century\u2019s Greatest Dilemma\u201d with researcher Michael Bhaskar. The book discusses the dangers of AI and how to prevent them.\n\nA group of former OpenAI employees signed a letter earlier this month outlining their fears that OpenAI and other AI companies are not taking safety seriously enough.\n\nWhen asked about that, Suleyman also proclaimed his love and trust for Altman, but also that he wants to see both regulation and a slower pace.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m a Brit with European tendencies, but I don\u2019t fear regulation in the way that sort of everyone seems to by default,\u201d he said, describing all of this fingerpointing by the former employees as a \u201chealthy dialogue.\u201d He added, \u201cI think it\u2019s a great thing that technologists and entrepreneurs and CEOs of companies like myself and Sam, who I love dearly and think is awesome\u201d are talking about regulation. \u201cHe is not cynical, he is sincere. He believes it genuinely.\u201d\n\nBut he also said, \u201cFriction is going to be our friend here. These technologies are becoming so powerful, they will be so intimate, they\u2019ll be so ever-present, that this is a moment where it\u2019s fine to take stock.\u201d If all of this dialog slows down AI development by six to 18 months or longer \u201cit\u2019s time well spent.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all very cozy between these players.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman Image Credits: TechCrunch\n\nSuleyman wants cooperation with China, AI in classrooms\n\nSuleyman also made some interesting comments on other issues. On the AI race with China:\n\n\u201cWith all due respect to my good friends in DC and the military industrial complex, if it\u2019s the default frame that it can only be a new Cold War, then that is exactly what it will be because it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. They will fear that we fear that we\u2019re going to be adversarial so they have to be adversarial and this is only going to escalate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to find ways to cooperate, be respectful of them, whilst also acknowledging that we have a different set of values.\u201d\n\nThen again, he also said that China is \u201cbuilding their own technology ecosystem, and they\u2019re spreading that around the world. We should really pay close attention.\u201d\n\nWhen asked his opinion on kids using AI for schoolwork, Suleyman, who said he doesn\u2019t have kids, shrugged it off. \u201cI think we have to be slightly careful about fearing the downside of every tool, you know, just as when calculators came in, there was a kind of this gut reaction, oh, no, everyone\u2019s gonna be able to sort of solve all the equations instantly. And it\u2019s gonna make us dumber because we weren\u2019t able to do mental arithmetic.\u201d\n\nHe also envisions a time, very soon, where AI is like a teacher\u2019s aide, perhaps chatting live in the classroom, as AI\u2019s verbal skills improve. \u201cWhat would it look like for a great teacher or educator to have a profound conversation with an AI that is live and in front of their audience?\u201d\n\nThe upshot takeaway is that, if we want the people who are building and profiting from AI to govern and protect humanity from its worst effects, we may be setting unrealistic expectations.", "authors": "['Julie Bort']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Microsoft-AI-CEO-Mustafa-Suleyman.png?resize=1200,624", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/microsofts-mustafa-suleyman-says-he-loves-sam-altman-believes-hes-sincere-about-ai-safety/", "timestamp": "1719365793.604751", "displayed": 0}

We should really pay close attention.\u201d\n\nWhen asked his opinion on kids using AI for schoolwork, Suleyman, who said he doesn\u2019t have kids, shrugged it off. \u201cI think we have to be slightly careful about fearing the downside of every tool, you know, just as when calculators came in, there was a kind of this gut reaction, oh, no, everyone\u2019s gonna be able to sort of solve all the equations instantly. And it\u2019s gonna make us dumber because we weren\u2019t able to do mental arithmetic.\u201d\n\nHe also envisions a time, very soon, where AI is like a teacher\u2019s aide, perhaps chatting live in the classroom, as AI\u2019s verbal skills improve. \u201cWhat would it look like for a great teacher or educator to have a profound conversation with an AI that is live and in front of their audience?\u201d\n\nThe upshot takeaway is that, if we want the people who are building and profiting from AI to govern and protect humanity from its worst effects, we may be setting unrealistic expectations.", "authors": "['Julie Bort']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Microsoft-AI-CEO-Mustafa-Suleyman.png?resize=1200,624", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/microsofts-mustafa-suleyman-says-he-loves-sam-altman-believes-hes-sincere-about-ai-safety/", "timestamp": "1719365826.853558", "displayed": 0}

But giving them actual, living skin that can be manipulated into horrifying, slimy expressions? That\u2019s new.\n\nThe new work, published in the journal Cell Reports Physical Science, is very much just an experiment. This will not be the face of your next smart home hub or vacuum.\n\nBut it may well be that the ingenious machinery produced by billions of years of evolution may be better in some situations than artificial skin (also very much in development) or simpler surfaces. This brings up several questions \u2014 many, in fact, but only one is really the topic of the paper, as is proper in scientific inquiry.\n\nTo wit: How would such a living tissue surface, whatever its advantages and disadvantages, attach to the mechanical foundation of a robot\u2019s limb or \u201cface\u201d?\n\nIn humans and other animals, there is a network of ligaments that anchors the skin to underlying muscle and tissue. This works pretty well, I\u2019ve found. And the researchers at the University of Tokyo and Harvard wanted to test whether they could create a version of this that let living skin both cling closely to an artificial substrate, and also be manipulated in various directions without tearing or unintended distortion.\n\nHow did their \u201cdermis equivalent\u201d turn out? I\u2019ll let you be the judge:\n\nImage Credits: University of Tokyo\n\nAh, nightmare fuel. But you can\u2019t accuse it of being anything less than well-moisturized.\n\nOf course it\u2019s horrifying now, but it\u2019s not intended to be realistic or beautiful \u2014 just to illustrate a potential method for attachment of living tissue to robotic undercarriage.\n\nYes, that is in fact exactly what a Terminator T-100 model has, but let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. Skin-covered robots could do all kinds of useful stuff in addition to infiltrating the past to destroy humanity\u2019s future.\n\nCultured skin, as they put it, can heal itself, carry biological sensors like our own to provide sensitive touch, and could also have benefits in medical or human interaction contexts.\n\nBut only if it can stay alive on there and also be moved around in the same ways our own skin is during everyday use.

{"title": "Fearless Fund\u2019s founder has resigned, and it\u2019s a sad reflection on the VC world for Black women", "text": "On Monday, Fearless Fund\u2019s co-founder Ayana Parsons announced that she was stepping down from her leadership role from the firm. She will no longer be its general partner and COO but will be off \u201cenjoying island life\u201d with her family, she said in a LinkedIn post. She co-founded the fund in 2019 with partner Arian Simone, who remains its CEO.\n\nFearless Fund was founded with a mission to provide venture capital financing, grants and financial education to startups founded by Black women. That\u2019s a demographic that is both particularly underserved and promising. Less than 1% of all VC dollars in 2023 went to Black-founded startups, which amounts to around $661 million out of $136 billion, according to Crunchbase data.\n\nSo Fearless Fund is doing exactly what venture capitalists are supposed to do: find an overlooked area (in Silicon Valley they might call it taking a \u201ccontrarian view\u201d) and invest. The fund has so far invested $26 million into over 40 companies that include Slutty Vegan, The Lip Bar, Partake Foods, and Live Tinted, Atlanta Daily World reports.\n\nThe money invested and granted is from private limited partners. The LPs who supported the fund want to support this thesis. The companies receiving money are still private startups. Since so little classic VC funding is going to these businesses, the community is building their own rails. Everyone in this ecosystem is OK with this.\n\nStill, it is being sued by a politically conservative group called the American Alliance for Equal Rights (AAER) over its charitable grants program. AAER is challenging the fund\u2019s right to provide $20,000 in small business grants to Black women, claiming the program violates the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which bans the use of race in contracts.\n\nAAER was founded by Edward Blum, an activist who helped successfully overturn affirmative action in universities and is now conducting several other lawsuits in similar veins (e.g., the AAER is currently suing the Smithsonian Institute\u2019s Latino Museum Studies Program for hiring Latino interns).\n\nThe case is not going particularly well for Fearless Fund. As TechCrunch recently reported, earlier this month an appeals court ruled against Fearless. It upheld a preliminary injunction that prevents the firm from making grants to Black women business owners. The firm told TechCrunch at that time it is weighing its options on how to proceed.\n\nLast year, when the case made national news, numerous founders and investors told TechCrunch about the infuriating irony of using the Civil Rights Act of 1866 to protest the firm\u2019s program, as it was initially put into place to help the formerly enslaved and is now being used against the community it sought to help.\n\nIn the months that followed, the frustration of this case within the community has not lessened. Earlier on Monday, Parsons had an emotional moment onstage at the ForbesBLK Summit in Atlanta. She was joined by political leader Stacey Abrams and the chief diversity officer of Congress, Dr. Sesha Joi Moon.\n\n\u201cAnytime you are surrounded by Black women, they are going to pour into you,\u2019\u2019 Parsons said, according to Forbes. \u201cSo, when I walked on this stage, these eyes were watering because they understood the heavy burden that is on all of us in this country.\u2019\u2019\n\nAfter announcing her resignation, Parsons told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and her spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the lawsuit against Fearless was not a motivating factor. But she did not otherwise explain her decision to leave. She also remains an investor in the fund. \u201cAs co-founder, Ayana is still an investor and she has always had multiple ventures centered around inclusion leadership and development, venture capital, and entrepreneurship. Fearless Fund is merely one avenue in her pursuit to be an advocate for the marginalized,\u201d her spokesperson said.\n\nParsons said in her LinkedIn post that she founded the firm \u201cto help change the game for women of color entrepreneurs. And my rationale was simple: women of color are the most founded yet the least funded. They are starting businesses at a faster rate than any other demographic yet lack access to the capital, resources, education and networks needed to scale their businesses.\u201d\n\nShe also promised not to give up on her goal. \u201cI remain steadfast in my support of and commitment to the advancement of women of color,\u201d she said in an emailed statement, mentioning that she\u2019ll soon be publishing a book, too.\n\nStill, as we previously pointed out, the sad fact is that big names in the tech ecosystem have not exactly come out swinging in support. CEO Simone told Inc. earlier this year that the fund had lost nearly all its partnerships aside from two, JPMorgan and Costco. Even Mastercard, who sponsored the now-contested Strivers Grant, has publicly never commented on the lawsuit.\n\nIndeed, support for anything considered DEI has done a complete pendulum swing in tech in 2024, from its height in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd. Currently, it has become more in vogue to publicly pan DEI and praise the so-called meritocracy.\n\nThis story was updated to include statements from Parsons and her public relations representative.", "authors": "['Julie Bort', 'Dominic-Madori Davis']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Kk3VUxfA-e1687456679564.jpg?resize=1200,717", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/fearless-fund-founder-resigned-vc-venture-capital-startups-black-women/", "timestamp": "1719365834.3992808", "displayed": 0}

OpenAI\u2019s popular AI chatbot is available to all macOS users, the company announced on Tuesday. The app was first announced ahead of Apple\u2019s WWDC 2024 in June, where the companies jointly announced integrations between OpenAI\u2019s chatbot and Apple\u2019s operating systems for iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\nOn the latter platform, users can quickly call up ChatGPT by using the keyboard combination of Option + Space after installing the new ChatGPT app.\n\nThe ChatGPT desktop app for macOS is now available for all users.\n\n\n\nGet faster access to ChatGPT to chat about email, screenshots, and anything on your screen with the Option + Space shortcut: https://t.co/2rEx3PmMqg pic.twitter.com/x9sT8AnjDm \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) June 25, 2024\n\nThis makes access to the AI chatbot something that will immediately feel familiar to macOS users who regularly use other keyboard shortcuts like Command + Space to pop up a search bar to access Spotlight Search. But instead of more traditional search, they\u2019ll have access to a wider world of knowledge, only one button away. Once launched, ChatGPT appears as a chat interface overlaid on top of the screen.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s launch of the macOS app was a bit overshadowed at the time of the original announcement, as it arrived alongside GPT-4o, its flagship generative AI model that promises more advanced intelligence, including the ability to handle not only text and speech but also video. (Its multimodal capabilities and ability to understand media give the AI model its name; the \u201co\u201d stands for \u201comni.\u201d)\n\nChatGPT\u2019s desktop app was announced in the same press release, as a new app for both free and paid users. The company noted at the time that it could be called up with the simple keyboard shortcut and users could also take and discuss screenshots directly in the app. Users can upload files and other photos via the macOS app, too, as well as speak to ChatGPT from their desktop and search through their past conversations.\n\nThe app had been slowly rolling out to Mac users, starting with Plus subscribers, but today the company announced in a post on X that it\u2019s now available to everyone.\n\nThis isn\u2019t OpenAI\u2019s only integration with Apple devices. At WWDC, the companies announced a more expansive deal that will also see Apple customers gaining access to ChatGPT from their iPhones and iPads, including through Siri and within other areas that could be aided by AI, like Writing Tools.

{"title": "10 of the most exciting digital health startups of 2024, according to VCs", "text": "In the post-COVID world, VCs say it\u2019s not as easy to get excited about investing in digital health. Deal activity in healthcare IT was relatively flat in Q1 2024 at 74 total deals, valued at about $1 billion total, up only 3% from the year-ago quarter, according to PitchBook data.\n\nStill, promising startups have grabbed investors\u2019 attention this year. TechCrunch spoke with about a dozen healthcare VCs about the companies they think have the most promising future. While recently formed AI-driven startups that are solving staggering administrative challenges in the U.S. healthcare system dominated their recommendations, they also mentioned several slightly older, non-AI-focused businesses.\n\nWe narrowed their suggestions to the list of names that more than one VC mentioned, which came in at an even 10 companies. VCs discussed with us the companies that were both in their portfolios and not.\n\nAbridge\n\nWhat it does: Uses AI to automate medical records based on conversations between doctors and patients.\n\nFounded in 2018 by Shiv Rao, a practicing cardiologist, Abridge is an early entrant into the medical note-taking space and one that has secured integration with the all-powerful Epic Systems health records software.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: The Pittsburgh-based startup generates excitement among investors and hospital systems eager to free up physicians\u2019 time spent on note-taking. Abridge is the health tech startup that among investors we talked to was mentioned the most.\n\nSome investors said that Abridge is leading its category. Other companies competing to dominate the AI-powered medical note-taking market include Ambience, Nabla, Microsoft-owned Nuance and Suki.\n\nFunding: In February, Abridge raised a $150 million Series C led by Lightspeed Ventures at a valuation of $850 million, a mere four months after the virtual medical scribe startup grabbed a $30 million Series B from Spark Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners, CVS Health Ventures and others.\n\nCodaMetrix\n\nWhat it does: Founded in 2019, CodaMetrix uses AI to automate medical coding. The company\u2019s technology translates medical notes stored in electronic health records into diagnostic codes, helping to reduce errors and administrative burdens.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Medical coding is tedious and error-prone. Entering an incorrect code for a condition or treatment can lead to insurance rejection of claims and other administrative problems. Moreover, the burden of entering codes falls on already busy physicians and nurses, leading to increased stress and burnout.\n\nThe company has competitors, including Fathom Health, but investors say that CodaMetrix has one of the largest annotated coding datasets.\n\nFunding and valuation: In March, CodaMetrix grabbed a $40 million Series B from Transformation Capital with participation of returning investors SignalFire and Cressey Ventures. The deal valued the Boston-based company at $220 million, according to PitchBook.\n\nCohere Health\n\nWhat it does: Cohere Health expedites health insurance approval process, known as prior authorization, for medical conditions with the help of AI.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Prior authorization management could take medical and administrative staff hours as it requires gathering appropriate documentation for submission to health insurers or Medicaid. Cohere Health\u2019s AI can reduce the time it takes to do this to minutes, saving medical and administrative staff hours on these tasks.\n\nInvestors say that Cohere is for now the leader in the space, but other startups that expedite health insurance approval for medical conditions include Anterior and Alaffia Health.\n\nFunding: Cohere Health raised a $50 million Series B earlier this year from Deerfield Management with participation from Define Ventures, Polaris Partners, Longitude Capital and Flare Capital Partners.\n\nGrow Therapy\n\nWhat it does: Grow Therapy connects therapists who want to start independent practices with patients and insurers. Founded in 2020, the startup employs the so-called business-in-box model because it gives mental health professionals tools for filing claims, receiving payments and being matched with patients.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: The company claims that its business model offers therapists more flexibility than if they were to provide their services through marketplaces like Headway or Lyra. While it\u2019s not clear whether that\u2019s indeed the case, Grow, true to its name, is growing fast, investors say.\n\nFunding and valaution: In April, Grow closed an $88 million Series C led by Sequoia at a $1.4 billion valuation, according to PitchBook data.\n\nEquip\n\nWhat it does: Four-year-old Equip provides online treatment for kids, teens and adults in all 50 states and accepts most health insurances. Equip providers are also trained to address co-occurring conditions like anxiety, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: About 10% of the U.S. population develops an eating disorder during their lives, but only a fraction of these people receive help, according to the National Eating Disorders Association. The company\u2019s offering brings care to those who don\u2019t live near an eating disorder facility or prefer to be treated online.\n\nFunding and valuation: Equip was last valued at $505 million and has secured a total of $135 million in funding from investors, including Optum Ventures and General Catalyst, according to PitchBook data.\n\nMaven\n\nWhat it does: The New York-based health clinic and benefits platform offers services for fertility, adoption, parenting, pediatrics and menopause through employers, including Microsoft and AT&T. Maven also serves Medicaid patients.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Investors say that 10-year-old Maven continues to grow, given that its area of focus \u2014 digital health services for women and families \u2014 has been historically underserved. While VC interest in women\u2019s health has grown in recent years, the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022 has shined an even brighter spotlight on the need for technologies that serve the female population.\n\nFunding and valuation: Since its founding, Maven has raised nearly $300 million in funding and was last valued in late 2022 at $1.35 billion in a Series E round led by General Catalyst with the participation of VCs, including Lux Capital, Oak HC/FT and Sequoia.\n\nMemora Health\n\nWhat it does: Memora Health offers virtual AI-based care coordination, reducing administrative burdens for medical staff. The company\u2019s technology uses text messages to communicate with patients, automating tasks like appointment reminders, answering patients\u2019 common questions and collecting data about symptoms and post-procedure recovery.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Like many other AI-based healthcare startups, Memora saves medical staff time. The company also helps patients feel more supported on their health journey.\n\nFunding: The company spun out of Harvard Innovation Lab and went through Y Combinator in 2018. Since then, it has raised nearly $80 million and was valued in April 2023 at $430 million, according to PitchBook data. Memora\u2019s investors include General Catalyst and Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nSmarterDx\n\nWhat it does: Founded in 2020, SmarterDx uses AI to help hospitals not miss out on revenues by analyzing patients\u2019 lab results, medications and doctors\u2019 notes to find minor errors and omissions in patients\u2019 diagnoses and associated medical codes. The company\u2019s technology reviews patient charts for accuracy before a claim is sent to health insurance or Medicare.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Investors say that since Smarter Dx helps health systems realize more revenues, the value of the company\u2019s technology is easy to measure.\n\nFunding: In May, SmarterDx raised a $50 million Series B round led by Transformation Capital, with participation from Bessemer Venture Partners, Flare Capital Partners and Floodgate Fund. The latest capital infusion brought the company\u2019s total funding to $71 million.\n\nSummer Health\n\nWhat it does: The two-year-old Summer Health connects parents to pediatricians who, within minutes, respond to urgent care and behavioral concerns. The company provides its text messaging service directly to consumers and through employers who offer access to Summer Health as a benefit.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Busy and worried parents want answers to their children\u2019s health issues right away and around the clock. Summer Health reduces parents\u2019 concerns because they can get fast responses to their questions via an app.\n\nFunding: In April, Summer Health raised its $12 million Series A led by 7wireVentures and existing investors including Sequoia, Lux Capital and Chelsea Clinton\u2019s Metrodora Ventures.\n\nTranscarent\n\nWhat it does: Four-year-old Transcarent helps large companies save money on providing health insurance to employees. The startup gives employees access to discounted medications, telehealth services and personalized AI-generated answers about their health coverage.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Part of the company\u2019s fast rise could be attributed to its founder, Glen Tullman, who previously started Livongo, a chronic condition management company Teledoc acquired for $18.5 billion in 2020.\n\nThe company also recently introduced an AI platform that answers members\u2019 questions about coverage, offers clinical information and connects them with medical staff as needed.\n\nFunding and valuation: In May, the company raised a $450 million Series D at a $2.2 billion valuation led by General Catalyst and 7wireVentures.", "authors": "['Marina Temkin']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-927809262.jpg?resize=1200,600", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/10-of-the-most-exciting-digital-health-startups-of-2024-according-to-vcs/", "timestamp": "1719365846.72545", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "Microsoft\u2019s Mustafa Suleyman says he loves Sam Altman, believes he\u2019s sincere about AI safety", "text": "In an interview at the Aspen Ideas Festival on Tuesday, Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, made it very clear that he admires OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\nCNBC\u2019s Andrew Ross Sorkin asked what the plan will be when Microsoft\u2019s enormous AI future isn\u2019t so closely dependent on OpenAI, using a metaphor of winning a bicycling race. But Suleyman sidestepped.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t buy the metaphor that there is a finish line. This is another false frame,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to stop framing everything as a ferocious race.\u201d\n\nHe then proceeded to toe the Microsoft corporate line about his company\u2019s arrangement with OpenAI, in which it invested a reported $10 billion through some combination of cash and cloud credits. The deal gives Microsoft a big stake in OpenAI\u2019s for-profit business, and allows it to embed its AI models into Microsoft wares and sell its tech to Microsoft cloud customers. Some reports indicate that Microsoft may also be entitled to some OpenAI payments.\n\n\u201cIt is true that we have ferocious competition with them,\u201d Suleyman said about OpenAI. \u201cThey are an independent company. We don\u2019t own or control them. We don\u2019t even have any board members. So they do entirely their own thing. But we have a deep partnership. I\u2019m very good friends with Sam, have huge respect and, trust and faith in what they\u2019ve done. And that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to roll for many, many years to come,\u201d Suleyman said.\n\nThis close/distant relationship is important for Suleyman to profess. Microsoft\u2019s investors and enterprise customers appreciate the close relationship. But regulators did get curious and in April, the EU agreed that its investment was not a true takeover. Should that change, in all likelihood so would the regulatory involvement.\n\nSuleyman says he trusts Altman on AI safety\n\nIn a sense, Suleyman was the Sam Altman of AI before OpenAI. He has spent most of his career in competition with OpenAI, and is known for his own ego.\n\nSuleyman was the founder of AI pioneer DeepMind and sold it to Google in 2014. He was reportedly put on administrative leave following allegations of bullying employees, as Bloomberg reported in 2019, then moved to other Google roles before leaving the company in 2022 to join Greylock Partners as a venture partner. A few months later, he and Greylock\u2019s Reid Hoffman, a Microsoft board member, launched Inflection AI to build its own LLM chatbot, among other goals.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella tried but failed to hire Sam Altman last fall, when OpenAI fired him and then quickly reinstated him. After that, Microsoft hired Suleyman and much of Inflection in March, leaving a shell of a company and a big check. In his new role at Microsoft, Suleyman has been auditing OpenAI code, Semafor reported earlier this month. As one of OpenAI\u2019s previous big rivals, he\u2019s now getting to dive deep inside the crown-jewel frenemy competitor.\n\nThere\u2019s yet another wrinkle to all of this. OpenAI was founded with a premise of doing AI safety research, to stop a one-day evil AI from destroying humankind. In 2023, when he was still an OpenAI competitor, Suleyman released a book called \u201cThe Coming Wave: Technology, Power and the 21st Century\u2019s Greatest Dilemma\u201d with researcher Michael Bhaskar. The book discusses the dangers of AI and how to prevent them.\n\nA group of former OpenAI employees signed a letter earlier this month outlining their fears that OpenAI and other AI companies are not taking safety seriously enough.\n\nWhen asked about that, Suleyman also proclaimed his love and trust for Altman, but also that he wants to see both regulation and a slower pace.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m a Brit with European tendencies, but I don\u2019t fear regulation in the way that sort of everyone seems to by default,\u201d he said, describing all of this fingerpointing by the former employees as a \u201chealthy dialogue.\u201d He added, \u201cI think it\u2019s a great thing that technologists and entrepreneurs and CEOs of companies like myself and Sam, who I love dearly and think is awesome\u201d are talking about regulation. \u201cHe is not cynical, he is sincere. He believes it genuinely.\u201d\n\nBut he also said, \u201cFriction is going to be our friend here. These technologies are becoming so powerful, they will be so intimate, they\u2019ll be so ever-present, that this is a moment where it\u2019s fine to take stock.\u201d If all of this dialog slows down AI development by six to 18 months or longer \u201cit\u2019s time well spent.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all very cozy between these players.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman Image Credits: TechCrunch\n\nSuleyman wants cooperation with China, AI in classrooms\n\nSuleyman also made some interesting comments on other issues. On the AI race with China:\n\n\u201cWith all due respect to my good friends in DC and the military industrial complex, if it\u2019s the default frame that it can only be a new Cold War, then that is exactly what it will be because it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. They will fear that we fear that we\u2019re going to be adversarial so they have to be adversarial and this is only going to escalate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to find ways to cooperate, be respectful of them, whilst also acknowledging that we have a different set of values.\u201d\n\nThen again, he also said that China is \u201cbuilding their own technology ecosystem, and they\u2019re spreading that around the world. We should really pay close attention.\u201d\n\nWhen asked his opinion on kids using AI for schoolwork, Suleyman, who said he doesn\u2019t have kids, shrugged it off. \u201cI think we have to be slightly careful about fearing the downside of every tool, you know, just as when calculators came in, there was a kind of this gut reaction, oh, no, everyone\u2019s gonna be able to sort of solve all the equations instantly. And it\u2019s gonna make us dumber because we weren\u2019t able to do mental arithmetic.\u201d\n\nHe also envisions a time, very soon, where AI is like a teacher\u2019s aide, perhaps chatting live in the classroom, as AI\u2019s verbal skills improve. \u201cWhat would it look like for a great teacher or educator to have a profound conversation with an AI that is live and in front of their audience?\u201d\n\nThe upshot takeaway is that, if we want the people who are building and profiting from AI to govern and protect humanity from its worst effects, we may be setting unrealistic expectations.", "authors": "['Julie Bort']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Microsoft-AI-CEO-Mustafa-Suleyman.png?resize=1200,624", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/microsofts-mustafa-suleyman-says-he-loves-sam-altman-believes-hes-sincere-about-ai-safety/", "timestamp": "1719365851.214423", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "10 of the most exciting digital health startups of 2024, according to VCs", "text": "In the post-COVID world, VCs say it\u2019s not as easy to get excited about investing in digital health. Deal activity in healthcare IT was relatively flat in Q1 2024 at 74 total deals, valued at about $1 billion total, up only 3% from the year-ago quarter, according to PitchBook data.\n\nStill, promising startups have grabbed investors\u2019 attention this year. TechCrunch spoke with about a dozen healthcare VCs about the companies they think have the most promising future. While recently formed AI-driven startups that are solving staggering administrative challenges in the U.S. healthcare system dominated their recommendations, they also mentioned several slightly older, non-AI-focused businesses.\n\nWe narrowed their suggestions to the list of names that more than one VC mentioned, which came in at an even 10 companies. VCs discussed with us the companies that were both in their portfolios and not.\n\nAbridge\n\nWhat it does: Uses AI to automate medical records based on conversations between doctors and patients.\n\nFounded in 2018 by Shiv Rao, a practicing cardiologist, Abridge is an early entrant into the medical note-taking space and one that has secured integration with the all-powerful Epic Systems health records software.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: The Pittsburgh-based startup generates excitement among investors and hospital systems eager to free up physicians\u2019 time spent on note-taking. Abridge is the health tech startup that among investors we talked to was mentioned the most.\n\nSome investors said that Abridge is leading its category. Other companies competing to dominate the AI-powered medical note-taking market include Ambience, Nabla, Microsoft-owned Nuance and Suki.\n\nFunding: In February, Abridge raised a $150 million Series C led by Lightspeed Ventures at a valuation of $850 million, a mere four months after the virtual medical scribe startup grabbed a $30 million Series B from Spark Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners, CVS Health Ventures and others.\n\nCodaMetrix\n\nWhat it does: Founded in 2019, CodaMetrix uses AI to automate medical coding. The company\u2019s technology translates medical notes stored in electronic health records into diagnostic codes, helping to reduce errors and administrative burdens.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Medical coding is tedious and error-prone. Entering an incorrect code for a condition or treatment can lead to insurance rejection of claims and other administrative problems. Moreover, the burden of entering codes falls on already busy physicians and nurses, leading to increased stress and burnout.\n\nThe company has competitors, including Fathom Health, but investors say that CodaMetrix has one of the largest annotated coding datasets.\n\nFunding and valuation: In March, CodaMetrix grabbed a $40 million Series B from Transformation Capital with participation of returning investors SignalFire and Cressey Ventures. The deal valued the Boston-based company at $220 million, according to PitchBook.\n\nCohere Health\n\nWhat it does: Cohere Health expedites health insurance approval process, known as prior authorization, for medical conditions with the help of AI.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Prior authorization management could take medical and administrative staff hours as it requires gathering appropriate documentation for submission to health insurers or Medicaid. Cohere Health\u2019s AI can reduce the time it takes to do this to minutes, saving medical and administrative staff hours on these tasks.\n\nInvestors say that Cohere is for now the leader in the space, but other startups that expedite health insurance approval for medical conditions include Anterior and Alaffia Health.\n\nFunding: Cohere Health raised a $50 million Series B earlier this year from Deerfield Management with participation from Define Ventures, Polaris Partners, Longitude Capital and Flare Capital Partners.\n\nGrow Therapy\n\nWhat it does: Grow Therapy connects therapists who want to start independent practices with patients and insurers. Founded in 2020, the startup employs the so-called business-in-box model because it gives mental health professionals tools for filing claims, receiving payments and being matched with patients.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: The company claims that its business model offers therapists more flexibility than if they were to provide their services through marketplaces like Headway or Lyra. While it\u2019s not clear whether that\u2019s indeed the case, Grow, true to its name, is growing fast, investors say.\n\nFunding and valaution: In April, Grow closed an $88 million Series C led by Sequoia at a $1.4 billion valuation, according to PitchBook data.\n\nEquip\n\nWhat it does: Four-year-old Equip provides online treatment for kids, teens and adults in all 50 states and accepts most health insurances. Equip providers are also trained to address co-occurring conditions like anxiety, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: About 10% of the U.S. population develops an eating disorder during their lives, but only a fraction of these people receive help, according to the National Eating Disorders Association. The company\u2019s offering brings care to those who don\u2019t live near an eating disorder facility or prefer to be treated online.\n\nFunding and valuation: Equip was last valued at $505 million and has secured a total of $135 million in funding from investors, including Optum Ventures and General Catalyst, according to PitchBook data.\n\nMaven\n\nWhat it does: The New York-based health clinic and benefits platform offers services for fertility, adoption, parenting, pediatrics and menopause through employers, including Microsoft and AT&T. Maven also serves Medicaid patients.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Investors say that 10-year-old Maven continues to grow, given that its area of focus \u2014 digital health services for women and families \u2014 has been historically underserved. While VC interest in women\u2019s health has grown in recent years, the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022 has shined an even brighter spotlight on the need for technologies that serve the female population.\n\nFunding and valuation: Since its founding, Maven has raised nearly $300 million in funding and was last valued in late 2022 at $1.35 billion in a Series E round led by General Catalyst with the participation of VCs, including Lux Capital, Oak HC/FT and Sequoia.\n\nMemora Health\n\nWhat it does: Memora Health offers virtual AI-based care coordination, reducing administrative burdens for medical staff. The company\u2019s technology uses text messages to communicate with patients, automating tasks like appointment reminders, answering patients\u2019 common questions and collecting data about symptoms and post-procedure recovery.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Like many other AI-based healthcare startups, Memora saves medical staff time. The company also helps patients feel more supported on their health journey.\n\nFunding: The company spun out of Harvard Innovation Lab and went through Y Combinator in 2018. Since then, it has raised nearly $80 million and was valued in April 2023 at $430 million, according to PitchBook data. Memora\u2019s investors include General Catalyst and Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nSmarterDx\n\nWhat it does: Founded in 2020, SmarterDx uses AI to help hospitals not miss out on revenues by analyzing patients\u2019 lab results, medications and doctors\u2019 notes to find minor errors and omissions in patients\u2019 diagnoses and associated medical codes. The company\u2019s technology reviews patient charts for accuracy before a claim is sent to health insurance or Medicare.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Investors say that since Smarter Dx helps health systems realize more revenues, the value of the company\u2019s technology is easy to measure.\n\nFunding: In May, SmarterDx raised a $50 million Series B round led by Transformation Capital, with participation from Bessemer Venture Partners, Flare Capital Partners and Floodgate Fund. The latest capital infusion brought the company\u2019s total funding to $71 million.\n\nSummer Health\n\nWhat it does: The two-year-old Summer Health connects parents to pediatricians who, within minutes, respond to urgent care and behavioral concerns. The company provides its text messaging service directly to consumers and through employers who offer access to Summer Health as a benefit.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Busy and worried parents want answers to their children\u2019s health issues right away and around the clock. Summer Health reduces parents\u2019 concerns because they can get fast responses to their questions via an app.\n\nFunding: In April, Summer Health raised its $12 million Series A led by 7wireVentures and existing investors including Sequoia, Lux Capital and Chelsea Clinton\u2019s Metrodora Ventures.\n\nTranscarent\n\nWhat it does: Four-year-old Transcarent helps large companies save money on providing health insurance to employees. The startup gives employees access to discounted medications, telehealth services and personalized AI-generated answers about their health coverage.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Part of the company\u2019s fast rise could be attributed to its founder, Glen Tullman, who previously started Livongo, a chronic condition management company Teledoc acquired for $18.5 billion in 2020.\n\nThe company also recently introduced an AI platform that answers members\u2019 questions about coverage, offers clinical information and connects them with medical staff as needed.\n\nFunding and valuation: In May, the company raised a $450 million Series D at a $2.2 billion valuation led by General Catalyst and 7wireVentures.", "authors": "['Marina Temkin']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-927809262.jpg?resize=1200,600", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/10-of-the-most-exciting-digital-health-startups-of-2024-according-to-vcs/", "timestamp": "1719365858.25574", "displayed": 0}

The deal valued the Boston-based company at $220 million, according to PitchBook.\n\nCohere Health\n\nWhat it does: Cohere Health expedites health insurance approval process, known as prior authorization, for medical conditions with the help of AI.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Prior authorization management could take medical and administrative staff hours as it requires gathering appropriate documentation for submission to health insurers or Medicaid. Cohere Health\u2019s AI can reduce the time it takes to do this to minutes, saving medical and administrative staff hours on these tasks.\n\nInvestors say that Cohere is for now the leader in the space, but other startups that expedite health insurance approval for medical conditions include Anterior and Alaffia Health.\n\nFunding: Cohere Health raised a $50 million Series B earlier this year from Deerfield Management with participation from Define Ventures, Polaris Partners, Longitude Capital and Flare Capital Partners.\n\nGrow Therapy\n\nWhat it does: Grow Therapy connects therapists who want to start independent practices with patients and insurers. Founded in 2020, the startup employs the so-called business-in-box model because it gives mental health professionals tools for filing claims, receiving payments and being matched with patients.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: The company claims that its business model offers therapists more flexibility than if they were to provide their services through marketplaces like Headway or Lyra. While it\u2019s not clear whether that\u2019s indeed the case, Grow, true to its name, is growing fast, investors say.\n\nFunding and valaution: In April, Grow closed an $88 million Series C led by Sequoia at a $1.4 billion valuation, according to PitchBook data.\n\nEquip\n\nWhat it does: Four-year-old Equip provides online treatment for kids, teens and adults in all 50 states and accepts most health insurances. Equip providers are also trained to address co-occurring conditions like anxiety, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: About 10% of the U.S. population develops an eating disorder during their lives, but only a fraction of these people receive help, according to the National Eating Disorders Association. The company\u2019s offering brings care to those who don\u2019t live near an eating disorder facility or prefer to be treated online.\n\nFunding and valuation: Equip was last valued at $505 million and has secured a total of $135 million in funding from investors, including Optum Ventures and General Catalyst, according to PitchBook data.\n\nMaven\n\nWhat it does: The New York-based health clinic and benefits platform offers services for fertility, adoption, parenting, pediatrics and menopause through employers, including Microsoft and AT&T. Maven also serves Medicaid patients.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Investors say that 10-year-old Maven continues to grow, given that its area of focus \u2014 digital health services for women and families \u2014 has been historically underserved. While VC interest in women\u2019s health has grown in recent years, the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022 has shined an even brighter spotlight on the need for technologies that serve the female population.\n\nFunding and valuation: Since its founding, Maven has raised nearly $300 million in funding and was last valued in late 2022 at $1.35 billion in a Series E round led by General Catalyst with the participation of VCs, including Lux Capital, Oak HC/FT and Sequoia.\n\nMemora Health\n\nWhat it does: Memora Health offers virtual AI-based care coordination, reducing administrative burdens for medical staff. The company\u2019s technology uses text messages to communicate with patients, automating tasks like appointment reminders, answering patients\u2019 common questions and collecting data about symptoms and post-procedure recovery.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Like many other AI-based healthcare startups, Memora saves medical staff time. The company also helps patients feel more supported on their health journey.\n\nFunding: The company spun out of Harvard Innovation Lab and went through Y Combinator in 2018. Since then, it has raised nearly $80 million and was valued in April 2023 at $430 million, according to PitchBook data. Memora\u2019s investors include General Catalyst and Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nSmarterDx\n\nWhat it does: Founded in 2020, SmarterDx uses AI to help hospitals not miss out on revenues by analyzing patients\u2019 lab results, medications and doctors\u2019 notes to find minor errors and omissions in patients\u2019 diagnoses and associated medical codes. The company\u2019s technology reviews patient charts for accuracy before a claim is sent to health insurance or Medicare.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Investors say that since Smarter Dx helps health systems realize more revenues, the value of the company\u2019s technology is easy to measure.\n\nFunding: In May, SmarterDx raised a $50 million Series B round led by Transformation Capital, with participation from Bessemer Venture Partners, Flare Capital Partners and Floodgate Fund. The latest capital infusion brought the company\u2019s total funding to $71 million.\n\nSummer Health\n\nWhat it does: The two-year-old Summer Health connects parents to pediatricians who, within minutes, respond to urgent care and behavioral concerns. The company provides its text messaging service directly to consumers and through employers who offer access to Summer Health as a benefit.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Busy and worried parents want answers to their children\u2019s health issues right away and around the clock. Summer Health reduces parents\u2019 concerns because they can get fast responses to their questions via an app.\n\nFunding: In April, Summer Health raised its $12 million Series A led by 7wireVentures and existing investors including Sequoia, Lux Capital and Chelsea Clinton\u2019s Metrodora Ventures.\n\nTranscarent\n\nWhat it does: Four-year-old Transcarent helps large companies save money on providing health insurance to employees. The startup gives employees access to discounted medications, telehealth services and personalized AI-generated answers about their health coverage.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Part of the company\u2019s fast rise could be attributed to its founder, Glen Tullman, who previously started Livongo, a chronic condition management company Teledoc acquired for $18.5 billion in 2020.\n\nThe company also recently introduced an AI platform that answers members\u2019 questions about coverage, offers clinical information and connects them with medical staff as needed.\n\nFunding and valuation: In May, the company raised a $450 million Series D at a $2.2 billion valuation led by General Catalyst and 7wireVentures.", "authors": "['Marina Temkin']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-927809262.jpg?resize=1200,600", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/10-of-the-most-exciting-digital-health-startups-of-2024-according-to-vcs/", "timestamp": "1719365862.211561", "displayed": 0}
{"title": "Welcome to the fediverse: Your guide to Mastodon, Threads, Bluesky, and more", "text": "From tiny acorns to a digital forest, here\u2019s everything you need to know about the fediverse\n\nOnce upon a time, in a galaxy not so far away (this one, in fact), a few internet rebels decided that they were tired of the corporate overlords controlling their online lives. Thus, the fediverse was born \u2014 an attempt to wrest control of microblogging services, such as Twitter and its ilk, away from centralized powers and into the hands of the people.\n\nThe term \u201cfediverse\u201d combines \u201cfederation\u201d and \u201cuniverse.\u201d In a nutshell, it\u2019s a collection of social networking services that can communicate with each other (formally known as federation).\n\nThe fediverse roots trace back to the 2000s, with the rise of projects like StatusNet, which later evolved into GNU social. The big bang happened in 2016 when Mastodon, an open-source microblogging platform, entered the scene. Since then, myriad decentralized platforms have sprouted, including Bluesky, Threads, and Pleroma, each with its unique flavor, all united by their disdain for Big Tech\u2019s centralized control.\n\nGNU Social and StatusNet were the pioneers. They aimed to create a more open and free web, where users controlled their data and interactions. StatusNet\u2019s most notable instance, identi.ca, was an early example of a federated social network. However, these platforms struggled to gain mainstream traction due to technical complexity and limited user bases \u2013 kinda like the early days of crypto, come to think of it.\n\nThen, in 2016, Mastodon entered the scene. It was created by Eugen Rochko, a Russia-born software developer who decamped to Germany. With a familiar interface and an emphasis on user experience, Mastodon quickly became the poster child of the fediverse. Its success lay in balancing decentralization with usability, attracting users tired of Twitter\u2019s toxic environment and draconian policies. Mastodon\u2019s growth was exponential, sparking interest and spawning numerous other fediverse projects.\n\nWhy the fediverse could be the next big thing in social media\n\nThe fediverse isn\u2019t just another social media platform; it\u2019s a rallying cry and a manifesto of sorts. Here are a few reasons why its fans believe it\u2019s the next big thing:\n\nPower to the people: With decentralization as its rallying cry, no single entity controls the fediverse. It\u2019s like the Wild West but with fewer guns and (a lot) more memes. This decentralization means users have more control over their data and interactions. Each server operates independently yet can still communicate with others, creating a vast, interconnected network. This structure prevents the concentration of power and mitigates the risks associated with data breaches and surveillance.\n\nYour data, your rules: Privacy often plays a big part in the conversation around the fediverse. Unlike certain social media giants, fediverse platforms claim they don\u2019t sell your data to the highest bidder. Many instances prioritize user privacy, with policies prohibiting data mining and tracking. Users can choose servers with privacy-focused practices and even host their own instances for maximum control. This approach appeals to those concerned about their digital footprint and the pervasive surveillance of corporate social media.\n\nLike the OG internet: The fediverse fosters small, tight-knit communities where you can actually have meaningful conversations instead of screaming into the void. Each server often caters to specific interests or values, enabling users to find like-minded individuals. This community-centric approach contrasts sharply with the global, often chaotic nature of platforms like Twitter and Facebook, where meaningful interactions are buried under a deluge of noise.\n\nHave it your way: If your perfect blend of spices doesn\u2019t exist, you can make your own: The software is open-source, so you can go ham with the hacking. Want a purple interface where all posts are automatically translated into Klingon? You do you, boo. The fediverse\u2019s flexibility allows users to customize their experiences, from interface design to functionality. Developers can create and share modifications, enhancing the platform\u2019s capabilities and fostering innovation. This adaptability \u2014 at least in theory \u2014 ensures that the fediverse evolves with its users, staying relevant and responsive to their needs.\n\nKey players in the fediverse\n\nThe fediverse is kinda like \u201cBeing John Malkovich\u201d in that there are a lot of actors, but they all kind of look alike. This is where a lot of the confusion comes from. Here are some of the key players worth being aware of:\n\nMastodon is an open-source, decentralized social network within the broader fediverse. It enables users to create and join independent, interconnected communities or instances governed by rules and moderation policies. This structure promotes user autonomy and content diversity while reducing reliance on centralized control. By offering a more user-centric alternative to traditional social media platforms, Mastodon has long been a key player and plays a crucial role in the fediverse, fostering a collaborative and resilient digital landscape emphasizing privacy, free expression, and community-driven interaction.\n\nBluesky (bsky among friends) is an interesting player in this space. As a brainchild of Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, Bluesky\u2019s focus on open protocols aims to dismantle the monopolistic hold of major social media companies. Focusing on commitment to interoperability and user control differentiates it from other fediverse platforms, making it a pioneering force in the push toward a more liberated and equitable online landscape.\n\nThreads is Meta\u2019s runner in the fediverse race. It uses the ActivityPub protocol, which lets Threads fly the platform interoperability flag the fediverse is known for \u2013 although Meta has received some criticism for being slow to fully participate. Still, with the weight of Meta behind it, Threads positions itself as a key player in the evolution of a more connected and diverse online ecosystem.\n\nPleroma is another microblogging platform, similar to Mastodon but lighter and more customizable. Developed by Lain and based on the Elixir programming language, Pleroma offers greater flexibility and performance. It\u2019s a favorite among tech-savvy users who want more control over their social media experience. Pleroma\u2019s modularity allows it to integrate various features from other platforms, making it a versatile choice for those looking to escape the mainstream.\n\nFor those who love Instagram but hate its corporate antics, Pixelfed is the answer. This photo-sharing platform focuses on privacy and user control. It offers a familiar interface, complete with filters and photo albums, but without the ads and algorithms pushing sponsored content. Pixelfed is perfect for photographers, artists and anyone who wants to share visual content without the noise of traditional social media.\n\nFriendica, meanwhile, is a versatile platform that can connect with almost any other social network. It supports many protocols, including ActivityPub (used by Mastodon and Pleroma), Diaspora, and even old-school protocols like RSS. Friendica is a great choice for users who want to bridge the gap between the fediverse and traditional social media platforms. Its flexibility and integration capabilities make it the ultimate social network aggregator.\n\nYouTube\u2019s video-sharing dominance is undeniable, but PeerTube offers a decentralized alternative. Developed by Framasoft, PeerTube enables users to host their own video servers, interconnecting with other instances to share content. This decentralization ensures that no single entity controls the platform, promoting free speech and diverse content. PeerTube is often held up as the ideal for creators who value independence and want to escape the ad-driven, algorithmic world of YouTube.\n\nWait, are there really no downsides to the fediverse?\n\nWelllll\u2026 Of course, it\u2019s not all rainbows and unicorns. The fediverse has its own set of issues and growing pains\n\nToo many cooks. With great power comes great responsibility. In this case, a million tiny servers, each with its own rules. This fragmentation can make the fediverse feel disjointed, with varying levels of quality and user experience. Navigating this landscape can confuse newcomers who may struggle to find the right instance or understand the platform\u2019s nuances. While diversity is a strength, it also presents challenges regarding coherence and user adoption.\n\nOnly the tech-savvy need apply? Setting up and maintaining your own server can be a headache unless you\u2019re a tech wizard, and the \u201conly nerds may apply\u201d vibe runs strong. The technical barrier to entry can be daunting, deterring less tech-savvy users from fully engaging with the fediverse. While user-friendly instances exist, the overall complexity remains a hurdle for widespread adoption. Simplifying the user experience and lowering technical barriers will be crucial for the fediverse\u2019s growth.\n\nThe popular kid on the block. Some platforms struggle under the weight of their own popularity. Growing pains, they call it, which makes sense, but it doubles down on the tech-savvy vibe from above: Instances can become overwhelmed by a sudden influx of users, leading to performance issues and downtime for folks who are least likely to tolerate (or know what to do with) sudden downtime. This scalability problem highlights the challenges of maintaining decentralized networks without the resources of corporate giants. Balancing growth and stability will be essential for the fediverse\u2019s sustainability \u2014 and continue to be one of its biggest stumbling blocks.\n\nWait, what\u2019s with all the racism? Without a central authority, content moderation can be hit or miss. And let\u2019s be honest, especially in the early days, users are experiencing more misses than hits. Each instance sets its own moderation policies, leading to inconsistencies and potential conflicts. While this allows for diverse community standards, it also means that harmful content can proliferate on poorly moderated servers. Anyone who\u2019s run a popular social network knows that effective and consistent moderation is critical to ensuring safe and welcoming environments, but achieving this across a decentralized network is\u2026 let\u2019s call it \u201can unsolved challenge.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next for the fediverse?\n\nLemme bust out the crystal ball and see if I can come up with some predictions. Will it overthrow the social media titans and usher in a new era of digital utopia? Probably not \u2014 or at least not for a while. But there is hope for it to play to its strengths and continue to grow as a haven for those tired of being commodified by Big Tech.\n\nI expect more platforms to join the fray, each more niche than the last. The fediverse\u2019s open nature encourages innovation, and we can anticipate a proliferation of new projects catering to specific communities and interests. This diversity will enrich the ecosystem, offering users more choices and fostering a vibrant digital culture. However, it will also exacerbate the challenges of fragmentation and interoperability.\n\nIndeed, the way that these platforms talk to each other is through various protocols, which, let\u2019s be frank, only a handful of people will understand or care about. ActivityPub currently dominates the fediverse, but other protocols like Zot and Diaspora have their proponents. In the future, we will likely see ongoing efforts to improve and standardize these protocols, enhancing cross-platform communication and integration. This technical evolution will be crucial for the fediverse\u2019s cohesion and growth.\n\nMainstream adoption remains a significant challenge. There is a handful of extremely popular microblogging platforms, all of which are significant competitors to the fediverse. Its complex nature and decentralized ethos may deter the average user accustomed to the simplicity and familiarity of corporate social media. To attract a broader audience, the fediverse will have to find a way to streamline its user experience, improve accessibility and offer compelling alternatives to mainstream platforms. Collaboration with privacy advocates, open-source communities and digital rights organizations could also help raise awareness and drive adoption.\n\nIn the long run, it\u2019s going to be interesting to see how the tech giants respond. As the fediverse gains traction, it\u2019s only a matter of time before the usual suspects start to pay notice (Meta, Google, X, Amazon \u2013 yes, I\u2019m looking at y\u2019all). While this could bring resources and attention, it also risks undermining the very principles that define the fediverse. The community will have to navigate these waters carefully, balancing growth with integrity.\n\nAll we are is another click in the wall\n\nIn the end, the fediverse will probably remain a quirky, fragmented and occasionally frustrating part of the internet. But it\u2019s a digital home worth exploring for those who value privacy, community and control. Don\u2019t forget to bring your sense of adventure \u2014 and maybe a manual on setting up servers.\n\nThe most exciting thing about the fediverse is that it ain\u2019t about perfection; it\u2019s about possibilities and counter-culture. It\u2019s a grand experiment in what the internet could be \u2014 free from the monopolistic tendencies of Big Tech, driven by community values, and open to endless innovation. So, whether you\u2019re a tech enthusiast, a privacy advocate or just someone tired of the same old social media grind, give the fediverse a shot.

Will it overthrow the social media titans and usher in a new era of digital utopia? Probably not \u2014 or at least not for a while. But there is hope for it to play to its strengths and continue to grow as a haven for those tired of being commodified by Big Tech.\n\nI expect more platforms to join the fray, each more niche than the last. The fediverse\u2019s open nature encourages innovation, and we can anticipate a proliferation of new projects catering to specific communities and interests. This diversity will enrich the ecosystem, offering users more choices and fostering a vibrant digital culture. However, it will also exacerbate the challenges of fragmentation and interoperability.\n\nIndeed, the way that these platforms talk to each other is through various protocols, which, let\u2019s be frank, only a handful of people will understand or care about. ActivityPub currently dominates the fediverse, but other protocols like Zot and Diaspora have their proponents. In the future, we will likely see ongoing efforts to improve and standardize these protocols, enhancing cross-platform communication and integration. This technical evolution will be crucial for the fediverse\u2019s cohesion and growth.\n\nMainstream adoption remains a significant challenge. There is a handful of extremely popular microblogging platforms, all of which are significant competitors to the fediverse. Its complex nature and decentralized ethos may deter the average user accustomed to the simplicity and familiarity of corporate social media. To attract a broader audience, the fediverse will have to find a way to streamline its user experience, improve accessibility and offer compelling alternatives to mainstream platforms. Collaboration with privacy advocates, open-source communities and digital rights organizations could also help raise awareness and drive adoption.\n\nIn the long run, it\u2019s going to be interesting to see how the tech giants respond. As the fediverse gains traction, it\u2019s only a matter of time before the usual suspects start to pay notice (Meta, Google, X, Amazon \u2013 yes, I\u2019m looking at y\u2019all). While this could bring resources and attention, it also risks undermining the very principles that define the fediverse. The community will have to navigate these waters carefully, balancing growth with integrity.\n\nAll we are is another click in the wall\n\nIn the end, the fediverse will probably remain a quirky, fragmented and occasionally frustrating part of the internet. But it\u2019s a digital home worth exploring for those who value privacy, community and control. Don\u2019t forget to bring your sense of adventure \u2014 and maybe a manual on setting up servers.\n\nThe most exciting thing about the fediverse is that it ain\u2019t about perfection; it\u2019s about possibilities and counter-culture. It\u2019s a grand experiment in what the internet could be \u2014 free from the monopolistic tendencies of Big Tech, driven by community values, and open to endless innovation. So, whether you\u2019re a tech enthusiast, a privacy advocate or just someone tired of the same old social media grind, give the fediverse a shot. The potential win is the chance of finding your digital tribe among the chaos.", "authors": "['Haje Jan Kamps']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/fediverse-logos-general.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/welcome-to-the-fediverse-your-guide-to-mastodon-threads-bluesky-and-more/", "timestamp": "1719365868.398575", "displayed": 0}

Once launched, ChatGPT appears as a chat interface overlaid on top of the screen.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s launch of the macOS app was a bit overshadowed at the time of the original announcement, as it arrived alongside GPT-4o, its flagship generative AI model that promises more advanced intelligence, including the ability to handle not only text and speech but also video.

The company noted at the time that it could be called up with the simple keyboard shortcut and users could also take and discuss screenshots directly in the app. Users can upload files and other photos via the macOS app, too, as well as speak to ChatGPT from their desktop and search through their past conversations.\n\nThe app had been slowly rolling out to Mac users, starting with Plus subscribers, but today the company announced in a post on X that it\u2019s now available to everyone.\n\nThis isn\u2019t OpenAI\u2019s only integration with Apple devices.

But instead of more traditional search, they\u2019ll have access to a wider world of knowledge, only one button away. Once launched, ChatGPT appears as a chat interface overlaid on top of the screen.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s launch of the macOS app was a bit overshadowed at the time of the original announcement, as it arrived alongside GPT-4o, its flagship generative AI model that promises more advanced intelligence, including the ability to handle not only text and speech but also video. (Its multimodal capabilities and ability to understand media give the AI model its name; the \u201co\u201d stands for \u201comni.\u201d)\n\nChatGPT\u2019s desktop app was announced in the same press release, as a new app for both free and paid users. The company noted at the time that it could be called up with the simple keyboard shortcut and users could also take and discuss screenshots directly in the app. Users can upload files and other photos via the macOS app, too, as well as speak to ChatGPT from their desktop and search through their past conversations.\n\nThe app had been slowly rolling out to Mac users, starting with Plus subscribers, but today the company announced in a post on X that it\u2019s now available to everyone.\n\nThis isn\u2019t OpenAI\u2019s only integration with Apple devices. At WWDC, the companies announced a more expansive deal that will also see Apple customers gaining access to ChatGPT from their iPhones and iPads, including through Siri and within other areas that could be aided by AI, like Writing Tools. These integrations are also powered by GPT-4o and will roll out to Apple customers later this year with the launch of Apple\u2019s newest operating systems.", "authors": "['Sarah Perez']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/chatgpt-mac.jpg?resize=1200,672", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/chatgpt-for-mac-is-now-available-to-all/", "timestamp": "1719365894.572178", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "VW to invest up to $5B in Rivian software deal", "text": "Volkswagen Group said Tuesday it will invest $1 billion into EV startup Rivian as part of a broad software development deal that could expand to as much as $5 billion.\n\nIt\u2019s a boon for Rivian, which has a tenuous path ahead as it pushes to develop its mass-market R2 SUV. The company\u2019s shares shot up more than 36% in after-hours trading.\n\nBut it also gives Volkswagen another option for advancing its own software chops \u2014 something it has struggled mightily with during this mass transition to electric vehicles.\n\nAs part of the deal, the two companies will create a joint venture to develop and grow the technology. It will be a 50-50 partnership with co-CEOs, who will report into both Rivian and Volkswagen Group. Rivian will share its electrical architecture expertise with VW and is expected to license existing intellectual property rights to the joint venture.\n\nThat arrangement will give Volkswagen access to Rivian\u2019s existing electrical architecture and software platform. All Volkswagen Group subsidiaries are included in this deal, which could bring Rivian DNA into storied brands like Porsche and Audi and even the conglomerate\u2019s own EV upstart, Scout Motors.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the joint venture will sell its tech to other companies down the road, too. \u201cBut we have a lot to do in the short-term,\u201d Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe said on a conference call. \u201cWe have a lot of products to work on, and so we are absolutely eyes-on-the-prize focused on the products within Rivian\u2019s portfolio, within Volkswagen Group\u2019s portfolio, and I\u2019d say [we] couldn\u2019t be more excited about what\u2019s to come.\u201d\n\nInitially, Volkswagen will invest $1 billion into Rivian via an unsecured convertible note that will convert into Rivian\u2019s common stock once certain regulatory approvals are received. That\u2019s expected to happen in the fourth quarter of this year. The German auto giant will then buy another $1 billion of Rivian\u2019s common stock in each of 2025 and 2026. The remaining $2 billion will go to the joint venture, split between an initial investment and a loan in 2026.\n\nScaringe wouldn\u2019t say exactly when the two companies began hashing out the idea of collaborating. But he said the conversation started when he met with Volkswagen Group CEO Oliver Blume at Porsche\u2019s Experience Center in Atlanta, Georgia \u2014 the same state where Rivian plans to build a factory.\n\n\u201cI grew up a massive Porsche enthusiast. I restored classic 356s, and I\u2019ve owned all sorts of interesting products from the Porsche/Volkswagen family, so there was immediate realization that we have some shared vehicle interests,\u201d he said. \u201cBut quickly that led to a serious conversation to say, how can we look at working together?\u201d\n\nBlume echoed that sentiment on the call. \u201cFrom the first moment on, there was a very good feeling between us, the same mindset, same interests. And our business is a people business, and when you understand each other, then you will be successful,\u201d he said, adding that Rivian is \u201cvery agile with experience on modern software.\u201d\n\nThe news comes just weeks after Rivian started producing the next-generation of its R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV, an upgrade that reworked the guts of its vehicles, changing everything from the battery pack and suspension system to the electrical architecture, interior seats and sensor stack. Rivian\u2019s new electrical architecture and compute platform reduced the number of electronic control units (ECUs) used to control the vehicle from 17 different ECUs in its first generation to seven. This new zonal architecture allows Rivian to cut more than 1.6 miles of wiring from each vehicle \u2014 a 44-pound weight savings \u2014 and to build its vehicles faster.\n\nThat new electrical architecture \u2014 or what Scaringe describes as new vehicle topography \u2014 is seen internally as a key innovation at Rivian and one that allows the company to wirelessly update software. The new zonal architecture supports Rivian\u2019s software stack, which was also developed and deployed in-house. That software stack includes everything related to real-time operating systems (RTOS) that manage the car, such as thermal dynamics, ADAS and safety systems, as well as another layer related to the infotainment system.\n\nRivian and Tesla both use a zonal architecture \u2014 which many believe is the foundation to what the industry calls software-defined vehicles. Software-defined vehicles also offer automakers an opportunity to add revenue streams via in-car entertainment and services. In 2021, VW Group said Cariad could generate as much as \u20ac1.2 trillion ($1.4 trillion) in revenue by 2030, via subscriptions and other sales.\n\nVW has long professed a goal to bring advanced software that is easy to update to its entire portfolio. But the company, and its software unit Cariad, has been plagued with delays and executive shakeups. Last October, VW Group\u2019s board approved restructuring Cariad, a move that included cutting as many as 2,000 workers and further delayed the launch of VW\u2019s software architecture 1.2 by 16 to 18 months.\n\nThe software 1.2. platform, which was being developed for the Porsche Macan EV and the Audi Q6 E-Tron, was originally scheduled for completion in 2022.

{"title": "Fearless Fund\u2019s founder has resigned, and it\u2019s a sad reflection on the VC world for Black women", "text": "On Monday, Fearless Fund\u2019s co-founder Ayana Parsons announced that she was stepping down from her leadership role from the firm. She will no longer be its general partner and COO but will be off \u201cenjoying island life\u201d with her family, she said in a LinkedIn post. She co-founded the fund in 2019 with partner Arian Simone, who remains its CEO.\n\nFearless Fund was founded with a mission to provide venture capital financing, grants and financial education to startups founded by Black women. That\u2019s a demographic that is both particularly underserved and promising. Less than 1% of all VC dollars in 2023 went to Black-founded startups, which amounts to around $661 million out of $136 billion, according to Crunchbase data.\n\nSo Fearless Fund is doing exactly what venture capitalists are supposed to do: find an overlooked area (in Silicon Valley they might call it taking a \u201ccontrarian view\u201d) and invest. The fund has so far invested $26 million into over 40 companies that include Slutty Vegan, The Lip Bar, Partake Foods, and Live Tinted, Atlanta Daily World reports.\n\nThe money invested and granted is from private limited partners. The LPs who supported the fund want to support this thesis. The companies receiving money are still private startups. Since so little classic VC funding is going to these businesses, the community is building their own rails. Everyone in this ecosystem is OK with this.\n\nStill, it is being sued by a politically conservative group called the American Alliance for Equal Rights (AAER) over its charitable grants program. AAER is challenging the fund\u2019s right to provide $20,000 in small business grants to Black women, claiming the program violates the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which bans the use of race in contracts.\n\nAAER was founded by Edward Blum, an activist who helped successfully overturn affirmative action in universities and is now conducting several other lawsuits in similar veins (e.g., the AAER is currently suing the Smithsonian Institute\u2019s Latino Museum Studies Program for hiring Latino interns).\n\nThe case is not going particularly well for Fearless Fund. As TechCrunch recently reported, earlier this month an appeals court ruled against Fearless. It upheld a preliminary injunction that prevents the firm from making grants to Black women business owners. The firm told TechCrunch at that time it is weighing its options on how to proceed.\n\nLast year, when the case made national news, numerous founders and investors told TechCrunch about the infuriating irony of using the Civil Rights Act of 1866 to protest the firm\u2019s program, as it was initially put into place to help the formerly enslaved and is now being used against the community it sought to help.\n\nIn the months that followed, the frustration of this case within the community has not lessened. Earlier on Monday, Parsons had an emotional moment onstage at the ForbesBLK Summit in Atlanta. She was joined by political leader Stacey Abrams and the chief diversity officer of Congress, Dr. Sesha Joi Moon.\n\n\u201cAnytime you are surrounded by Black women, they are going to pour into you,\u2019\u2019 Parsons said, according to Forbes. \u201cSo, when I walked on this stage, these eyes were watering because they understood the heavy burden that is on all of us in this country.\u2019\u2019\n\nAfter announcing her resignation, Parsons told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and her spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the lawsuit against Fearless was not a motivating factor. But she did not otherwise explain her decision to leave. She also remains an investor in the fund. \u201cAs co-founder, Ayana is still an investor and she has always had multiple ventures centered around inclusion leadership and development, venture capital, and entrepreneurship. Fearless Fund is merely one avenue in her pursuit to be an advocate for the marginalized,\u201d her spokesperson said.\n\nParsons said in her LinkedIn post that she founded the firm \u201cto help change the game for women of color entrepreneurs. And my rationale was simple: women of color are the most founded yet the least funded. They are starting businesses at a faster rate than any other demographic yet lack access to the capital, resources, education and networks needed to scale their businesses.\u201d\n\nShe also promised not to give up on her goal. \u201cI remain steadfast in my support of and commitment to the advancement of women of color,\u201d she said in an emailed statement, mentioning that she\u2019ll soon be publishing a book, too.\n\nStill, as we previously pointed out, the sad fact is that big names in the tech ecosystem have not exactly come out swinging in support. CEO Simone told Inc. earlier this year that the fund had lost nearly all its partnerships aside from two, JPMorgan and Costco. Even Mastercard, who sponsored the now-contested Strivers Grant, has publicly never commented on the lawsuit.\n\nIndeed, support for anything considered DEI has done a complete pendulum swing in tech in 2024, from its height in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd.

{"title": "The RIAA\u2019s lawsuit against generative music startups will be the bloodbath AI needs", "text": "Like many AI companies, music generation startups Udio and Suno appear to have relied on unauthorized scrapes of copyrighted works in order to train their models. This is by their own and investors\u2019 admission, as well as according to new lawsuits filed against them by music companies. If these suits go before a jury, the trial could be both a damaging expos\u00e9 and a highly useful precedent for similarly sticky-fingered AI companies facing certain legal peril.\n\nThe lawsuits, filed by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), put us all in the uncomfortable position of rooting for the RIAA, which for decades has been the bogeyman of digital media. I myself have received nastygrams from them! The case is simply that clear.\n\nThe gist of the two lawsuits, which are extremely similar in content, is that Suno and Udio (strictly speaking, Uncharted Labs doing business as Udio) indiscriminately pillaged more or less the entire history of recorded music to form datasets, which they then used to train a music-generating AI.\n\nAnd here let us quickly note that these AIs don\u2019t \u201cgenerate\u201d so much as match the user\u2019s prompt to patterns from their training data and then attempt to complete that pattern. In a way, all these models do is perform covers or mashups of the songs they ingested.\n\nThat Suno and Udio did ingest said copyrighted data seems, for all intents and purposes (including legal ones), very likely. The companies\u2019 leadership and investors have been unwisely loose-lipped about the copyright challenges of the space.\n\nThey have admitted that the only way to create a good music generation model is to ingest a large amount of high-quality music. It is very simply a necessary step for creating machine learning models of this type.\n\nThen they said that they did so without the permission of music labels. Investor Antonio Rodriguez of Matrix Partners told Rolling Stone just a few months ago:\n\nHonestly, if we had deals with labels when this company got started, I probably wouldn\u2019t have invested in it. I think that they needed to make this product without the constraints.\n\nThe companies told the RIAA\u2019s lawyers that they believe the media it has ingested falls under fair-use doctrine \u2014 which fundamentally only comes into play in the unauthorized use of a work. Now, fair use is admittedly a complex and hazy concept in idea and execution, but the companies\u2019 use does appear to stray somewhat outside the intended safe harbor of, say, a seventh grader using a Pearl Jam song in the background of their video on global warming.\n\nTo be blunt, it looks like these companies\u2019 goose is cooked. They might have hoped that they could take a page from OpenAI\u2019s playbook, using evasive language and misdirection to stall their less deep-pocketed critics, like authors and journalists. (If by the time AI companies\u2019 skulduggery is revealed and they\u2019re the only option for distribution, it no longer matters.)\n\nBut it\u2019s harder to pull off when there\u2019s a smoking gun in your hand. And unfortunately for Udio and Suno, the RIAA says in its lawsuit that it has a few thousand smoking guns and that songs it owns are clearly being regurgitated by the music models. Its claim: that whether Jackson 5 or Maroon 5, the \u201cgenerated\u201d songs are lightly garbled versions of the originals \u2014 something that would be impossible if the original were not included in the training data.\n\nThe nature of LLMs \u2014 specifically, their tendency to hallucinate and lose the plot the more they write \u2014 precludes regurgitation of, for example, entire books. This has likely mooted a lawsuit by authors against OpenAI, since the latter can plausibly claim the snippets its model does quote were grabbed from reviews, first pages available online and so on. (The latest goalpost move is that they did use copyright works early on but have since stopped, which is funny because it\u2019s like saying you only juiced the orange once but have since stopped.)\n\nWhat you can\u2019t do is plausibly claim that your music generator only heard a few bars of \u201cGreat Balls of Fire\u201d and somehow managed to spit out the rest word for word and chord for chord. Any judge or jury would laugh in your face, and with luck a court artist will have their chance at illustrating that.\n\nThis is not only intuitively obvious but legally consequential as well, as the re-creation of entire works (garbled, but quite obviously based on the originals) opens up a new avenue for relief. If the RIAA can convince the judge that Udio and Suno are doing real and major harm to the business of the copyright holders and artists, it can ask the court to shut down the AI companies\u2019 whole operation at the outset of the trial with an injunction.\n\nOpening paragraphs of your book coming out of an LLM? That\u2019s an intellectual issue to be discussed at length. Dollar-store \u201cCall Me Maybe\u201d generated on demand? Shut it down. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right, but it\u2019s likely.\n\nThe predictable response from the companies has been that the system is not intended to replicate copyrighted works: a desperate, naked attempt to offload liability onto users under Section 230 safe harbor. That is, the same way Instagram isn\u2019t liable if you use a copyrighted song to back your Reel. Here, the argument seems unlikely to gain traction, partly because of the aforementioned admissions that the company itself ignored copyright to begin with.\n\nWhat will be the consequence of these lawsuits? As with all things AI, it\u2019s quite impossible to say ahead of time, since there is little in the way of precedent or applicable, settled doctrine.\n\nMy prediction is that the companies will be forced to expose their training data and methods, these things being of clear evidentiary interest. And if this evidence shows that they are indeed misusing copyrighted material, we\u2019ll see an attempt to settle or avoid trial, and/or a speedy judgment against Udio and Suno. It\u2019s likely that at least one of the two will attempt to continue onward, using legal (or at least legal-adjacent) sources of music, but the resulting model would (by their own standards for training data) almost certainly result in a huge step down in quality, and users would flee.\n\nInvestors? Ideally, they\u2019ll lose their shirts, having placed their bets on something that was in all likelihood illegal and certainly unethical, and not just in the eyes of nebbish author associations but according to the legal minds at the infamously and ruthlessly litigious RIAA.\n\nThe consequences may be far-reaching: If investors in a hot new generative media startup suddenly see a hundred million dollars vaporized due to the fundamental nature of generative media, suddenly a different level of diligence will seem appropriate.\n\nCompanies may learn from the trial or settlement documents what can be said \u2014 or perhaps more importantly, what should not be said \u2014 to avoid liability and keep copyright holders guessing.\n\nThough this particular suit seems almost a foregone conclusion, it will not be a playbook to prosecuting or squeezing settlements out of other generative AI companies but an object lesson in hubris.\n\nIt\u2019s good to have one of those every once in a while, even if the teacher happens to be the RIAA.", "authors": "['Devin Coldewey']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-1495170962.jpg?resize=1200,800", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/the-riaas-lawsuit-against-generative-music-startups-will-be-the-bloodbath-ai-needs/", "timestamp": "1719365924.410746", "displayed": 0}

On Tuesday, Meta announced that it\u2019s now opening up its beta for sharing to the fediverse to Threads users who are 18 and up and who are using Threads with a public account in global markets.\n\nThe beta was first introduced in March but was limited to three countries to start, including the U.S., Canada and Japan. In a post on Threads, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared that the option is now available to more than 100 countries worldwide.\n\nWith the beta, Meta is also taking on one of the larger initiatives around making the fediverse more viable: user education. Today, many people don\u2019t understand how the fediverse works or what it means to federate your account across the open social web.

{"title": "Inspired by Gen Z, Pinterest users can now turn boards into videos for sharing on Instagram and TikTok", "text": "Pinterest is reimagining its app for the TikTok era. Catering to Gen Z\u2019s demand for video-focused features, the company on Tuesday announced it will now allow users to create short videos of their curated Pinterest boards, designed to be shared on social media.\n\nThe new addition was inspired by the video-sharing activity that was already taking place on apps like TikTok. In 2022, for example, Pinterest introduced a new collage-making app called Shuffles that quickly took off with Gen Z creators on TikTok. The app, still in invite-only mode at the time, went viral as Pinterest users published their so-called \u201caesthetic\u201d collages and mood boards set to music and posted them on TikTok. Later, Shuffles inspired an official Pinterest feature for shoppable collages.\n\nIn addition, Pinterest users have been sharing their boards on apps like TikTok using more-manual methods, like posting screenshots or using the app\u2019s green screen effects to share their curated collections, styles and individuality. Pinterest dubs this type of sharing the \u201cmecore\u201d trend, noting that it has seen a 565% increase in searches related to this activity on its platform annually. Boards titled \u201cmecore\u201d also increased by 255% since last year, it said.\n\nScreenshot Image Credits: Pinterest\n\nWith board sharing, Pinterest users will be able to share their boards in a more creative way on social media. The shared boards will also feature links that, when clicked, bring viewers back to the complete board on Pinterest where they can browse through or shop the collected content. To date, Pinterest users have created more than 10 billion boards.\n\nThe addition may inspire increased social sharing among Gen Z users, who are already drawn to Pinterest, and could serve as a way to increase traffic back to Pinterest\u2019s app by leveraging the viral mechanics of platforms like TikTok and others.\n\nThe company partnered with power users and recording artists Avril Lavigne and Tierra Whack on the launch to showcase the new functionality, while also helping position the feature as a way for creators to reach their fans in new ways. Lavigne\u2019s board includes fashion inspiration and promotes her tour, while Whack uses Pinterest for her eclectic interests and to gather inspiration for her creative projects.\n\nTo use the feature, just tap the share icon in the top right of any of your public boards to automatically generate a video. You can then click the \u201cAdd to Story\u201d button or \u201cDownload\u201d button to share the video anywhere else, like TikTok. If sharing to Instagram Stories, use the Stickers icon to find the Link sticker and then paste in the board\u2019s URL.\n\nYou can also edit the board\u2019s Pins or choose a different template before sharing, the company said.\n\n\u201cGen Z makes up over 40% of our global monthly users on Pinterest and are our most engaged generation, with a significant increase in the number of boards created by Gen Z Pinners compared to last year,\u201d noted Rachel Hardy, director of consumer product marketing at Pinterest, in a statement about the new addition. \u201cWe are enhancing the board features based on user feedback and, this year, board sharing is one of our critical investments as users value the ability to share their creative processes on different platforms and find inspiration from others.\u201d", "authors": "['Sarah Perez']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Pinterest_Board_Sharing_2024_Newsroom_trio__1_.webp?resize=1200,738", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/inspired-by-gen-z-pinterest-users-can-now-turn-boards-into-videos-for-sharing-on-instagram-and-tiktok/", "timestamp": "1719365961.633843", "displayed": 0}

Pinterest dubs this type of sharing the \u201cmecore\u201d trend, noting that it has seen a 565% increase in searches related to this activity on its platform annually. Boards titled \u201cmecore\u201d also increased by 255% since last year, it said.\n\nScreenshot Image Credits: Pinterest\n\nWith board sharing, Pinterest users will be able to share their boards in a more creative way on social media. The shared boards will also feature links that, when clicked, bring viewers back to the complete board on Pinterest where they can browse through or shop the collected content. To date, Pinterest users have created more than 10 billion boards.\n\nThe addition may inspire increased social sharing among Gen Z users, who are already drawn to Pinterest, and could serve as a way to increase traffic back to Pinterest\u2019s app by leveraging the viral mechanics of platforms like TikTok and others.\n\nThe company partnered with power users and recording artists Avril Lavigne and Tierra Whack on the launch to showcase the new functionality, while also helping position the feature as a way for creators to reach their fans in new ways. Lavigne\u2019s board includes fashion inspiration and promotes her tour, while Whack uses Pinterest for her eclectic interests and to gather inspiration for her creative projects.\n\nTo use the feature, just tap the share icon in the top right of any of your public boards to automatically generate a video. You can then click the \u201cAdd to Story\u201d button or \u201cDownload\u201d button to share the video anywhere else, like TikTok. If sharing to Instagram Stories, use the Stickers icon to find the Link sticker and then paste in the board\u2019s URL.\n\nYou can also edit the board\u2019s Pins or choose a different template before sharing, the company said.\n\n\u201cGen Z makes up over 40% of our global monthly users on Pinterest and are our most engaged generation, with a significant increase in the number of boards created by Gen Z Pinners compared to last year,\u201d noted Rachel Hardy, director of consumer product marketing at Pinterest, in a statement about the new addition. \u201cWe are enhancing the board features based on user feedback and, this year, board sharing is one of our critical investments as users value the ability to share their creative processes on different platforms and find inspiration from others.\u201d", "authors": "['Sarah Perez']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Pinterest_Board_Sharing_2024_Newsroom_trio__1_.webp?resize=1200,738", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/inspired-by-gen-z-pinterest-users-can-now-turn-boards-into-videos-for-sharing-on-instagram-and-tiktok/", "timestamp": "1719365965.7405682", "displayed": 0}

But it won\u2019t reveal how much.\n\nGreycroft, Coatue Management, Sound Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, O\u2019Shaughnessy Ventures and angel investors Prem Akkaraju, ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt, Robert Nelsen and Napster founder and ex-Facebook exec Sean Parker have injected fresh capital into Stability, the company revealed Tuesday morning. Parker has joined Stability AI as executive board chairman, sitting alongside Greycroft managing partner Dana Settle, Coatue Management COO Colin Bryant and Akkaraju \u2014 who\u2019s been appointed Stability\u2019s CEO \u2014 on the company\u2019s board of directors.\n\n\u201cStability AI has made a global impact by creating the leading generative image foundation models and fostering the largest ecosystem of generative AI media creators and developers,\u201d Parker said in a statement. \u201cInnovation happens at the intersection of art and technology: the company\u2019s world-class research and applied AI teams collaborate with a vibrant community of AI artists, model builders and developers who have ingeniously extended the capabilities of the company\u2019s core models.\u201d\n\nThe announcement was preempted by The Information earlier this week, which revealed in a scoop that Stability AI was close to reaching a deal with VCs as it faces a cash crunch and unpaid cloud bills. Both The Information and Reuters reported that the fundraise could result in a lower valuation for the startup; Stability AI declined to comment.\n\nStability rose to prominence in 2022 after the release of Stable Diffusion, an image-generating AI model developed at Ludwig Maximilian University in collaboration with AI startup Runway. Stability delivered updates to the open source model and built services around it, eventually commercializing it and growing Stable Diffusion into one of the most widely used open image-generating models today.\n\nStability\u2019s ambitions grew in the subsequent years, and the startup ventured into a number of domains, including code, text, doodle, music, sound, 3D model and video generation and even biomedical research. But the company\u2019s co-founder and ex-CEO, Emad Mostaque, reportedly mismanaged Stability into financial ruin, leading staff to resign, a partnership with Canva to fall through and investors to grow concerned about Stability\u2019s prospects.\n\nStability had just $4 million in the bank last October, per reports \u2014 a far cry from the over $100 million in capital it raised in the proceeding years from investors including Intel \u2014 and was projected to make just $11 million in sales in 2023. Meanwhile, the company was on the hook for $99 million a year for cloud infrastructure rentals from AWS, Google Cloud and CoreWeave to train and run its models and $53 million in operating expenses and wages.\n\nBy December, Stability had pivoted to a subscription model for commercial use of its technology with prices starting at $20 per month. The company also considered reselling its compute resources as a managed service, according to reporting \u2014 and, at the urging of Lightspeed, selling itself.\n\nMostaque left in March following pressure from investors.\n\nStability\u2019s new investors, including Schmidt, have committed $80 million to effectively take over Stability; struck a deal with the startup\u2019s suppliers to forgive some $100 million in debt; and negotiated for Stability to be released from $300 million in future obligations largely meant to go to cloud infrastructure providers, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear where Stability goes from here. Key talent including several researchers behind the development of Stable Diffusion, as well as Ed Newton-Rex, who was heading up Stability\u2019s generative AI audio efforts, have left.

Parker says that Stability will focus on growing its managed image, video and audio pipelines and workflows, building custom enterprise models and content production tools and delivering APIs to power consumer apps for art, graphic design, social media and gaming.\n\nWherever Stability\u2019s future takes it, Parker pledges that the company will remain \u201ccommitted to open-source principles.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur investment in Stability AI enables the continued development of open-source, open-access and open-weight models for the benefit of the entire community,\u201d he said. \u201cThe market opportunity in generative media \u2014 spanning images, video, 3D, voice and music \u2014 is just getting started \u2026 This investment will enable the creation of even more powerful models and allow the community to continue pushing the boundaries of human creativity.\u201d", "authors": "['Kyle Wiggers']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1258944889.jpg?resize=1200,799", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/stability-ai-lands-a-lifeline-from-sean-parker-greycroft/", "timestamp": "1719365971.835615", "displayed": 0}

With the waitlist numbers now dwindling to a few hundred, Waymo decided to remove it altogether.\n\nWaymo secured another key approval in March from the California Public Utilities Commission to operate a commercial robotaxi service in Los Angeles, the San Francisco Peninsula and on San Francisco freeways. Waymo has not yet expanded its driverless commercial operations to San Francisco freeways or communities in the greater Peninsula, although the company is testing in those areas. Instead, Waymo\u2019s San Francisco fleet of 300 robotaxis is used within the city limits. Waymo has more than 700 robotaxis in its total fleet, which is spread between commercial markets in Phoenix, Los Angeles and San Francisco, as well as testing locations in Silicon Valley and Austin, Texas.\n\nAccording to Waymo\u2019s internal stats, the service has proven popular. The company said Tuesday that it gives tens of thousands of trips each week in San Francisco, a similar number as Phoenix. Waymo said more than half of its San Francisco customers used its robotaxis in the past couple of months to travel to or from medical appointments, according to data from a company survey. About 36% used Waymo to connect to other forms of transit, like BART or Muni.", "authors": "['Kirsten Korosec']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/SF-Fully-Autonomous.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/waymo-opens-up-san-francisco-robotaxi-service-to-everyone/", "timestamp": "1719365993.2428129", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "Apple\u2019s App Store breaches EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act", "text": "A few months after opening a non-compliance case on Apple and the Digital Markets Act (DMA), the European Commission has shared its preliminary findings with Apple. And the bottom line is that the current App Store rules are in breach of the DMA. Confirmed violations of the DMA can lead to fines of up to 10% of global annual turnover.\n\n\u201c\u2018Act different\u2019 should be their new slogan,\u201d the EU\u2019s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, wrote on X. \u201cFor too long, Apple has been squeezing out innovative companies \u2014 denying consumers new opportunities & choices.\u201d\n\nIn this particular case, the European Commission believes third-party developers should be able to inform customers of alternative purchasing possibilities \u2014 free of charge.\n\nFor instance, developers who have released apps on the App Store can\u2019t advertise different prices or alternative distribution channels in their apps. While Apple now allows developers to include a link to their site, the European Commission believes there are too many restrictions with this link-out mechanism.\n\nEven if developers redirect users to their websites and handle transactions on their websites, they have to report transactions to Apple and pay a commission. Apple only waives a 3% payment processing fee for web purchases.\n\n\u201cApple has made a number of changes to comply with the DMA in response to feedback from developers and the European Commission,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe are confident our plan complies with the law, and estimate more than 99% of developers would pay the same or less in fees to Apple under the new business terms we created.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these preliminary findings, the European Commission is opening a third non-compliance investigation into Apple\u2019s new contractual terms for EU developers. This time, the Commission is going to focus on Apple\u2019s controversial Core Technology Fee (CTF) and alternative app marketplaces.\n\nEuropean developers can remain on the standard business terms or choose new business terms that allow them to distribute their apps outside of the App Store. However, these new terms lead to a \u20ac0.50 fee per installed app after one million downloads.\n\nThe company has already adjusted the CTF so that it doesn\u2019t apply to free non-commercial apps. There\u2019s also a three-year transition period for small developers that release a hit app and get more than one million downloads for the first time. But that doesn\u2019t change much in the long term. With this new formal investigation, the EC will determine whether the CTF effectively complies with the DMA.\n\nIf you\u2019ve tried to install a third-party app store in the EU, such as the AltStore, Setapp Mobile or Aptoide, you may have noticed that it requires quite a few taps. You first get an error in your web browser. You have to open the Settings app, accept app installations from this site, go back to your web browser, download the alternative store again, and accept popups about the risks involved with a third-party app store. The EC will examine this \u201cmulti-step user journey\u201d and its compliance with the DMA rules.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that Apple designed its new business model to discourage app developers and end users from taking advantage of the opportunities afforded to them by the DMA,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, the Commission EVP in charge of competition policy, said in a speech.\n\n\u201cThe letter of the DMA is clear: Gatekeepers have to allow for alternative app stores to establish themselves on their platform, and for consumers to be fully informed about the offers available to them so that they can freely choose where they want to source their apps, and at what conditions,\u201d she added.\n\nAs for today\u2019s preliminary findings, Apple can now respond to the European Commission in writing. The final decision is due one year after the opening of the formal investigation, which means that Apple can negotiate with the EU and adjust its business terms once again to avoid a hefty fine.", "authors": "['Romain Dillet']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2112138706.jpg?resize=1200,795", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/24/apples-app-store-breaches-eus-digital-markets-act/", "timestamp": "1719366006.3463612", "displayed": 0}
{"title": "Silicon Valley leaders are once again declaring \u2018DEI\u2019 bad and \u2018meritocracy\u2019 good \u2014 but they\u2019re wrong", "text": "No, Silicon Valley, a \u2018meritocracy\u2019 is not better than DEI, according to the data\n\nWho\u2019s afraid of the Big Bad DEI? The acronym is near-poisonous now \u2014 a word that creates almost instant tension between those who embrace it and those who want it dead.\n\nA prime example of this divide was the response to startup Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang\u2019s post on X last week. He wrote about moving away from DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) to instead embrace \u201cMEI\u201d \u2014 merit, excellence, and intelligence.\n\n\u201cScale is a meritocracy, and we must always remain one,\u201d Wang wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal whenever we invite someone to join our mission, and those decisions have never been swayed by orthodoxy or virtue signaling or whatever the current thing is.\u201d\n\nToday we\u2019ve formalized an important hiring policy at Scale. We hire for MEI: merit, excellence, and intelligence.\n\n\n\nThis is the email I\u2019ve shared with our @scale_AI team.\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\nMERITOCRACY AT SCALE\n\n\n\nIn the wake of our fundraise, I\u2019ve been getting a lot of questions\u2026 \u2014 Alexandr Wang (@alexandr_wang) June 13, 2024\n\nThe commenters on X \u2014 which included Elon Musk, Palmer Luckey, and Brian Armstrong \u2014 were thrilled. On LinkedIn, however, the startup community gave a less-than-enthusiastic response. Those commenters pointed out that Wang\u2019s post made it seem as if \u201cmeritocracy\u201d was the definitive benchmark to find qualified hiring candidates \u2014 without taking into consideration that the idea of meritocracy is itself subjective. In the days that have followed the post, more and more people have shared their thoughts and what Wang\u2019s comments reveal about the current state of DEI in tech.\n\n\u201cThe post is misguided because people who support the meritocracy argument are ignoring the structural reasons some groups are more likely to outperform others,\u201d Mutale Nkonde, a founder working in AI policy, told TechCrunch. \u201dWe all want the best people for the job, and there is data to prove that diverse teams are more effective.\u201d\n\nEmily Witko, an HR professional at AI startup Hugging Face, told TechCrunch that the post was a \u201cdangerous oversimplification,\u201d but that it received so much attention on X because it \u201copenly expressed sentiments that are not always expressed publicly and the audience there is hungry to attack DEI.\u201d Wang\u2019s MEI thought \u201cmakes it so easy to refute or criticize any conversations regarding the importance of acknowledging underrepresentation in tech,\u201d she continued.\n\nBut Wang is far from the only Silicon Valley insider to attack DEI in recent months. He joins a chorus of those who feel that DEI programs implemented at businesses over the past several years, peaking with the Black Lives Matter movement, caused a backslide in corporate profitability \u2014 and that a return to \u201cmeritocratic principles\u201d is overdue. Indeed, much of the tech industry has worked to dismantle recruitment programs that considered candidates who, under previous hiring regimes, were often overlooked in the hiring process.\n\nSeeking to make a change, in 2020, many organizations and power players came together to promise more of a focus on DEI, which, contrary to the mainstream discussion, is not simply about hiring someone based on the color of their skin but is about ensuring qualified people from all walks of life \u2014 regardless of skin, gender, or ethnic background \u2014 are better represented and included in recruitment funnels. It\u2019s also about taking a look at disparities and pipeline issues, analyzing the reasoning behind why certain candidates are constantly overlooked in a hiring process.\n\nIn 2023, the U.S. data industry saw new women recruit levels drop by two-thirds, from 36% in 2022 to just 12%, according to a report from HR staffing firm Harnham. Meanwhile, the percentage of Black, Indigenous, and professionals of color in VP or above data roles stood at just 38% in 2022.\n\nAlexandr Wang (pictured above) caused a stir on social media when he posted about meritocracy in tech on X. Image Credits: Drew Angerer / Staff / Getty Images\n\nDEI-related job listings have also fallen out of favor, declining 44% in 2023, according to data from the job site Indeed. In the AI industry, a recent Deloitte survey of women found that over half said they ended up leaving at least one employer because of how men and women were treated differently, while 73% considered leaving the tech industry altogether due to unequal pay and an inability to advance in their careers.\n\nYet, for an industry that prides itself on being data-driven, Silicon Valley cannot let the idea of a meritocracy go \u2014 despite all the data and research showing how such thinking is just a belief system and one that can lead to biased outcomes. The idea of going out and hiring \u201cthe best person for the job\u201d without taking into account any human sociology is how pattern-matching occurs \u2014 teams and companies of people who are alike, when the research has long shown that more diverse teams perform better. Moreover, it has only raised suspicions about who the Valley considers excellent and why.\n\nExperts we spoke to said this subjectiveness revealed other issues with Wang\u2019s missive \u2014 mostly that he presents MEI as a revolutionary idea and not one that Silicon Valley and most of corporate America have long embraced. The acronym \u201cMEI\u201d appears to be a scornful nod to DEI, intended to drive home the notion that a company must choose between hiring diverse candidates or candidates that meet certain \u201cobjective\u201d qualifications.\n\nNatalie Sue Johnson, co-founder of the DEI consulting firm Paradigm, told TechCrunch that research has shown meritocracy to be a paradox and that organizations that focus too much on it actually see an increase in bias. \u201cIt frees people up from thinking that they have to try hard to be fair in their decision-making,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey think that meritocracy is inherent, not something that needs to be achieved.\u201d\n\nAs Nkonde mentioned, Johnson noted that Wang\u2019s approach doesn\u2019t acknowledge that underrepresented groups face systemic barriers society is still struggling to address. Ironically, the most meritorious person could be the one who has achieved a skill set for a job despite such barriers that may have influenced their educational background or prevented them from filling their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with the kind of college internships that impresses Silicon Valley.\n\nTreating a person as a faceless, nameless candidate, without understanding their unique experiences, and therefore their employability, is a mistake, Johnson said. \u201cThere is nuance.\u201d\n\nWitko added to that: \u201cA meritocratic system is built on criteria that reflect the status quo, and therefore, it will perpetuate existing inequalities by continuously favoring those who already have advantages.\u201d\n\nTo be somewhat charitable to Wang, given how acidic the term DEI has become, developing a new term that still represents the value of fairness to all candidates, isn\u2019t a terrible idea \u2014 even if \u201cmeritocracy\u201d is misguided. And his post suggests that Scale AI\u2019s values could align with the spirit of diversity, equity, and inclusion even if he might not realize it, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cCasting a wide net for talent and making objective hiring decisions that do not disadvantage candidates based on identity is exactly what diversity, equity, and inclusion work seeks to do,\u201d she explained.\n\nBut again, where Wang undermines this is endorsing the mistaken belief that meritocracy will produce outcomes based on one\u2019s abilities and merits alone.\n\nPerhaps it is all a paradox. If one looks at Scale AI\u2019s treatment of its data annotators \u2014 many of whom live in economically depressed countries and scrape by on little pay \u2014 it suggests the company has scant real interest in disrupting the status quo.\n\nScale AI\u2019s annotators work on tasks for multiple eight-hour workdays \u2014 no breaks \u2014 for pay ranging as low as $10 (per the Verge and NY Mag). It\u2019s on the backs of these annotators that Scale AI has built a business worth over $13 billion and with more than $1.6 billion in cash in the bank.\n\nWhen asked for comment on the allegations made in the Verge and NY Mag piece, a spokesperson pointed to this blog post, in which it described its human annotator jobs as \u201cgig work.\u201d The spokesperson didn\u2019t address TechCrunch\u2019s request for clarification on Scale AI\u2019s MEI policy.\n\nJohnson said Wang\u2019s post is a great example of the box many leaders and companies find themselves trapped in.\n\nShe pondered, can they trust that having meritocratic ideals is enough to lead to truly meritocratic outcomes, and promote diversity?\n\n\u201cOr,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cdo they acknowledge that ideals are not enough, and to truly build more diverse workforces where everyone has the same access to opportunities and can do their best work requires intention?\u201d", "authors": "['Dominic-Madori Davis', 'Kyle Wiggers']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DEI-big-bad-wolf.jpg?resize=1200,645", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/23/silicon-valley-leaders-are-once-again-declaring-dei-bad-and-meritocracy-good-but-theyre-wrong/", "timestamp": "1719366007.778702", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "iOS 18 could \u2018sherlock\u2019 $400M in app revenue", "text": "Apple\u2019s practice of leveraging ideas from its third-party developer community to become new iOS and Mac features and apps has a hefty price tag, a new report indicates. With the release of iOS 18 later this fall, Apple\u2019s changes may affect apps that today have an estimated $393 million in revenue and have been downloaded roughly 58 million times over the past year, according to an analysis by app intelligence firm Appfigures.\n\nEvery June at Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference, the iPhone maker teases the upcoming releases of its software and operating systems, which often include features previously only available through third-party apps. The practice is so common now it\u2019s even been given a name: \u201csherlocking\u201d \u2014 a reference to a 1990s search app for Mac that borrowed features from a third-party app known as Watson. Now when Apple launches a new feature that was before the domain of a third-party app, it\u2019s said to have \u201csherlocked\u201d the app.\n\nIn earlier years, sherlocking apps made some sense. After all, did the iPhone\u2019s flashlight really need to be a third-party offering, or would it be better as a built-in function? Plus, Apple has been able to launch features that made its software better adapted to consumers\u2019 wants and needs by looking at what\u2019s popular among the third-party developer community.\n\nOf course, this practice also raises the question as to whether Apple is leveraging proprietary data to make its determinations about what to build next, and whether the apps it competes with are being offered an even playing field. For example, before Apple launched its own parental controls system, it shut down many third-party apps that had built businesses in this space by saying their solutions were now noncompliant with its rules and policies. The apps weren\u2019t offered access to a developer API for managing Apple\u2019s built-in parental controls for years, prompting an antitrust investigation.\n\nIn more recent years, Apple has \u201csherlocked\u201d third parties with launches of features like Continuity Camera, medication tracking, sleep tracking and mood tracking, as well as apps like Freeform and Journal. This year, it turned its attention to password managers, call recording and transcription apps, those for making custom emoji, AI-powered writing tools and math helpers, trail apps and more.\n\nIn an analysis of third-party apps that generated more than 1,000 downloads per year, Appfigures discovered several genres that had found themselves in Apple\u2019s crosshairs in 2024.\n\nIn terms of worldwide gross revenue, these categories have generated significant income over the past 12 months, with the trail app category making the most at $307 million per year, led by market leader and 2023 Apple \u201cApp of the Year\u201d AllTrails. Grammar helper apps, like Grammarly and others, also generated $35.7 million, while math helpers and password managers earned $23.4 million and $20.3 million, respectively. Apps for making custom emoji generated $7 million, too.\n\nImage Credits: Appfigures\n\nOf these, trail apps accounted for the vast majority of \u201cpotentially sherlocked\u201d revenue, or 78%, noted Appfigures, as well as 40% of downloads of sherlocked apps. In May 2024, they accounted for an estimated $28.8 million in gross consumer spending and 2.5 million downloads, to give you an idea of scale.\n\nMany of these app categories were growing quickly, with math solvers having seen revenue growth of 43% year-over-year followed by grammar helpers (+40%), password managers (+38%) and trail apps (+28%). Emoji-making apps, however, were seeing declines at -17% year-over-year.\n\nImage Credits: Appfigures\n\nBy downloads, grammar helpers had seen 9.4 million installs over the past 12 months, followed by emoji makers (10.6 million), math-solving apps (9.5 million) and password managers (457,000 installs).\n\nAlthough these apps certainly have dedicated user bases that may not immediately choose to switch to a first-party offering, Apple\u2019s ability to offer similar functionality built-in could be detrimental to their potential growth. Casual users may be satisfied by Apple\u2019s \u201cgood enough\u201d solutions and won\u2019t seek out alternatives.\n\nHowever, apps that continue to develop new features and add enhancements beyond what Apple includes while also taking advantage of other new ways to reach users, like through Apple\u2019s improved Siri, may have a better shot than others.", "authors": "['Sarah Perez']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/app-store-2024-v1.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/18/ios-18-could-sherlock-400m-in-app-revenue/", "timestamp": "1719366010.68223", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "ChatGPT: Everything you need to know about the AI chatbot", "text": "ChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to hyper-charge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth used by more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies.\n\nThat growth has propelled OpenAI itself into becoming one of the most-hyped companies in recent memory. And its latest partnership with Apple for its upcoming generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, has given the company another significant bump in the AI race.\n\n2024 also saw the release of GPT-4o, OpenAI\u2019s new flagship omni model for ChatGPT.

This version of ChatGPT will have \u201cslightly more restrictive content policies,\u201d according to OpenAI. When TechCrunch asked for more details, however, the response was unclear:\n\n\u201cThe signed out experience will benefit from the existing safety mitigations that are already built into the model, such as refusing to generate harmful content. In addition to these existing mitigations, we are also implementing additional safeguards specifically designed to address other forms of content that may be inappropriate for a signed out experience,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\nMarch 2024\n\nOpenAI\u2019s chatbot store is filling up with spam\n\nTechCrunch found that the OpenAI\u2019s GPT Store is flooded with bizarre, potentially copyright-infringing GPTs.

While OpenAI lets artists \u201copt out\u201d of and remove their work from the datasets that the company uses to train its image-generating models, some artists have described the tool as onerous.\n\nA new report estimates that ChatGPT uses more than half a million kilowatt-hours of electricity per day\n\nChatGPT\u2019s environmental impact appears to be massive.

How does it work?\n\nChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.\n\nWhen did ChatGPT get released?\n\nNovember 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.\n\nWhat is the latest version of ChatGPT?\n\nBoth the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.\n\nCan I use ChatGPT for free?\n\nThere is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.\n\nWho uses ChatGPT?\n\nAnyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.\n\nWhat companies use ChatGPT?\n\nMultiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.\n\nMost recently, Microsoft announced at it\u2019s 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.\n\nWhat does GPT mean in ChatGPT?\n\nGPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.\n\nWhat is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?\n\nA chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they\u2019ll give canned responses to questions.\n\nChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.\n\nCan ChatGPT write essays?\n\nYes.\n\nCan ChatGPT commit libel?\n\nDue to the nature of how these models work, they don\u2019t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That\u2019s a problem when you\u2019re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn\u2019t commit, that may well at this point be libel.\n\nWe will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.\n\nDoes ChatGPT have an app?\n\nYes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.\n\nWhat is the ChatGPT character limit?\n\nIt\u2019s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.\n\nDoes ChatGPT have an API?\n\nYes, it was released March 1, 2023.\n\nWhat are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?\n\nEveryday examples include programing, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.\n\nWhat are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?\n\nAdvanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.\n\nHow good is ChatGPT at writing code?\n\nIt depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can\u2019t necessarily program an entire app\u2019s worth of code. That\u2019s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness \u2014 in other words, the generated code isn\u2019t always appropriate for the specific context in which it\u2019s being used.\n\nCan you save a ChatGPT chat?\n\nYes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.\n\nAre there alternatives to ChatGPT?\n\nYes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google\u2019s Gemini and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.\n\nHow does ChatGPT handle data privacy?\n\nOpenAI has said that individuals in \u201ccertain jurisdictions\u201d (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression \u201cin accordance with applicable laws\u201d.\n\nThe web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled \u201cOpenAI Personal Data Removal Request\u201d.\n\nIn its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on \u201clegitimate interest\u201d (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out \u2014 when it writes: \u201cSee here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.\u201d\n\nWhat controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?\n\nRecently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI\u2019s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.\n\nAn Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT\u2019s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.\n\nCNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.\n\nSeveral major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.\n\nThere have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.\n\nWhere can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?\n\nSeveral marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.\n\nCan ChatGPT be detected?\n\nPoorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they\u2019re inconsistent at best.\n\nAre ChatGPT chats public?\n\nNo. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users\u2019 conversations to other people on the service.\n\nWhat lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?\n\nNone specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.\n\nAre there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?\n\nYes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.", "authors": "['Kyle Wiggers', 'Cody Corrall', 'Alyssa Stringer']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1462188043.jpg?resize=1200,798", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/17/chatgpt-everything-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot/", "timestamp": "1719366016.093642", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "The 29 Best Shows on Apple TV+ Right Now", "text": "Slowly but surely, Apple TV+ is finding its feet. The streaming service, which at launch we called \u201codd, angsty, and horny as hell,\u201d has evolved into a diverse library of dramas, documentaries, and comedies. Now, its library is so packed, we\u2019ve declared it \u201cthe new HBO.\u201d\n\nCurious but don\u2019t know where to get started? Below are our picks for the best shows on the service. (Also, here are our picks for the best movies on Apple TV+.) When you\u2019re done, head over to our guides to the best shows on Netflix, best movies on Hulu, and best movies on Amazon Prime, because you can never have too much television.\n\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more.\n\nPresumed Innocent\n\nJust to be clear, this whodunit has been done before. Thirty-four years ago, Harrison Ford starred in the film adaptation of Scott Turow\u2019s novel. This time around, the lead is played by Jake Gyllenhaal, and the adaptation is an eight-part limited series, not a film. Gyllenhaal stars as Rusty Sabich, a Chicago prosecutor accused of killing a colleague. A colleague with whom he was having an affair. The series is produced by David E. Kelley, so it has the intrigue and glossiness of his recent offerings like Big Little Lies and The Undoing, as well as the darkness and drama.\n\nSunny\n\nSunny comes at an interesting time. It\u2019s the story of a woman named Suzie (Rashida Jones) whose husband and son are lost in a mysterious plane crash. To work through her grief, Suzie is given Sunny, a domestic robot with whom she forms a unique bond as she begins to uncover what happened to her family. As artificial intelligence gets more and more ingrained in everyone\u2019s lives, Sunny promises to hit differently than it would at any other time. The first two episodes drop on July 10, with the remaining eight rolling out every Wednesday through September.\n\nSTEVE! (martin) A Documentary in 2 Pieces\n\nPutting this on the \u201cbest shows on Apple TV+\u201d list is a bit of a cheat. Rather than a series, this two-part documentary is more like a pair of movies looking at the life and career of Steve Martin. The first part chronicles his rise in, and reimagining of, the standup comedy world. The second looks at how he went from that to the neurotic and lovable neighbor he currently plays on Only Murders in the Building, which would be his career\u2019s triumphant second act if he hadn\u2019t had something like 30 acts in between. Directed by Morgan Neville, who made the backup singer documentary 20 Feet From Stardom and the Fred Rogers doc Won\u2019t You Be My Neighbor?, it\u2019s funny, intimate, and a little surprising\u2014just like Martin himself.\n\nLoot\n\nOK, so Loot isn't exactly about MacKenzie Scott's divorce from Jeff Bezos, but it is about a woman named Molly (Maya Rudolph) who separates from her tech billionaire husband and devotes herself to philanthropic work. Also, creators Alan Yang (Master of None) and Matt Hubbard (Superstore) were kind of inspired by Bezos and Scott's split. With an incredible supporting cast that includes Joel Kim Booster, Michaela Ja\u00e9 Rodriguez, and Adam Scott, it's a quirky comedy with a lot of heart\u2014and the kind of thing you (probably) won't see on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nThe Big Door Prize\n\nWith The Big Door Prize Chris O'Dowd finally got the \u201cguy leading a show\u201d role he was always meant for. In the series, he plays a 40-year-old high school teacher named Dusty who's pretty content with his life until a magic machine shows up in his small town. The machine, you see, tells people their life's potential, and as soon as people around him start using it, everything changes. Marriages end, paths divert, and eventually Dusty must confront whether he's happy in his own life. Season 2 of the series, which launched in spring 2024, explores what happens after everyone upends their lives.\n\nThe Completely Made-Up Adventures of Dick Turpin\n\nDick Turpin was a real highwayman in 18th-century England who was ultimately executed for horse theft. But the myths surrounding him are far more interesting than the facts. The Completely Made-Up Adventures of Dick Turpin, true to its name, opts to stick with the fun stuff. Starring Noel Fielding (The Great British Bake Off) in the title role, this six-episode series presents Turpin as someone who stumbled into leading a group of outlaws and made the best of it. Enjoy the ride.\n\nConstellation\n\nAround here we have a theory that Apple TV+ is the new HBO. At the same time, we also wonder among ourselves whether it\u2019s the new Syfy. After opening with a bang in 2019 with For All Mankind, it has released a steady drumbeat of trippy, spacey, timey-wimey prestige shows, from Foundation to Severance. In early 2024, it released Constellation, an eight-part thriller about an astronaut (Noomi Rapace) who returns to Earth after a disaster in space to find things are very off. Brain-bending and tense, it\u2019s the kind of sci-fi that sucks you in. Get lost.\n\nMasters of the Air\n\nGenerally speaking, \u201cWorld War II drama\u201d and Steven Spielberg is probably enough to get anyone to click Play on this series, but it\u2019s got a lot more than just a good elevator pitch. Based on Donald L. Miller\u2019s Masters of the Air, this series dives deep into the lives of the 100th Bomb Group\u2014aka the \u201cBloody Hundredth\u201d\u2014a group of pilots tasked with risking their lives to fight Nazi Germany from the air. Spielberg and Tom Hanks serve as executive producers, and the cast features Elvis himself, Austin Butler, as well as Saltburn\u2019s Barry Keoghan and Doctor Who\u2019s new Doctor, Ncuti Gatwa.\n\nThe New Look\n\nKeeping with the World War II theme, The New Look follows Christian Dior, Coco Chanel, Pierre Balmain, and Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga as they lay the path for modern fashion in Nazi-occupied Paris. The cast features Ben Mendelsohn as Christian Dior, Juliette Binoche as Coco Chanel, and Maisie Williams as Catherine Dior, and also has a soundtrack courtesy of Jack Antonoff that\u2019s chock full of early 20th-century music covered by the likes of Perfume Genius and Florence Welch.\n\nCriminal Record\n\nApple TV+\u2019s dramas are on a hot streak lately. Now that stellar series like For All Mankind and Slow Horses are finally getting audiences, the streamer is putting more in their queues with Criminal Record. Starring former Doctor Who Doctor Peter Capaldi, the crime drama follows two cops\u2014Capaldi\u2019s Daniel Hegarty and Cush Jumbo\u2019s June Lenker\u2014as they try to get to the bottom of a long-settled case. Daniel worked the case originally and got a confession; June got a fresh tip and wants him to reopen it and find out whether the man who went away for murder is actually innocent. Might sound a bit overdone, but the series also works in elements of law enforcement shortcomings and race in a rapidly-changing Britain for a series that\u2019s about more than just one case.\n\nHijack\n\nThere\u2019s this face Idris Elba does. He\u2019s been perfecting it since he was Stringer Bell on The Wire. It\u2019s the look of total calm even when he\u2019s talking about the most harrowing thing you can imagine. That face gets a full workout in Hijack, in which Elba plays a corporate negotiator who finds himself trying to settle things with a group of, yes, hijackers who have taken over the flight he\u2019s boarded to get home to his family. This series is seven episodes, roughly seven hours\u2014the same length of the flight, and it follows the drama in the air and the political maneuvering below before attempting to stick the landing. Do stay around until the end.\n\nFor All Mankind\n\nLong before Foundation, there was For All Mankind. The show not only set the tone for the kind of glossy prestige sci-fi Apple TV+ had ambitions to make, but it was also the streaming service's attempt to plant its flag in the realm of streaming giants. A solid slice of alternate history, the show starts with a very smart premise: What if the US had been edged out in putting a man on the moon? How would the space-race rivalry between the Americans and the Soviets have played out? It's mostly a slick, stylish, NASA-heavy period drama, but as this is from the brain of Ronald D. Moore, there are a few standout moments and episodes with attention shared around the large ensemble cast. It might be the best sci-fi show you're not watching, and if that's true you now have multiple seasons to catch up on.\n\nMessi Meets America\n\nIf your home screen hasn't made it obvious, Apple TV+ is super stoked about soccer these days. Messi Meets America is a six-part docuseries about all-star player Lionel Messi's move to Major League Soccer's Inter Miami club. The first three episodes aired on October 11, 2023, and subsequent episodes aired in conjunction with last year's MLS season. Messi Mania, indeed.\n\nLessons in Chemistry\n\nBased on the debut novel from science writer Bonnie Garmus, Lessons in Chemistry is the story of Elizabeth Zott (Brie Larson), who gets hired to host a cooking show after she's fired from the lab she was working in for doing science while female. Obviously, the show Elizabeth puts on ends up being about a lot more than just having dinner on the table at 6 pm, but we suggest you watch to find out just how revolutionary it is.\n\nThe Morning Show\n\nEvery streaming service needs a flashy mainstream drama with Hollywood heavyweights to pull in viewers. Apple TV+ has The Morning Show. When Alex Levy (Jennifer Aniston) loses her morning news program cohost Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell) following sexual misconduct accusations, she gets paired up with Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon). What unfolds is a #MeToo-era drama full of TV network intrigue and Sorkin-lite dialog. In its second season, it went deep on Covid-19, and in the third season the series' fictional network, UBA, finds itself dealing with the aftermath of a cyberattack. There's likely a new season coming in 2025, so now's a good time to catch up, or go back and refresh your memory.\n\nShining Girls\n\nThis Elisabeth Moss psychological thriller/murder mystery came out in 2022 and never really got the buzz it likely deserved. All of that to say, you should probably watch it if you haven't already. Moss plays Kirby, a woman who believes a recent Chicago murder may be linked to an attack on her many years prior. She teams with a Sun-Times reporter to investigate, but the deeper she digs the more her own reality starts to shift. Based on the book The Shining Girls by Lauren Beukes, this series may seem like just another murder mystery, but its sci-fi twists put it one step ahead.\n\nFoundation\n\nWIRED called Foundation a \u201cflawed masterpiece\u201d in our review of the first season. Considering the complexities of adapting a sprawling Isaac Asimov book series, it was high praise. Starring Jared Harris as Hari Seldon, a math professor who, along with his loyal followers, is exiled for predicting the oncoming end of the galactic empire that rules over them, the show often suffers under the weight of its own massive scope. But it also features wonderful performances from Lee Pace and beautiful images inspired by the James Webb Space Telescope. If you have a soft spot for big sci-fi dramas, this Game-of-Thrones-in-space wannabe is a must-watch.\n\nThe Crowded Room\n\nSet in the late 1970s, The Crowded Room stars Tom Holland as Danny Sullivan, a young man arrested after a grisly shooting in New York City. Following his arrest, this 10-episode limited series unfolds into a twisty whodunit as interrogator Rya Goodwin (Amanda Seyfried) tries to suss out what happened with the shooting and the peculiar events in Sullivan\u2019s past that may have shaped how he ended up involved. Holland told Extra that the shoot for The Crowded Room, which he also produced, \u201cbroke\u201d him, leading to him taking a yearlong hiatus from acting. Want to see why? Watch now.\n\nSilo\n\nAs WIRED's Kate Knibbs noted in the wake of Silo's release, this show is prestige sci-fi gold. Based on a dystopian book trilogy by Hugh Howey, the series focuses on a subterranean bunker\u2014the silo of the title\u2014where humanity has sequestered itself after the apocalypse. Some are hoping to win the chance to reproduce, some are trying to solve mysterious murders. Everyone watching is enjoying figuring out what's going on in this underground city\u2014and what's happening outside of it.\n\nTed Lasso\n\nOn paper, Ted Lasso sounds terrible. The inconceivable story of an American football coach who has never watched a game of soccer somehow landing himself a job as coach of a (fictional) Premier League club and trying to make up for his total lack of qualifications by being a nice guy. Sounds unwatchable, doesn\u2019t it? And yet Ted Lasso has captured the hearts and minds of viewers on both sides of the pond with its large-as-life cast and irresistibly wholesome messaging, hoovering up awards in the process. The third and final season his the streamer last year, so now is the perfect time to binge it all.\n\nHigh Desert\n\nThe Patricia Arquette\u2013aissance doesn\u2019t get as much ink as Matthew McConaughey or Keanu Reeves did during their second comings, but it\u2019s here\u2014in part thanks to the rise of streaming. Between The Act and Severance, Arquette has received some of the highest accolades of her long career recently, and High Desert is no exception. While coming to terms with the death of her mother, Peggy (Arquette)\u2014an addict\u2014decides she wants to pick up the pieces of her life and become a private investigator. She finds an unwitting employer/sometime mentor in Bruce Harvey (Brad Garrett), but not everyone is onboard with Peggy\u2019s career decisions\u2014namely, her straitlaced sister (Christine Taylor). It\u2019s an odd duck of a show, which is perfectly suited to Arquette\u2019s ethereal acting style, allowing her to seamlessly flit between moments of tragedy and laugh-out-loud comedy, with the audiences doing their best to keep up. The all-star cast is made even more impressive by recurring appearances from Bernadette Peters as Peggy\u2019s late mom.\n\nBig Beasts\n\nLook, Discovery doesn't get to corner the market on animal documentaries\u2014and this 10-part docuseries proves it. Featuring elephant seals, brown bears, orangutans, giant otters, and all kinds of massive mammals in between, it's the perfect thing if you just want to escape and learn a few tidbits about nature. But the best part? It's narrated by Tom Hiddleston, and there's just something charming about hearing the voice of Loki talk about a bunch of different animals he could turn himself into in the blink of an eye.\n\nShrinking\n\nDo you enjoy In Treatment but wish it was, you know, fun? Then Shrinking may be right for you. Created by Bill Lawrence and Brett Goldstein\u2014of Ted Lasso fame\u2014and Jason Segel, the show is about Jimmy (Segel), a therapist struggling to get over the death of his wife and reconnect with his daughter and patients. That may sound like a downer, and the show isn\u2019t without its harder moments, but it\u2019s buoyed by the fact that it\u2019s also a workplace comedy focusing on the therapy practice where Jimmy works alongside Harrison Ford\u2019s Paul and Jessica Williams\u2019 Gaby. Shrinking, ultimately, is about the things people do to cope, but it also features a dream team of a cast and one very memorable party scene featuring an (unrelated) vomit-soaked piano and a super-stoned Ford.\n\nServant\n\nCinematically, M. Night Shyamalan can be a little hit-or-miss, but Servant, which the filmmaker executive produces and occasionally directs, is stellar. It's about a Philadelphia couple\u2014a chef and a news anchor\u2014who lose a child only to have it mysteriously come back to life (maybe) with the arrival of their new nanny. (You really just need to watch the show for any of this to make sense.) Moody, freaky, and occasionally even funny, it'll suck you in. And now that it wrapped its fourth and final season, there\u2019s plenty to enjoy.\n\nThe Essex Serpent\n\nClaire Danes doing her best trembling-chin acting in period garb, Tom Hiddleston as a town vicar, rumors about a mysterious mythological serpent\u2014is there anything not to love about this show? No, there\u2019s not. The Essex Serpent, based on the novel by Sarah Perry, follows a recent widow (Danes) as she heads to the countryside in Essex to investigate a \u201csea dragon.\u201d There, she meets a vicar, Will (Hiddleston), who is far more skeptical of the serpent\u2019s existence. Lush and inviting, it\u2019s the ideal period mystery.\n\nSeverance\n\nOut of all the shows on this list, Severance may be the one that firmly established Apple TV+ as a streaming player with edgy prestige content. Adam Scott plays Mark, a man distraught by the death of his wife who opts to undergo Severance, a procedure that divides his memories of work from those of his life at home. He\u2019s quite happy with the setup until a former Lumon Industries coworker tracks him down when he\u2019s out-of-office, setting off a series of events that makes him question not only Severance but the work his company does. From there, it only gets more weird and bleak with each passing minute. Tense and heartbreaking, this show, the bulk of which was directed by Ben Stiller, will keep you guessing and questioning the whole way through.\n\nLittle America\n\nOriginally released when Donald Trump was still president of the United States, Little America was and remains a timely reminder of what actually makes America great. Each episode of this anthology series focuses on a different story of immigrants living in America. From an undocumented high school student who discovers a talent for squash to a \u201cbra whisperer\u201d in Brooklyn, every one of these 30-minute vignettes\u2014all of them based on real people\u2014is inspiring and important viewing.\n\nMythic Quest\n\nAn all-too-rare example of a video game TV show that really works, Mythic Quest is one of the best new workplace comedies of the past few years. Presented in perfectly bingeable half-hour episodes, the show follows a fictional game studio known for its World of Warcraft\u2013like MMO, Mythic Quest, as the people who make it slalom through their many quirky relationships. The writing is excellent, consistently funny and emotionally impactful when you least expect it, and the show manages to confront real issues in the industry without sacrificing laughs.\n\nDickinson\n\nHailee Steinfeld is a riotous young Emily Dickinson in this half-hour show from creator Alena Smith. It was part of the original Apple TV+ lineup and quickly distinguished itself thanks to its off-kilter vision of 19th-century Amherst, Massachusetts. The first season is a set of sharp, surreal vignettes, inspired by Dickinson's work and tracing the imagined life of the young poet, who is rebelling against her father, the town's societal rules, and just about everything else. The second and third seasons go deeper, examining not only the poet's life, but also the roles that race, gender, sexuality, and class played in the early days of America. If you're a Dickinson stan, love a bit of smart queer dramedy, or just have a penchant for a modern soundtrack in a Civil War\u2013era show, you\u2019ll dig this.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast', 'Angela Watercutter', 'Wired Staff', 'Eric Ravenscraft', 'Jennifer M.

Get lost.\n\nMasters of the Air\n\nGenerally speaking, \u201cWorld War II drama\u201d and Steven Spielberg is probably enough to get anyone to click Play on this series, but it\u2019s got a lot more than just a good elevator pitch. Based on Donald L. Miller\u2019s Masters of the Air, this series dives deep into the lives of the 100th Bomb Group\u2014aka the \u201cBloody Hundredth\u201d\u2014a group of pilots tasked with risking their lives to fight Nazi Germany from the air. Spielberg and Tom Hanks serve as executive producers, and the cast features Elvis himself, Austin Butler, as well as Saltburn\u2019s Barry Keoghan and Doctor Who\u2019s new Doctor, Ncuti Gatwa.\n\nThe New Look\n\nKeeping with the World War II theme, The New Look follows Christian Dior, Coco Chanel, Pierre Balmain, and Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga as they lay the path for modern fashion in Nazi-occupied Paris. The cast features Ben Mendelsohn as Christian Dior, Juliette Binoche as Coco Chanel, and Maisie Williams as Catherine Dior, and also has a soundtrack courtesy of Jack Antonoff that\u2019s chock full of early 20th-century music covered by the likes of Perfume Genius and Florence Welch.\n\nCriminal Record\n\nApple TV+\u2019s dramas are on a hot streak lately. Now that stellar series like For All Mankind and Slow Horses are finally getting audiences, the streamer is putting more in their queues with Criminal Record. Starring former Doctor Who Doctor Peter Capaldi, the crime drama follows two cops\u2014Capaldi\u2019s Daniel Hegarty and Cush Jumbo\u2019s June Lenker\u2014as they try to get to the bottom of a long-settled case. Daniel worked the case originally and got a confession; June got a fresh tip and wants him to reopen it and find out whether the man who went away for murder is actually innocent. Might sound a bit overdone, but the series also works in elements of law enforcement shortcomings and race in a rapidly-changing Britain for a series that\u2019s about more than just one case.\n\nHijack\n\nThere\u2019s this face Idris Elba does. He\u2019s been perfecting it since he was Stringer Bell on The Wire. It\u2019s the look of total calm even when he\u2019s talking about the most harrowing thing you can imagine. That face gets a full workout in Hijack, in which Elba plays a corporate negotiator who finds himself trying to settle things with a group of, yes, hijackers who have taken over the flight he\u2019s boarded to get home to his family. This series is seven episodes, roughly seven hours\u2014the same length of the flight, and it follows the drama in the air and the political maneuvering below before attempting to stick the landing. Do stay around until the end.\n\nFor All Mankind\n\nLong before Foundation, there was For All Mankind. The show not only set the tone for the kind of glossy prestige sci-fi Apple TV+ had ambitions to make, but it was also the streaming service's attempt to plant its flag in the realm of streaming giants. A solid slice of alternate history, the show starts with a very smart premise: What if the US had been edged out in putting a man on the moon? How would the space-race rivalry between the Americans and the Soviets have played out? It's mostly a slick, stylish, NASA-heavy period drama, but as this is from the brain of Ronald D. Moore, there are a few standout moments and episodes with attention shared around the large ensemble cast. It might be the best sci-fi show you're not watching, and if that's true you now have multiple seasons to catch up on.\n\nMessi Meets America\n\nIf your home screen hasn't made it obvious, Apple TV+ is super stoked about soccer these days. Messi Meets America is a six-part docuseries about all-star player Lionel Messi's move to Major League Soccer's Inter Miami club. The first three episodes aired on October 11, 2023, and subsequent episodes aired in conjunction with last year's MLS season. Messi Mania, indeed.\n\nLessons in Chemistry\n\nBased on the debut novel from science writer Bonnie Garmus, Lessons in Chemistry is the story of Elizabeth Zott (Brie Larson), who gets hired to host a cooking show after she's fired from the lab she was working in for doing science while female. Obviously, the show Elizabeth puts on ends up being about a lot more than just having dinner on the table at 6 pm, but we suggest you watch to find out just how revolutionary it is.\n\nThe Morning Show\n\nEvery streaming service needs a flashy mainstream drama with Hollywood heavyweights to pull in viewers. Apple TV+ has The Morning Show. When Alex Levy (Jennifer Aniston) loses her morning news program cohost Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell) following sexual misconduct accusations, she gets paired up with Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon). What unfolds is a #MeToo-era drama full of TV network intrigue and Sorkin-lite dialog. In its second season, it went deep on Covid-19, and in the third season the series' fictional network, UBA, finds itself dealing with the aftermath of a cyberattack. There's likely a new season coming in 2025, so now's a good time to catch up, or go back and refresh your memory.\n\nShining Girls\n\nThis Elisabeth Moss psychological thriller/murder mystery came out in 2022 and never really got the buzz it likely deserved. All of that to say, you should probably watch it if you haven't already. Moss plays Kirby, a woman who believes a recent Chicago murder may be linked to an attack on her many years prior. She teams with a Sun-Times reporter to investigate, but the deeper she digs the more her own reality starts to shift. Based on the book The Shining Girls by Lauren Beukes, this series may seem like just another murder mystery, but its sci-fi twists put it one step ahead.\n\nFoundation\n\nWIRED called Foundation a \u201cflawed masterpiece\u201d in our review of the first season. Considering the complexities of adapting a sprawling Isaac Asimov book series, it was high praise. Starring Jared Harris as Hari Seldon, a math professor who, along with his loyal followers, is exiled for predicting the oncoming end of the galactic empire that rules over them, the show often suffers under the weight of its own massive scope. But it also features wonderful performances from Lee Pace and beautiful images inspired by the James Webb Space Telescope. If you have a soft spot for big sci-fi dramas, this Game-of-Thrones-in-space wannabe is a must-watch.\n\nThe Crowded Room\n\nSet in the late 1970s, The Crowded Room stars Tom Holland as Danny Sullivan, a young man arrested after a grisly shooting in New York City. Following his arrest, this 10-episode limited series unfolds into a twisty whodunit as interrogator Rya Goodwin (Amanda Seyfried) tries to suss out what happened with the shooting and the peculiar events in Sullivan\u2019s past that may have shaped how he ended up involved. Holland told Extra that the shoot for The Crowded Room, which he also produced, \u201cbroke\u201d him, leading to him taking a yearlong hiatus from acting. Want to see why? Watch now.\n\nSilo\n\nAs WIRED's Kate Knibbs noted in the wake of Silo's release, this show is prestige sci-fi gold. Based on a dystopian book trilogy by Hugh Howey, the series focuses on a subterranean bunker\u2014the silo of the title\u2014where humanity has sequestered itself after the apocalypse. Some are hoping to win the chance to reproduce, some are trying to solve mysterious murders. Everyone watching is enjoying figuring out what's going on in this underground city\u2014and what's happening outside of it.\n\nTed Lasso\n\nOn paper, Ted Lasso sounds terrible. The inconceivable story of an American football coach who has never watched a game of soccer somehow landing himself a job as coach of a (fictional) Premier League club and trying to make up for his total lack of qualifications by being a nice guy. Sounds unwatchable, doesn\u2019t it? And yet Ted Lasso has captured the hearts and minds of viewers on both sides of the pond with its large-as-life cast and irresistibly wholesome messaging, hoovering up awards in the process. The third and final season his the streamer last year, so now is the perfect time to binge it all.\n\nHigh Desert\n\nThe Patricia Arquette\u2013aissance doesn\u2019t get as much ink as Matthew McConaughey or Keanu Reeves did during their second comings, but it\u2019s here\u2014in part thanks to the rise of streaming. Between The Act and Severance, Arquette has received some of the highest accolades of her long career recently, and High Desert is no exception. While coming to terms with the death of her mother, Peggy (Arquette)\u2014an addict\u2014decides she wants to pick up the pieces of her life and become a private investigator. She finds an unwitting employer/sometime mentor in Bruce Harvey (Brad Garrett), but not everyone is onboard with Peggy\u2019s career decisions\u2014namely, her straitlaced sister (Christine Taylor). It\u2019s an odd duck of a show, which is perfectly suited to Arquette\u2019s ethereal acting style, allowing her to seamlessly flit between moments of tragedy and laugh-out-loud comedy, with the audiences doing their best to keep up. The all-star cast is made even more impressive by recurring appearances from Bernadette Peters as Peggy\u2019s late mom.\n\nBig Beasts\n\nLook, Discovery doesn't get to corner the market on animal documentaries\u2014and this 10-part docuseries proves it. Featuring elephant seals, brown bears, orangutans, giant otters, and all kinds of massive mammals in between, it's the perfect thing if you just want to escape and learn a few tidbits about nature. But the best part? It's narrated by Tom Hiddleston, and there's just something charming about hearing the voice of Loki talk about a bunch of different animals he could turn himself into in the blink of an eye.\n\nShrinking\n\nDo you enjoy In Treatment but wish it was, you know, fun? Then Shrinking may be right for you. Created by Bill Lawrence and Brett Goldstein\u2014of Ted Lasso fame\u2014and Jason Segel, the show is about Jimmy (Segel), a therapist struggling to get over the death of his wife and reconnect with his daughter and patients. That may sound like a downer, and the show isn\u2019t without its harder moments, but it\u2019s buoyed by the fact that it\u2019s also a workplace comedy focusing on the therapy practice where Jimmy works alongside Harrison Ford\u2019s Paul and Jessica Williams\u2019 Gaby. Shrinking, ultimately, is about the things people do to cope, but it also features a dream team of a cast and one very memorable party scene featuring an (unrelated) vomit-soaked piano and a super-stoned Ford.\n\nServant\n\nCinematically, M. Night Shyamalan can be a little hit-or-miss, but Servant, which the filmmaker executive produces and occasionally directs, is stellar. It's about a Philadelphia couple\u2014a chef and a news anchor\u2014who lose a child only to have it mysteriously come back to life (maybe) with the arrival of their new nanny. (You really just need to watch the show for any of this to make sense.) Moody, freaky, and occasionally even funny, it'll suck you in. And now that it wrapped its fourth and final season, there\u2019s plenty to enjoy.\n\nThe Essex Serpent\n\nClaire Danes doing her best trembling-chin acting in period garb, Tom Hiddleston as a town vicar, rumors about a mysterious mythological serpent\u2014is there anything not to love about this show? No, there\u2019s not. The Essex Serpent, based on the novel by Sarah Perry, follows a recent widow (Danes) as she heads to the countryside in Essex to investigate a \u201csea dragon.\u201d There, she meets a vicar, Will (Hiddleston), who is far more skeptical of the serpent\u2019s existence. Lush and inviting, it\u2019s the ideal period mystery.\n\nSeverance\n\nOut of all the shows on this list, Severance may be the one that firmly established Apple TV+ as a streaming player with edgy prestige content. Adam Scott plays Mark, a man distraught by the death of his wife who opts to undergo Severance, a procedure that divides his memories of work from those of his life at home. He\u2019s quite happy with the setup until a former Lumon Industries coworker tracks him down when he\u2019s out-of-office, setting off a series of events that makes him question not only Severance but the work his company does. From there, it only gets more weird and bleak with each passing minute. Tense and heartbreaking, this show, the bulk of which was directed by Ben Stiller, will keep you guessing and questioning the whole way through.\n\nLittle America\n\nOriginally released when Donald Trump was still president of the United States, Little America was and remains a timely reminder of what actually makes America great. Each episode of this anthology series focuses on a different story of immigrants living in America. From an undocumented high school student who discovers a talent for squash to a \u201cbra whisperer\u201d in Brooklyn, every one of these 30-minute vignettes\u2014all of them based on real people\u2014is inspiring and important viewing.\n\nMythic Quest\n\nAn all-too-rare example of a video game TV show that really works, Mythic Quest is one of the best new workplace comedies of the past few years. Presented in perfectly bingeable half-hour episodes, the show follows a fictional game studio known for its World of Warcraft\u2013like MMO, Mythic Quest, as the people who make it slalom through their many quirky relationships. The writing is excellent, consistently funny and emotionally impactful when you least expect it, and the show manages to confront real issues in the industry without sacrificing laughs.\n\nDickinson\n\nHailee Steinfeld is a riotous young Emily Dickinson in this half-hour show from creator Alena Smith. It was part of the original Apple TV+ lineup and quickly distinguished itself thanks to its off-kilter vision of 19th-century Amherst, Massachusetts. The first season is a set of sharp, surreal vignettes, inspired by Dickinson's work and tracing the imagined life of the young poet, who is rebelling against her father, the town's societal rules, and just about everything else. The second and third seasons go deeper, examining not only the poet's life, but also the roles that race, gender, sexuality, and class played in the early days of America. If you're a Dickinson stan, love a bit of smart queer dramedy, or just have a penchant for a modern soundtrack in a Civil War\u2013era show, you\u2019ll dig this.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast', 'Angela Watercutter', 'Wired Staff', 'Eric Ravenscraft', 'Jennifer M.

The book takes a more realistic approach to space adventure, eschewing familiar tropes such as FTL drives and instantaneous communication.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m reading science fiction, one of the things I can really get into is stuff that\u2019s got a lot of scientific grounding,\u201d Mixon says in Episode 517 of the Geek\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy podcast. \u201cWhen I write, I try to really delve into that challenge of \u2018How can I make this believable but still really blow the reader\u2019s mind?'\u201d\n\nUp Against It paints a vivid picture of a space colony full of asteroid miners, gene hackers, and Martian mobsters. One interesting detail is \u201cthe Circuit,\u201d a rite of passage in which characters make a 13-year voyage around the asteroid belt. \u201cParticularly because people live longer [in the future], they feel like they can afford to do that,\u201d Mixon says. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like the people who climb Everest, only I think there\u2019s a little bit more of a sense that you\u2019re not really a \u2018stroider unless you can say that you\u2019ve done this.\u201d\n\nOne of the book\u2019s main characters is Jane Navio, commissioner of resource management on 25 Phocaea.

Mixon in Episode 517 of Geek\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy (above). And check out some highlights from the discussion below.\n\nLaura J. Mixon on her first novel Astropilots:\n\nMelinda Snodgrass was friends with Ellen Datlow, who was the acquiring editor for this new YA series they were launching. They were looking for proposals, and all of a sudden I just had this flash of what I knew I wanted to write. I sat down and I wrote the first three chapters and an outline in just a very short period of time\u2014while I was still sick with the flu, during the Thanksgiving weekend\u2014and then sent it out. And then, in a week and a half or two weeks, Ellen contacted me and told me she wanted to buy it. I was flabbergasted. I never thought it would be that easy.\n\nLaura J. Mixon on her novel Proxies:\n\nI was learning how to write that as I went. It\u2019s a multi-viewpoint story. The first character you meet has amnesia, and it turns out that person is actually one of three personalities that occupy the same body. That person is a young man who has been trained to basically split his consciousness\u2014essentially he has [dissociative identity disorder]\u2014but it was induced so that he could control different proxy bodies at the same time. One of them is a woman, and she is one of the main characters of the book. That\u2019s a challenging thing to write\u2014and probably to read\u2014but I do have a lot of fondness for that book.\n\nLaura J. Mixon on asteroids:\n\nThe first scene I wrote [in Up Against It] was actually from Jane\u2019s perspective, when she\u2019s swinging out on the vines. They have these tethers, which is one way that they can travel among different asteroids. There are three that are strung along in the same orbit, and they use ion correctional jets to keep them aligned, but the rest of it, there\u2019s what I call \u201ctreeways,\u201d which are these rigid cables that span out from the cables among those three asteroids\u2014because asteroids are really far apart. Whenever you see in the movies where they have all these asteroids clustered together, that\u2019s not the way it really looks.\n\nLaura J. Mixon on research:\n\nOne of my clients was a mining company, BHP Billiton, and David Porterfield was my main contact. So a lot of the mining details, he was very happy for me to interview him and get information about the kinds of challenges that miners face and speculate about, \u201cWhat would it be like in a microgravity environment?\u201d I told him that I wanted Geoff and his friends to have something plausible but funky and weird to fight off the baddies when they get cornered in Geoff\u2019s little claim, and he told me about potato guns. He said, \u201cI actually have one and we can go out and fire it.\u201d It was loads of fun.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories", "authors": "[\"Geek'S Guide To The Galaxy\", 'Powered Outbrain', 'Kayla Lacour', 'Echo Esc_Html', 'Wired_Get_The_Byline_Name', 'Related_Video']", "top_image": "https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Asteroid-Belt-Up-Against-It-Culture-460713865-1200x630.jpg", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.wired.com/2022/06/geeksguide-up-against-it/#intcid=_wired-verso-hp-trending_500bb0ca-2855-4b75-8a64-a4695c2a4362_popular4-1_fallback_cral-top2-2", "timestamp": "1719366037.4763038", "displayed": 0}

The 12-episode series follows the crew from interstellar cargo vessel Demeter 227, stranded on the uncharted world of Vesta with seemingly no escape. (The bizarre creatures that call the planet home may be the least of the survivors\u2019 concerns.) Originally commissioned, then unjustly canceled, by Max, this spectacular animated show deserves your attention (especially since Netflix may extend its run if enough people watch).\n\nSweet Tooth\n\nBased on the comic book by Jeff Lemire, Sweet Tooth is set 10 years after \u201cThe Sick,\u201d a viral pandemic that killed most of the population and led\u2014somehow\u2014to babies being born with part-human, part-animal characteristics. The series follows Gus (Christian Convery), a half-deer hybrid boy who leaves the wilderness in search of his mother, and \u201cBig Man\u201d Tommy Jeppard (Nonso Anozie), a grizzled traveler who becomes his reluctant guide, protecting him from surviving humans who hate and fear the hybrids. The newly dropped third and final season ramps up the conflict between the two increasingly diverged species, while Gus and Jeppard face a final confrontation with Aditya Singh (Adeel Akhtar), a scientist researching the origins of The Sick, whose obsession with Gus has now taken on a religious fervor. Part sci-fi, part fantasy, part mystery, Sweet Tooth offers viewers a post-apocalyptic dystopia unlike any other.\n\nEric\n\nCreated and written by Abi Morgan (screenwriter of The Iron Lady and Suffragette), this psychological thriller follows TV puppeteer Vincent Anderson (Benedict Cumberbatch) and his wife Cassie (Gaby Hoffmann), left traumatized when their son Edgar (Ivan Morris Howe) goes missing. But while Detective Ledroit (McKinley Belcher III) investigates, brushing up against the darkest edges of Eric's 1980s New York setting, Vincent pursues other avenues\u2014like bringing the giant puppet Eric, designed by Edgar, to life onscreen in order to lure his son home. The distraught actions of a desperate father? Maybe\u2014but when Eric starts talking to Vincent, everything takes a far more surreal turn. While there are shades of the similarly imaginary-friend-tinged Happy! to Eric, this limited series leans more into themes of grief, loss, and the breakdown of relationships, material its cast almost uniformly mines to deliver star turns throughout.\n\nBridgerton\n\nStill ranking as one of Netflix\u2019s most-watched series ever, Bridgerton is set during the Regency period in England and follows the powerful Bridgerton family as they navigate love, marriage, and scandal\u2014with most of the latter stirred up by the gossip columns penned by the anonymous Lady Whistledown. Created for screen by Chris Van Dusen and executive produced by Shonda Rhimes, this incredibly bingeable and shockingly entertaining show is based on a series of novels by Julia Quinn, with each season focusing on a different branch of the Bridgerton tree. The third and latest season sees the spotlight fall on the long-simmering relationship between wallflower Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan) and Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton), a pairing that threatens to reveal powerful secrets that have been bubbling away since the very first episode.\n\nDead Boy Detectives\n\nEdwin Payne died in 1916. Charles Rowland passed in 1989. United in death, together they solve mysteries\u2014ghost mysteries! On the surface, The Sandman spinoff Dead Boy Detectives seems ludicrous, but its breezy pace and bounty of weird ideas (including a Cat King, a walrus cursed to live as a human, and a demon named David) keep things interesting. A solid central cast\u2014George Rexstrew as uptight Edwin, Jayden Revri as bruiser Charles, and Kassius Nelson as their psychic (and living) ally Crystal Palace\u2014bristle with chemistry, while the longer mysteries of how the deceased protagonists passed and why they choose to linger on Earth offer a touch more depth and emotional heft. It's got more of a YA flair than the parent series\u2014think Buffy meets Smallville, rather than the philosophically tinged Sandman\u2014but a few well-placed cameos, including Death (Kirby, formerly credited as Kirby Howell-Baptiste) and Despair (Donna Preston), help connect the two. A palate-cleansing crowd pleaser to fill the gap before The Sandman itself returns.\n\nChicken Nugget\n\nSome shows really make you stop and think about big, meaningful, existential questions. For example: \"What is it like to live as a chicken nugget?\" Adapted from a Korean webtoon by Park Ji-dok\u2014whose other work includes a comic called Killer Farts, as a starting reference point\u2014Chicken Nugget follows Choi Sun-man (Ryu Seung-ryong), president of technology company More Than Machines, and his eccentric intern Baek-joong (Ahn Jae-hong) as they seek a way to return Sun-man's daughter Min-ah (Kim You-jung) to human form after she's accidentally transformed into a \u2026 well, it's in the title. Look, there's no getting around how utterly weird this one is, but somehow, this incredibly surreal show somersaults over its bizarre premise to become an unexpectedly warm and endearing tale of human connection. Netflix's strangest series in years, but also oddly compelling.\n\nBlood of Zeus\n\nYou'd be forgiven for thinking this adult animated take on Greek mythology was another victim of Netflix's tendency to cancel shows with impunity\u2014the first season dropped in 2020, then, despite a relatively early renewal order, nothing, (Clearly nothing else happened that year to explain the delay \u2026) Now, four years later, the odyssey of demigod Heron, son of Zeus and mortal woman Electra, makes a welcome return. Picking up with Olympus in disarray following a godly coup and the fate of the cosmos at stake, Heron is sent on a decidedly more personal quest to rescue\u2014and possibly redeem\u2014his estranged brother. Blood of Zeus continues to impress with smart twists on classic stories (its take on the relationship between Persephone and Hades being a particular highlight) and fantastic animation. Let's just hope it's not another four years until the next season.\n\nBodkin\n\nWhen American podcaster Gilbert Power (Will Forte) and his enthusiastic assistant Emmy Sizergh (Robyn Cara) descend on the sleepy Irish town of Bodkin\u2014reluctantly aided by investigative journalist Dove Maloney (a brilliantly acerbic Siobh\u00e1n Cullen, cussing out everyone who glances her way)\u2014he thinks he's going to crack a decades-old missing-persons cold case. What he finds is a community with absolutely zero interest in his investigation, and even less in his attempts to \u201cconnect\u201d with his Irish roots. But before long, the villagers' quirky behavior starts to feel stereotypical, performative even\u2014and Power realizes the cold case may not be quite so chilly. Bodkin suffers from a slow start\u2014give it at least two episodes before writing it off as not for you\u2014but once this darkly comedic mystery gets going, you'll likely be just as invested as in your favorite true crime podcast. (Just don't take inspiration and try sleuthing any cold cases yourself.)\n\n3 Body Problem\n\nIn 1960s China, at the height of the Cultural Revolution, gifted scholar Wenjie Ye witnesses her physicist father being beaten to death for his research, only for her to be recruited to a secret project relying on that same knowledge. Fast-forward to the present day, and physics is broken: Particle accelerators around the world are delivering impossible data, while scientists are being plagued by countdowns only they can see. Meanwhile, strange VR headsets appear to be transporting players to an entirely different world\u2014and humanity\u2019s continued existence may rely on there being no \u201cgame over.\u201d Game of Thrones\u2019 creators D. B. Weiss and David Benioff and True Blood executive producer Alexander Woo reimagine Chinese author Cixin Liu\u2019s acclaimed hard sci-fi trilogy of first contact and looming interplanetary conflict as a more global affair. Wildly ambitious, and boasting an international cast featuring the likes of Benedict Wong, Rosalind Chao, Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez, and GOT alum John Bradley, Netflix's 3 Body Problem serves up the opening salvo in a richly detailed and staggeringly complex saga.\n\nParasyte: The Grey\n\nAlien spores rain down on Earth, releasing aggressive larvae driven to burrow into other creatures' heads, devour the brain, and take control of the body. Once in possession, these parasites are indistinguishable from regular people\u2014apart from the ability to warp the flesh and bone of their hosts' head into terrible weapons, which they use to hunt and consume humans from the shadows. Su-in Jeong (So-nee Jeon) almost became one of them, but when the parasite trying to take control of her exhausts itself saving her from a violent attacker, she\u2019s left sharing her body with an increasingly self-aware monster. Helmed by Train to Busan director Sang-ho Yeon, this Korean drama expands the world established in Hitoshi Iwaaki's sci-horror manga Parasyte, building on its social and environmental themes even as it delivers a terrific, and often terrifying, slice of body horror.\n\nRipley\n\nPerhaps best known nowadays from 1999\u2019s The Talented Mr. Ripley starring Matt Damon, novelist Patricia Highsmith\u2019s inveterate criminal Tom Ripley has a longer, darker legacy in print and on the screen. For this limited series, creator Steven Zaillian goes back to Highsmith's original text, presenting Ridley (a never-more-sinister Andrew Scott of All of Us Strangers) as a down-on-his-luck con man in 1950s New York who is recruited by a wealthy shipbuilder to travel to Italy and persuade the businessman\u2019s spoiled son Dickie Greenleaf (Johnny Flynn) to return home. But once in Italy, Ripley finds himself enamored with Dickie's lavish lifestyle\u2014and will do anything to take it for himself. Shot in black and white to really sell its noir credentials, this is an instant contender for the finest interpretation of Highsmith's works to date.\n\nGirls5eva\n\nSaving it from Peacock after two seasons, Netflix has gotten the band back together for this sharp comedy from creator Meredith Scardino. Twenty years after they split up, girl group Girls5Eva\u2014Dawn (Sara Bareilles), Gloria (Paula Pell), Summer (Busy Philipps), and Wickie (Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry)\u2014find themselves back in demand after their one big hit is sampled by popular rapper Li'l Stinker (Jeremiah Craft). Turning their renewed popularity into an opportunity to reunite, the women try to gain the stardom, respect, and musical integrity they never had in their youth, even as life has taken them in very different directions. Poking fun at the absurdity of the late \u201990s/early \u201900s pop scene\u2014and how little has changed since\u2014and heightened by an almost surrealist edge in places, Girls5eva is a comedy that deserves its time in the spotlight.\n\nAvatar: The Last Airbender\n\nA talented young cast bring to life the tale of Aang (Gordon Cormier), the latest in a long line of avatars who can control all four cardinal elements, but is frozen in time for a century when his world needed him most. Awakened by new friends Katara (Kiawentiio) and Sokka (Ian Ousley), he sets about continuing his training as the Avatar in an attempt to restore balance, all the while pursued by the relentless Prince Zuko (Dallas Liu), heir to the imperialist Fire Nation that has conquered the word. Consider this a cautious recommendation\u2014the original animated version, also on Netflix, remains superior\u2014but Netflix's live action Avatar remake serves up scale and spectacle, without betraying the heart of the classic show. It's also already confirmed for two more seasons, so viewers can look forward to the complete saga without the now-familiar Netflix cancellation worries.\n\nThe Legend of Korra\n\nIf you're still not sold on the live-action Avatar, this sequel to the original series is well worth your time. Set 70 years after the animated Avatar: The Last Airbender, The Legend of Korra explores how Aang's world has progressed after decades of relative peace. When Korra, the new Avatar, moves to Republic City to complete her training under the tutelage of Tenzin\u2014Aang's son, now with a family of his own\u2014she finds herself and new friends Mako and Bolin caught in the growing tensions between element benders and the Equalist movement, who claim the unpowered are an oppressed class. As the series progresses over its four seasons, The Legend of Korra proves itself a very different beast than its predecessor, exploring political themes and social prejudices in deeper\u2014and often darker\u2014detail, while also expanding the more fantastic elements of the universe and revealing the origins of the first Avatar. Even more brilliantly animated, and with a unique 1920s inspired aesthetic, Korra is a show that grew up alongside its audience, and is all the stronger for it.\n\nThe Gentlemen\n\nCreated by Guy Ritchie, and loosely following his 2019 film of the same name, this darkly comedic series follows Eddie Horniman (Theo James), a former British Army officer, after he inherits the family estate and title of Duke following his father's death. Oh, and the massive cannabis farm hidden beneath the grounds. Drawn into a literal criminal underground, Eddie finds himself having to deal with his family's legacy, his only real support coming from Susie (Kaya Scodelario), who's been running the drug empire. With a cast bolstered by Ray Winstone as Bobby Glass, Susie's incarcerated father and criminal kingpin, and Giancarlo Esposito as Stanley Johnston, an American investor with his own designs on the Horniman estate, The Gentlemen is a violent and blood-splattered crime caper in the heart of the British aristocracy. Consider it the antithesis of The Crown\u2014or not far removed from it, depending on your stance on the British Monarchy.\n\nGriselda\n\nCharting the life of infamous drug lord Griselda Blanco, who rose from a desperate life in Colombia to become a major player in the Miami drug wars, this dramatization shines largely thanks to a phenomenal performance from Sof\u00eda Vergara in the title role, channeling a chilling persona that makes her turn on Modern Family seem a lifetime away. While not entirely historically accurate, this limited series (co-created by Narcos' Doug Miro) weaves a mesmerizing tale of Blanco's efficiency in dominating the cocaine trade\u2014and her brutality in enforcing that control. A tight six episodes makes for a compelling, if shockingly violent, binge watch.\n\nStar Trek: Prodigy\n\nParamount+'s loss is Netflix's gain with the license rescue of this great Star Trek spinoff. Kicking off on a distant prison planet, a group of young escapees are forced to become a crew when they commandeer a lost\u2014and highly experimental\u2014Starfleet vessel. Guided by a hologram version of Star Trek: Voyager's iconic Captain Janeway (voiced by the venerable Kate Mulgrew), the untested cadets face a crash course in Federation ethics as they try to escape their former captor. While aimed at younger audiences and intended as an intro to the wider Trek universe, Prodigy packs in plenty for older Trekkies to appreciate\u2014and with the complete first season available now and another 20-episode season expected later in 2024, there's a lot to enjoy.\n\nQueer Eye\n\nThe Fab Five are back for another round of life-changing makeovers in New Orleans. With heroes including a deaf football coach who needs to step up to support his students, a Kiss superfan committed to caring for his brother, and a former nun looking for love, there's plenty to tug at the heart strings. With this season marking the last for design guru Bobby Berk, Queer Eye will doubtlessly be evolving when it returns for its already-confirmed ninth season, but for now, grab the tissues and prepare to ugly-happy-cry again.\n\nOne Day\n\nBased on David Nicholls' 2009 novel of the same name, this limited series charts the lives of Emma (Ambika Mod) and Dexter (Leo Woodall) over the course of 20 years. Starting with their graduation from Edinburgh University in 1988, each episode jumps forward one year at a time, revisiting them for a single day and exploring how their existences swirl around each other, even as fate seems to drag them apart. It's all gorgeously shot and produced, each half-hour episode a time capsule of its period, while the sizzling chemistry between the leads keeps you rooting for them even when you begin to suspect they're not meant for each other. An unexpectedly beautiful romcom.\n\nBeef\n\nEver been cut off in traffic? Ever had it happen when you\u2019re having a really bad day? Ever just wanted to take the low road, chase the person down and make them pay?! Then\u2014after a few deep breaths\u2014Beef is the show for you. It's a pressure valve for every petty grievance you\u2019ve ever suffered, following rich Amy (Ali Wong) and struggling Danny (Steven Yeun) as they escalate a road rage encounter into a vengeance-fueled quest to destroy the other. Yet Beef is more than a city-wide revenge thriller\u2014it's a biting look at how crushing modern life can be, particularly in its LA setting, where extravagant wealth brushes up against inescapable poverty and seemingly no one is truly happy. Part dramedy, part therapy, Beef is a bad example of conflict resolution but a cathartic binge watch that clearly resonates\u2014as evidenced by its growing clutch of awards, including the Golden Globe for Best Limited Series.\n\nLoudermilk\n\nSomething of a sleeper hit for years\u2014its first two seasons debuted on AT&T's now-defunct pay TV channel Audience in 2017, before its third season appeared over on Amazon\u2014all three seasons of this bleak comedy are now available on Netflix. Ron Livingston stars as Sam Loudermilk, a vitriolic former music critic and recovering alcoholic who proves almost pathologically incapable of holding his tongue when faced with life's small frustrations\u2014a personality type possibly ill-suited to leading others through addiction support groups. It's dark in places, and its central character is deliberately unlikeable, but smart writing and smarter performances shape this into something of an acerbic anti-Frasier.\n\nScott Pilgrim Takes Off\n\nAdapted from the beloved graphic novel series by Bryan Lee O'Malley, animated by one of the most exciting and dynamic studios in Japan, and voiced by the entire returning cast of director Edgar Wright's 2010 live-action adaption, Scott Pilgrim Takes Off would have been cult gold even if it was a straight retelling of its eponymous slacker's battles against lover Ramona Flowers' seven evil exes. Yet somehow, in a world devoid of surprises, this packs in killer twists from the very first episode, making for a show that's as fresh and exciting as ever. Saying anything else would ruin it\u2014just watch.\n\nSweet Home\n\nBased on the Korean webcomic by Kim Carnby and Hwang Young-chan, Sweet Home offers a very different vision of apocalyptic end times\u2014rather than pandemics, disasters, or even zombies, this posits an end of the world brought about by people's transformation into grotesque monsters, each unique and seemingly based on their deepest desires when they were human. The first season was a masterclass in claustrophobic horror, as the residents of an isolated, run-down apartment building\u2014chiefly suicidal teen Cha Hyun-soo (Song Kang), former firefighter Seo Yi-kyung (Lee Si-young), and Pyeon Sang-wook (Lee Jin-wook), who may be a brutal gangster\u2014battled for survival, while the long-awaited second season explores what remains of the wider world, delving into the true nature of both monster and man. With phenomenal effects work blending prosthetics, CGI, and even stop-motion animation for some disturbingly juddering creatures, this stands apart from the horror crowd.\n\nCastlevania: Nocturne\n\nFrance, 1792: as the French Revolution rages, citizens rise up against a parasitic ruling class\u2014but vampire hunter Richter Belmont and his magic-wielding ally Maria Renard are more concerned with what's literally bleeding the people dry. Yet conventional bloodsuckers turn out to be the least of their worries when the pair meets Annette and Edouard, who have travelled halfway around the world to warn of a coming \"Vampire Messiah\" prophesized to devour the sun\u2014let's just say the stakes have never been higher (sorry). Set centuries after the previous Castlevania animated series, this proves a perfect jumping on point while maintaining the high quality animation, tight plotting, and brilliant action that made the original such a hit.\n\nBodies\n\nFour detectives. Four time periods. Four murders? Maybe\u2014but only one body. This time-twisting thriller\u2014adapted from the comic of the same name by writer Si Spencer and artists Tula Lotay, Meghan Hetrick, Dean Ormston, and Phil Winslade\u2014hops from Victorian London to a dystopian future and back again, as the same corpse is found in the same spot in each era. The only thing stranger than the impossible crime itself is the conspiracy behind it, one that spans decades, impacting and linking every figure investigating the body. A brilliantly high-concept sci-fi crime drama, Bodies is one of the best one-and-done limited series to hit Netflix in years.\n\nPluto\n\nThink you know Astro Boy? Think again. In 2003, Naoki Urasawa (Monster, 20th Century Boys) updated original creator Osamu Tezuka's hugely influential \"The Greatest Robot on Earth\" story arc for his manga Pluto, opting for a more adult approach. The focus shifts from the heroic boy robot to grizzled cybernetic detective Gesicht as he investigates a series of murders of both humans and robots, each victim left with makeshift horns crammed into their heads. Meanwhile, Atom (Astro's Japanese name) is recast as a former peace ambassador, effectively a propaganda tool rolled out at the end of the 39th Central Asian War, still dealing with trauma from the experience. This adaptation is not only a faithful recreation of Urasawa's retelling, but is stunningly animated to a standard rarely seen in Netflix's original anime productions. With eight episodes, each around an hour long, this is as prestigious as any live-action thriller the streamer has produced, and a testament to both Tezuka and Urasawa's respective geniuses.\n\nBlue Eye Samurai\n\nIn the 17th Century, Japan enforced its \"sakoku\" isolationist foreign policy, effectively closing itself off from the world. Foreigners were few and far between\u2014so when Mizu (voiced by Maya Erskine) is born with blue eyes, nine months after her mother was assaulted by one of the four white men in the country, it marks her as an outsider, regarded as less than human. Years later, after being trained by a blind sword master and now masquerading as a man, Mizu hunts down those four men, knowing that killing them all is the only way to guarantee her vengeance. Exquisitely animated\u2014which makes its unabashed violence all the more graphic\u2014and with a phenomenal voice cast bolstered by the likes of George Takei, Brenda Song, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, and Kenneth Branagh, Blue Eye Samurai is one of the best adults-only animated series on Netflix.\n\nSex Education\n\nTalking about sex with your parents is always awkward, but for teenager Otis (Asa Butterfield) it's even worse: His mother Jean (a captivating Gillian Anderson) is a renowned sex therapist who won't stop talking about sex, leaving Otis himself ambivalent toward it. Still, something must have sunk in, and after helping a fellow student navigate a sexual conundrum, Otis finds himself almost accidentally running his own sex therapy clinic on campus. While the situations are often played for laughs, over its four seasons Sex Education thoughtfully explores intimacy, sexuality, and relationships in tender and even profound ways. With a fantastic ensemble cast including incoming Doctor Who star Ncuti Gatwa as Otis' best friend Eric and Emma Mackey as love interest Maeve, this UK-set and Welsh-filmed coming-of-age dramedy has proven itself one of Netflix's best series.\n\nLa R\u00e9volution\n\nIn a triumph of on-the-nose conceptualizing, La R\u00e9volution spins an alt-history romp in on-the-cusp-of-revolt France, where the cruel aristocracy become literal \u201cblue-bloods,\u201d thanks to a contagion that turns them into inky-veined, dandyish fiends ravenous for human flesh. A plucky reformist contessa who sympathizes with the commoners\u2019 plight\u2014first being exploited by the ruling class, and then being eaten by them\u2014allies with forces both rebel and supernatural as she tries to prevent the undead disease spreading from the elite of Versaille to the whole of France\u2019s upper crust. The melding of surprisingly great production values and a cast that\u2019s clearly enjoying themselves elevates this above your standard zombie nonsense\u2014and it\u2019s subtitled, which definitely means it\u2019s art house, right?\n\nPending Train\n\nNetflix: License one of Japan\u2019s best SF dramas in years. Also Netflix: Do nothing, literally nothing, to promote it, not even create an English subbed trailer. Which is where WIRED comes in\u2014Pending Train is a show you (and Netflix) shouldn\u2019t sleep on. When a train carriage is mysteriously transported into a post-apocalyptic future, the disparate passengers\u2019 first concern is simply survival. Between exploring their new surroundings and clashing with people from another stranded train car over scarce resources, one group\u2014including hairdresser Naoya, firefighter Yuto, and teacher Sae\u2014begins to realize that there may be a reason they\u2019ve been catapulted through time: a chance to go back and avert the disaster that ruined the world. A tense, 10-episode journey, Pending Train offers a Japanese twist on Lost, but one with tighter pacing and showrunners who actually have a clue where they want the story to go.\n\nOne Piece\n\nMark one up for persistence: After numerous anime adaptations ranging from \u201cawful\u201d to \u201cnot too bad,\u201d Netflix finally strikes gold with its live-action take on the global phenomenon One Piece. Despite fans\u2019 fears, this spectacularly captures the charm, optimism, and glorious weirdness of Eiichiro Oda\u2019s beloved manga, manifesting a fantasy world where people brandish outlandish powers and hunt for a legendary treasure in an Age of Piracy almost verbatim from the page. The perfectly cast I\u00f1aki Godoy stars as Monkey D. Luffy, would-be King of the Pirates, bringing an almost elastic innate physicality to the role that brilliantly matches the characters rubber-based stretching powers, while the crew Luffy gathers over this first season\u2014including swordsmaster Roronoa Zoro (Mackenyu), navigator and skilled thief Nami (Emily Rudd), sharpshooter Usopp (Jacob Romero Gibson), and martial artist chef Sanji (Taz Skylar)\u2014all brilliantly embody their characters. A lot could have gone wrong bringing One Piece to life, but this is a voyage well worth taking.\n\nRagnarok\n\nIf you're a fan of Norse mythology but Marvel's Thor got too goofy for you with Love and Thunder, this Norwegian fantasy drama may be more to your liking. Set in the present day, young Magne Seier (David Stakston) finds he is the reincarnation of the god of thunder just in time to take a stand against the sinister Jutul family, whose polluting factories blight his hometown of Edda. No, the show is not subtle with its references, nor its environmental message, but it's a fun reimagining of myth, especially as more members of the Norse pantheon start cropping up. Best of all, with only three six-episode seasons and an actual ending\u2014no surprise cancellations here!\u2014it's a nicely digestible binge-watch.\n\nThe Chosen One\n\nBased on the comic American Jesus by writer Mark Millar (Kick-Ass, Kingsman) and artist Peter Gross (Lucifer), The Chosen One follows 12-year-old Jodie (Bobby Luhnow), raised in Mexico by his mother Sarah (Dianna Agron). While the young boy would rather hang out with his friends, his life\u2014and potentially the world\u2014changes forever when he starts exhibiting miraculous powers, attracting dangerous attention from sinister forces. While this could have been yet another formulaic entry in Netflix's expansive library of supernatural teen dramas (the Stranger Things vibe is particularly strong), the decision to shoot on film and in a 4:3 aspect ratio make this a visual delight, unlike almost anything else on the streamer at present. There's an English dub, but stick to the original Spanish with English subs for a better viewing experience. (Confusingly, there's another show with the exact same title on Netflix, a 2019 Brazilian series following a trio of relief doctors in a village dominated by a cult leader\u2014also worth a watch, but don't get them confused!)\n\nHeartstopper\n\nArguably the most joyful show on Netflix is back for another school year of teen drama and heartfelt romance. With Charlie (Joe Locke) and Nick (Kit Connor) now officially dating, this long-awaited second season starts off with Nick struggling to come out as bisexual\u2014but it\u2019s openly-gay Charlie\u2019s parents who seem to struggle the most with their relationship. Meanwhile, Elle (Yasmin Finney) and Tao\u2019s (William Gao) will-they-won\u2019t-they saga continues to sizzle, and a school trip to Paris turns into a crucible for everyone\u2019s emotions. Although it steps into slightly darker terrain this season, the brilliant adaptation of Alice Oseman\u2019s graphic novels continues to be an utter delight\u2014the show younger LGBTQ+ viewers need now, older ones needed years ago, and that everyone needs to watch whatever your sexuality.\n\nCobra Kai\n\nWhile this latter day sequel to The Karate Kid films of the 1980s started life on YouTube Red (remember that?), it\u2019s really come into its own since moving to Netflix. Picking up decades after Daniel LaRusso and Johnny Lawrence\u2019s iconic fight at the end of the first movie, the debut season of Cobra Kai finds the tables turned, with Daniel living the charmed life while Johnny is washed up. Yet after defending his young neighbor Miguel (Xolo Maridue\u00f1a) in a fight, Johnny finds new meaning by re-opening the eponymous karate dojo and guiding a new generation of students. As the series progresses, the stakes get higher\u2014and frankly, increasingly, gloriously, ludicrous\u2014as rival martial arts schools start cropping up all over California and alliances are forged and broken with alarming regularity. It\u2019s all presented a little bit tongue-in-cheek, and with Ralph Macchio and William Zabka reprising their 1980s roles, the show is an unabashed love letter to the classic action flicks, but thanks to some seriously impressive fights and stunt work, and with a younger cast you can\u2019t help but root for, it\u2019s a retro-styled delight. With a sixth and final season in the works, now is the perfect time to binge the first five.\n\nCunk on Earth\n\nBritish comedy alert: This might not be for you. If, however, you appreciate drier-than-a-desert humor and cringe-inducingly awkward interviews, this is a must-watch. A perfectly framed lampoon of globe-trotting documentaries, Cunk on Earth sees host Philomena Cunk (in reality, comedian Diane Morgan) exploring world history, from the development of agriculture through to the space race, offering deranged insights and skewering real-world experts with incredibly stupid questions along the way. Morgan\u2019s relentlessly deadpan delivery alone makes this five-episode series worth a watch, but it\u2019s those interviews that make this comedy gold.\n\nGlitch\n\nTo those in the northern hemisphere, this Australian supernatural drama might be one of the best kept secrets of the last decade. Centred on a small town in Victoria, an entire community is shaken when seven people rise from their graves, seemingly in perfect health but with no memory of who they are or how they died. As police sergeant James Hayes (Patrick Brammall) and local doctor Elishia McKellar (Genevieve O'Reilly) try to contain and examine \u201cThe Risen,\u201d Hayes\u2019 world is rocked when he learns his own late wife Kate is among them. Over the course of three seasons and 18 episodes, the reasons for the dead\u2019s return is teased out, starting with simply \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhy,\u201d but building up to something that questions the rules of reality. A fantastic ensemble cast and brilliant pacing make this a must-see.\n\nBlack Mirror\n\nAs creator Charlie Brooker recently told WIRED, \u201cBlack Mirror wasn't meant to be \u2018this is what\u2019s going on in technology this week.\u2019 It was always designed to be a more paranoid and weird and hopefully unique show.\u201d And that it is, but rather than displaying what\u2019s going on in technology as it\u2019s happening, the show has a way of beating its viewers to the paranoid punch, addressing dystopian anxieties before they even happen. (Black Mirror was talking about AI long before your mom ever heard of ChatGPT.) There are now six seasons of Brooker's show on Netflix, and if you haven\u2019t watched, now may be the time. How else will you know what you\u2019ll be worried about five years from now?\n\nShe-Ra and the Princesses of Power\n\nOn the planet Etheria, Adora loyally serves the Horde, rising through its ranks with her close friend Catra by her side, until the discovery of a strange sword transforms her into the legendary warrior She-Ra. Learning the truth about the oppressive forces she's served her whole life, Adora joins the Rebellion against the Horde\u2014but can she really turn her back on everything she's ever known? And will Catra ever forgive the betrayal? Developed by ND Stevenson\u2014whose own Nimona delighted viewers as an animated movie on Netflix\u2014the modern She-Ra reimagines the 1980s classic, eschewing the original's connection to He-Man and episodic structure in favor of its own unique mythology and long-form storytelling, packed with complex characters, high stakes, and some powerfully emotional moments. Perfect for fans of Avatar: The Last Airbender or The Legend of Korra, this dazzlingly animated five-season action-fantasy is as compelling for older fans as it is younger viewers\u2014and some of the best LGBTQ+ representation to be found in any medium doesn't hurt either.\n\nQueen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story\n\nA prequel spinoff to Bridgerton\u2014the Shondaland-produced Regency era historical romance that continues to break Netflix viewership records\u2014Queen Charlotte takes viewers back to 1761, exploring how a young Charlotte (India Amarteifio) meets and marries George III (Corey Mylchreest). In typical Bridgerton fashion though, there\u2019s far more going on than a period love story, with the spirited Charlotte initially trying to escape the arranged marriage before learning to navigate the corridors of power\u2014and manage George\u2019s deteriorating mental health. Interspersed with scenes in Bridgerton\u2019s \u201cpresent day\u201d 1817, where the now-formidable stateswoman Queen Charlotte (a returning Golda Rosheuvel) deals with a succession crisis to the throne, this limited series is compulsory viewing for fans of the series, and a great entry point for anyone yet to be wooed by its charms.\n\nInside Man\n\nJefferson Grieff (Stanley Tucci) is a former criminology professor on death row for killing his wife, telling his story to a journalist named Beth (Lydia West). Harry Watling (David Tennant) is an unassuming English vicar, tending to his parishioners. The two men are a world apart\u2014until a horrific misunderstanding leads to Watling trapping a friend of Beth's in his basement. As Watling's situation and mental state deteriorate, Beth turns to the killer for help finding her friend. Created and written by Stephen Moffat, this tense transatlantic thriller has just a dash of The Silence of the Lambs, and with a cast at the top of their game, it\u2019s gripping viewing. Best of all, its tight four episodes mean you can binge it in one go.\n\nThe Diplomat\n\nIf there's a West Wing-shaped hole in your life, look no further than The Diplomat\u2014a tense geopolitical thriller elevated beyond the norms of the genre by a superb central performance by The Americans' Keri Russell as Kate Wyler, newly appointed US ambassador to the UK. Far from being an easy assignment in a friendly country, Kate's role coincides with an attack on a British aircraft carrier, leaving her to defuse an international crisis before it escalates into full-blown war. It's a job that might go easier if her own special relationship with husband Hal (Rufus Sewell) weren't fraying, as his resentment at being demoted leads him to interfere in her efforts. One of Netflix's biggest hits of 2023, The Diplomat has already been renewed for season two.\n\nAlice in Borderland\n\nWhen slacker Ryohei Arisu (Kento Yamazaki) is mysteriously transported to a deserted Tokyo, his keen gaming skills give him an edge navigating a series of lethal games that test intellect as much as physical prowess. Yet after barely scraping through several rounds, Arisu is no closer to uncovering the secrets of this strange borderland, or to finding a way home\u2014and the stakes are about to get even higher. Not only are Arisu and his allies Usagi (Tao Tsuchiya), Kuina (Aya Asahina), and Chishiya (Nijiro Murakami) faced with another gauntlet of sadistic games, but they find themselves caught between rival card suit \u201ccourts\u201d vying for power\u2014and not everyone can be trusted.\n\nWith its willingness to kill off main characters at a moment\u2019s notice, the first season of this gripping adaptation of Haro Aso\u2019s manga kept viewers on tenterhooks throughout. As the long-awaited second season leans further into its twisted Alice in Wonderland imagery, expect more shocking developments in this taut thriller.\n\nArcane\n\nLet's be honest: Animated series based on video games often run the gamut from cheap cash-ins to half-decent if forgettable tie-ins, inaccessible to anyone but hardcore devotees. In contrast, Arcane stands apart from the crowd by making its connections to Riot Games' League of Legends almost optional. While its central figures, orphaned sisters Vi and Jinx, are playable characters in the game, viewers don't need foreknowledge of their story to enjoy this steampunk saga of class war, civil uprising, and the people caught in between. With a gorgeous painterly art style, strong characters, and frequently shocking story beats, Arcane defies its origins to become one of the best animated series in years\u2014and it has racked up plenty of awards, including a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program, to prove it.\n\nThe Sandman\n\nThe Sandman is one of the most beloved comic series of the past 40 years. A dark fantasy about dreams, reality, stories, and the mercurial relationship between them, Neil Gaiman's books have endured as essential reading for goth teens and literati alike. While attempts to bring the saga of Dream of the Endless\u2014sometimes known as Morpheus, immortal embodiment and master of the nightlands, fierce and terrible in his wrath\u2014to the screen have been underway practically since the comic debuted in 1988, this long-in-development Netflix adaptation is worth the wait. It\u2019s a perfect translation of the first two graphic novels in the series and follows Dream (a sombre and imposing Tom Sturridge) as he restores his power and kingdom after being held in captivity for a century by occultists who snared him instead of his sister Death (Kirby Howell-Baptiste). Fittingly, the show has a dreamlike pacing to it, blurring the lines between episodic narratives and longer arcs, and it is as likely to leave viewers crying over a gargoyle\u2019s fate as it is to shock them with the sadistic actions of an escaped nightmare-turned-serial killer named the Corinthian (Boyd Holbrook). The Sandman\u2019s journey to the screen might have been the stuff of restless nights, but the result is a dream you won\u2019t want to wake up from.\n\nStranger Things\n\nNetflix's nostalgic sci-fi/horror series is back for its fourth season, set six months after the Battle of Starcourt and with its core cast separated for the first time. The Byers family and Eleven are off in California, Hopper is still (somehow) in a Russian prison, and the remaining crew are home in Hawkins, Indiana, about to face down a terrifying new threat\u2014high school. Oh, and another incursion from the horrific Upside Down. The Duffer Brothers continue to offer up plenty of 1980s nostalgia for viewers who grew up on a diet of Spielberg, Lucas, and Craven, while upping the stakes with a significant new threat. Expect drama, scares, and\u2014of course\u2014plenty of Dungeons & Dragons as the cult show roars toward its fifth and final season.\n\nRussian Doll\n\nIn Russian Doll, Nadia has one very big problem: Time keeps breaking around her. Season one finds Nadia\u2014played by Natasha Lyonne, who is also a cocreator on the show\u2014dying at her own birthday party, only to wake up there over and over again, trapped in a Groundhog Day-style loop until she can unravel her personalized knot in the space-time continuum. Things only get stranger in season two, where Nadia finds herself traveling back in time to 1982 and inhabiting the body of her own mother\u2014currently heavily pregnant with Nadia herself. Both seasons are funny and thought-provoking, reflecting on personal and generational trauma, all without overegging the potential for philosophical musing.\n\nSquid Game\n\nProduced in Korea, Squid Game blends Hunger Games and Parasite with a battle-royal-style contest. Hundreds of desperate, broke people are recruited to a contest where they can win enough money to never need to worry about their debts again. All they have to do to win the \u20a945.6 billion ($35.8 million) jackpot is complete six children\u2019s games. But it\u2019s not that simple: All the games have a twist, and very few people make it out alive. Squid Game is intense, brutal, and often very graphic, but it is also completely gripping. Netflix\u2019s dubbing isn\u2019t the best in this instance, but the nine episodes are compelling enough to make up for it.\n\nLupin\n\nArs\u00e8ne Lupin, the belle epoque burglar created by French novelist Maurice Leblanc in the early 1900s, is reinvented as Assane Diop, a first-generation Frenchman with a mania for Lupin books and a grudge against the powerful forces who decades ago framed his father for a theft he didn\u2019t commit\u2014and led him to die in prison. Pairing drones, social media bots, and hacking skills with traditional tools of the trade like fake beards, picklocks, and quick wits, Diop hunts down his adversaries as he searches for the truth about his father\u2019s fate. In his spare time, Diop also tries to patch together a crumbling marriage and build a better rapport with his son. Worth watching in the French original, this five-episode series\u2019 strength lies in the dialog, the character development, and the charismatic performance of Omar Sy as Assane. The actual escapades and daring heists are beautifully choreographed, but a lot of the mechanics\u2014how a certain piece of legerdemain worked, when an impenetrable building was infiltrated\u2014are left to the viewer's imagination.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast', 'Matt Kamen', 'Wired Staff', 'Jennifer M.

The 12-episode series follows the crew from interstellar cargo vessel Demeter 227, stranded on the uncharted world of Vesta with seemingly no escape. (The bizarre creatures that call the planet home may be the least of the survivors\u2019 concerns.) Originally commissioned, then unjustly canceled, by Max, this spectacular animated show deserves your attention (especially since Netflix may extend its run if enough people watch).\n\nSweet Tooth\n\nBased on the comic book by Jeff Lemire, Sweet Tooth is set 10 years after \u201cThe Sick,\u201d a viral pandemic that killed most of the population and led\u2014somehow\u2014to babies being born with part-human, part-animal characteristics. The series follows Gus (Christian Convery), a half-deer hybrid boy who leaves the wilderness in search of his mother, and \u201cBig Man\u201d Tommy Jeppard (Nonso Anozie), a grizzled traveler who becomes his reluctant guide, protecting him from surviving humans who hate and fear the hybrids. The newly dropped third and final season ramps up the conflict between the two increasingly diverged species, while Gus and Jeppard face a final confrontation with Aditya Singh (Adeel Akhtar), a scientist researching the origins of The Sick, whose obsession with Gus has now taken on a religious fervor. Part sci-fi, part fantasy, part mystery, Sweet Tooth offers viewers a post-apocalyptic dystopia unlike any other.\n\nEric\n\nCreated and written by Abi Morgan (screenwriter of The Iron Lady and Suffragette), this psychological thriller follows TV puppeteer Vincent Anderson (Benedict Cumberbatch) and his wife Cassie (Gaby Hoffmann), left traumatized when their son Edgar (Ivan Morris Howe) goes missing. But while Detective Ledroit (McKinley Belcher III) investigates, brushing up against the darkest edges of Eric's 1980s New York setting, Vincent pursues other avenues\u2014like bringing the giant puppet Eric, designed by Edgar, to life onscreen in order to lure his son home. The distraught actions of a desperate father? Maybe\u2014but when Eric starts talking to Vincent, everything takes a far more surreal turn. While there are shades of the similarly imaginary-friend-tinged Happy! to Eric, this limited series leans more into themes of grief, loss, and the breakdown of relationships, material its cast almost uniformly mines to deliver star turns throughout.\n\nBridgerton\n\nStill ranking as one of Netflix\u2019s most-watched series ever, Bridgerton is set during the Regency period in England and follows the powerful Bridgerton family as they navigate love, marriage, and scandal\u2014with most of the latter stirred up by the gossip columns penned by the anonymous Lady Whistledown. Created for screen by Chris Van Dusen and executive produced by Shonda Rhimes, this incredibly bingeable and shockingly entertaining show is based on a series of novels by Julia Quinn, with each season focusing on a different branch of the Bridgerton tree. The third and latest season sees the spotlight fall on the long-simmering relationship between wallflower Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan) and Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton), a pairing that threatens to reveal powerful secrets that have been bubbling away since the very first episode.\n\nDead Boy Detectives\n\nEdwin Payne died in 1916. Charles Rowland passed in 1989. United in death, together they solve mysteries\u2014ghost mysteries! On the surface, The Sandman spinoff Dead Boy Detectives seems ludicrous, but its breezy pace and bounty of weird ideas (including a Cat King, a walrus cursed to live as a human, and a demon named David) keep things interesting. A solid central cast\u2014George Rexstrew as uptight Edwin, Jayden Revri as bruiser Charles, and Kassius Nelson as their psychic (and living) ally Crystal Palace\u2014bristle with chemistry, while the longer mysteries of how the deceased protagonists passed and why they choose to linger on Earth offer a touch more depth and emotional heft. It's got more of a YA flair than the parent series\u2014think Buffy meets Smallville, rather than the philosophically tinged Sandman\u2014but a few well-placed cameos, including Death (Kirby, formerly credited as Kirby Howell-Baptiste) and Despair (Donna Preston), help connect the two. A palate-cleansing crowd pleaser to fill the gap before The Sandman itself returns.\n\nChicken Nugget\n\nSome shows really make you stop and think about big, meaningful, existential questions. For example: \"What is it like to live as a chicken nugget?\" Adapted from a Korean webtoon by Park Ji-dok\u2014whose other work includes a comic called Killer Farts, as a starting reference point\u2014Chicken Nugget follows Choi Sun-man (Ryu Seung-ryong), president of technology company More Than Machines, and his eccentric intern Baek-joong (Ahn Jae-hong) as they seek a way to return Sun-man's daughter Min-ah (Kim You-jung) to human form after she's accidentally transformed into a \u2026 well, it's in the title. Look, there's no getting around how utterly weird this one is, but somehow, this incredibly surreal show somersaults over its bizarre premise to become an unexpectedly warm and endearing tale of human connection. Netflix's strangest series in years, but also oddly compelling.\n\nBlood of Zeus\n\nYou'd be forgiven for thinking this adult animated take on Greek mythology was another victim of Netflix's tendency to cancel shows with impunity\u2014the first season dropped in 2020, then, despite a relatively early renewal order, nothing, (Clearly nothing else happened that year to explain the delay \u2026) Now, four years later, the odyssey of demigod Heron, son of Zeus and mortal woman Electra, makes a welcome return. Picking up with Olympus in disarray following a godly coup and the fate of the cosmos at stake, Heron is sent on a decidedly more personal quest to rescue\u2014and possibly redeem\u2014his estranged brother. Blood of Zeus continues to impress with smart twists on classic stories (its take on the relationship between Persephone and Hades being a particular highlight) and fantastic animation. Let's just hope it's not another four years until the next season.\n\nBodkin\n\nWhen American podcaster Gilbert Power (Will Forte) and his enthusiastic assistant Emmy Sizergh (Robyn Cara) descend on the sleepy Irish town of Bodkin\u2014reluctantly aided by investigative journalist Dove Maloney (a brilliantly acerbic Siobh\u00e1n Cullen, cussing out everyone who glances her way)\u2014he thinks he's going to crack a decades-old missing-persons cold case. What he finds is a community with absolutely zero interest in his investigation, and even less in his attempts to \u201cconnect\u201d with his Irish roots. But before long, the villagers' quirky behavior starts to feel stereotypical, performative even\u2014and Power realizes the cold case may not be quite so chilly. Bodkin suffers from a slow start\u2014give it at least two episodes before writing it off as not for you\u2014but once this darkly comedic mystery gets going, you'll likely be just as invested as in your favorite true crime podcast. (Just don't take inspiration and try sleuthing any cold cases yourself.)\n\n3 Body Problem\n\nIn 1960s China, at the height of the Cultural Revolution, gifted scholar Wenjie Ye witnesses her physicist father being beaten to death for his research, only for her to be recruited to a secret project relying on that same knowledge. Fast-forward to the present day, and physics is broken: Particle accelerators around the world are delivering impossible data, while scientists are being plagued by countdowns only they can see. Meanwhile, strange VR headsets appear to be transporting players to an entirely different world\u2014and humanity\u2019s continued existence may rely on there being no \u201cgame over.\u201d Game of Thrones\u2019 creators D. B. Weiss and David Benioff and True Blood executive producer Alexander Woo reimagine Chinese author Cixin Liu\u2019s acclaimed hard sci-fi trilogy of first contact and looming interplanetary conflict as a more global affair. Wildly ambitious, and boasting an international cast featuring the likes of Benedict Wong, Rosalind Chao, Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez, and GOT alum John Bradley, Netflix's 3 Body Problem serves up the opening salvo in a richly detailed and staggeringly complex saga.\n\nParasyte: The Grey\n\nAlien spores rain down on Earth, releasing aggressive larvae driven to burrow into other creatures' heads, devour the brain, and take control of the body. Once in possession, these parasites are indistinguishable from regular people\u2014apart from the ability to warp the flesh and bone of their hosts' head into terrible weapons, which they use to hunt and consume humans from the shadows. Su-in Jeong (So-nee Jeon) almost became one of them, but when the parasite trying to take control of her exhausts itself saving her from a violent attacker, she\u2019s left sharing her body with an increasingly self-aware monster. Helmed by Train to Busan director Sang-ho Yeon, this Korean drama expands the world established in Hitoshi Iwaaki's sci-horror manga Parasyte, building on its social and environmental themes even as it delivers a terrific, and often terrifying, slice of body horror.\n\nRipley\n\nPerhaps best known nowadays from 1999\u2019s The Talented Mr. Ripley starring Matt Damon, novelist Patricia Highsmith\u2019s inveterate criminal Tom Ripley has a longer, darker legacy in print and on the screen. For this limited series, creator Steven Zaillian goes back to Highsmith's original text, presenting Ridley (a never-more-sinister Andrew Scott of All of Us Strangers) as a down-on-his-luck con man in 1950s New York who is recruited by a wealthy shipbuilder to travel to Italy and persuade the businessman\u2019s spoiled son Dickie Greenleaf (Johnny Flynn) to return home. But once in Italy, Ripley finds himself enamored with Dickie's lavish lifestyle\u2014and will do anything to take it for himself. Shot in black and white to really sell its noir credentials, this is an instant contender for the finest interpretation of Highsmith's works to date.\n\nGirls5eva\n\nSaving it from Peacock after two seasons, Netflix has gotten the band back together for this sharp comedy from creator Meredith Scardino. Twenty years after they split up, girl group Girls5Eva\u2014Dawn (Sara Bareilles), Gloria (Paula Pell), Summer (Busy Philipps), and Wickie (Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry)\u2014find themselves back in demand after their one big hit is sampled by popular rapper Li'l Stinker (Jeremiah Craft). Turning their renewed popularity into an opportunity to reunite, the women try to gain the stardom, respect, and musical integrity they never had in their youth, even as life has taken them in very different directions. Poking fun at the absurdity of the late \u201990s/early \u201900s pop scene\u2014and how little has changed since\u2014and heightened by an almost surrealist edge in places, Girls5eva is a comedy that deserves its time in the spotlight.\n\nAvatar: The Last Airbender\n\nA talented young cast bring to life the tale of Aang (Gordon Cormier), the latest in a long line of avatars who can control all four cardinal elements, but is frozen in time for a century when his world needed him most. Awakened by new friends Katara (Kiawentiio) and Sokka (Ian Ousley), he sets about continuing his training as the Avatar in an attempt to restore balance, all the while pursued by the relentless Prince Zuko (Dallas Liu), heir to the imperialist Fire Nation that has conquered the word. Consider this a cautious recommendation\u2014the original animated version, also on Netflix, remains superior\u2014but Netflix's live action Avatar remake serves up scale and spectacle, without betraying the heart of the classic show. It's also already confirmed for two more seasons, so viewers can look forward to the complete saga without the now-familiar Netflix cancellation worries.\n\nThe Legend of Korra\n\nIf you're still not sold on the live-action Avatar, this sequel to the original series is well worth your time. Set 70 years after the animated Avatar: The Last Airbender, The Legend of Korra explores how Aang's world has progressed after decades of relative peace. When Korra, the new Avatar, moves to Republic City to complete her training under the tutelage of Tenzin\u2014Aang's son, now with a family of his own\u2014she finds herself and new friends Mako and Bolin caught in the growing tensions between element benders and the Equalist movement, who claim the unpowered are an oppressed class. As the series progresses over its four seasons, The Legend of Korra proves itself a very different beast than its predecessor, exploring political themes and social prejudices in deeper\u2014and often darker\u2014detail, while also expanding the more fantastic elements of the universe and revealing the origins of the first Avatar. Even more brilliantly animated, and with a unique 1920s inspired aesthetic, Korra is a show that grew up alongside its audience, and is all the stronger for it.\n\nThe Gentlemen\n\nCreated by Guy Ritchie, and loosely following his 2019 film of the same name, this darkly comedic series follows Eddie Horniman (Theo James), a former British Army officer, after he inherits the family estate and title of Duke following his father's death. Oh, and the massive cannabis farm hidden beneath the grounds. Drawn into a literal criminal underground, Eddie finds himself having to deal with his family's legacy, his only real support coming from Susie (Kaya Scodelario), who's been running the drug empire. With a cast bolstered by Ray Winstone as Bobby Glass, Susie's incarcerated father and criminal kingpin, and Giancarlo Esposito as Stanley Johnston, an American investor with his own designs on the Horniman estate, The Gentlemen is a violent and blood-splattered crime caper in the heart of the British aristocracy. Consider it the antithesis of The Crown\u2014or not far removed from it, depending on your stance on the British Monarchy.\n\nGriselda\n\nCharting the life of infamous drug lord Griselda Blanco, who rose from a desperate life in Colombia to become a major player in the Miami drug wars, this dramatization shines largely thanks to a phenomenal performance from Sof\u00eda Vergara in the title role, channeling a chilling persona that makes her turn on Modern Family seem a lifetime away. While not entirely historically accurate, this limited series (co-created by Narcos' Doug Miro) weaves a mesmerizing tale of Blanco's efficiency in dominating the cocaine trade\u2014and her brutality in enforcing that control. A tight six episodes makes for a compelling, if shockingly violent, binge watch.\n\nStar Trek: Prodigy\n\nParamount+'s loss is Netflix's gain with the license rescue of this great Star Trek spinoff. Kicking off on a distant prison planet, a group of young escapees are forced to become a crew when they commandeer a lost\u2014and highly experimental\u2014Starfleet vessel. Guided by a hologram version of Star Trek: Voyager's iconic Captain Janeway (voiced by the venerable Kate Mulgrew), the untested cadets face a crash course in Federation ethics as they try to escape their former captor. While aimed at younger audiences and intended as an intro to the wider Trek universe, Prodigy packs in plenty for older Trekkies to appreciate\u2014and with the complete first season available now and another 20-episode season expected later in 2024, there's a lot to enjoy.\n\nQueer Eye\n\nThe Fab Five are back for another round of life-changing makeovers in New Orleans. With heroes including a deaf football coach who needs to step up to support his students, a Kiss superfan committed to caring for his brother, and a former nun looking for love, there's plenty to tug at the heart strings. With this season marking the last for design guru Bobby Berk, Queer Eye will doubtlessly be evolving when it returns for its already-confirmed ninth season, but for now, grab the tissues and prepare to ugly-happy-cry again.\n\nOne Day\n\nBased on David Nicholls' 2009 novel of the same name, this limited series charts the lives of Emma (Ambika Mod) and Dexter (Leo Woodall) over the course of 20 years. Starting with their graduation from Edinburgh University in 1988, each episode jumps forward one year at a time, revisiting them for a single day and exploring how their existences swirl around each other, even as fate seems to drag them apart. It's all gorgeously shot and produced, each half-hour episode a time capsule of its period, while the sizzling chemistry between the leads keeps you rooting for them even when you begin to suspect they're not meant for each other. An unexpectedly beautiful romcom.\n\nBeef\n\nEver been cut off in traffic? Ever had it happen when you\u2019re having a really bad day? Ever just wanted to take the low road, chase the person down and make them pay?! Then\u2014after a few deep breaths\u2014Beef is the show for you. It's a pressure valve for every petty grievance you\u2019ve ever suffered, following rich Amy (Ali Wong) and struggling Danny (Steven Yeun) as they escalate a road rage encounter into a vengeance-fueled quest to destroy the other. Yet Beef is more than a city-wide revenge thriller\u2014it's a biting look at how crushing modern life can be, particularly in its LA setting, where extravagant wealth brushes up against inescapable poverty and seemingly no one is truly happy. Part dramedy, part therapy, Beef is a bad example of conflict resolution but a cathartic binge watch that clearly resonates\u2014as evidenced by its growing clutch of awards, including the Golden Globe for Best Limited Series.\n\nLoudermilk\n\nSomething of a sleeper hit for years\u2014its first two seasons debuted on AT&T's now-defunct pay TV channel Audience in 2017, before its third season appeared over on Amazon\u2014all three seasons of this bleak comedy are now available on Netflix. Ron Livingston stars as Sam Loudermilk, a vitriolic former music critic and recovering alcoholic who proves almost pathologically incapable of holding his tongue when faced with life's small frustrations\u2014a personality type possibly ill-suited to leading others through addiction support groups. It's dark in places, and its central character is deliberately unlikeable, but smart writing and smarter performances shape this into something of an acerbic anti-Frasier.\n\nScott Pilgrim Takes Off\n\nAdapted from the beloved graphic novel series by Bryan Lee O'Malley, animated by one of the most exciting and dynamic studios in Japan, and voiced by the entire returning cast of director Edgar Wright's 2010 live-action adaption, Scott Pilgrim Takes Off would have been cult gold even if it was a straight retelling of its eponymous slacker's battles against lover Ramona Flowers' seven evil exes. Yet somehow, in a world devoid of surprises, this packs in killer twists from the very first episode, making for a show that's as fresh and exciting as ever. Saying anything else would ruin it\u2014just watch.\n\nSweet Home\n\nBased on the Korean webcomic by Kim Carnby and Hwang Young-chan, Sweet Home offers a very different vision of apocalyptic end times\u2014rather than pandemics, disasters, or even zombies, this posits an end of the world brought about by people's transformation into grotesque monsters, each unique and seemingly based on their deepest desires when they were human. The first season was a masterclass in claustrophobic horror, as the residents of an isolated, run-down apartment building\u2014chiefly suicidal teen Cha Hyun-soo (Song Kang), former firefighter Seo Yi-kyung (Lee Si-young), and Pyeon Sang-wook (Lee Jin-wook), who may be a brutal gangster\u2014battled for survival, while the long-awaited second season explores what remains of the wider world, delving into the true nature of both monster and man. With phenomenal effects work blending prosthetics, CGI, and even stop-motion animation for some disturbingly juddering creatures, this stands apart from the horror crowd.\n\nCastlevania: Nocturne\n\nFrance, 1792: as the French Revolution rages, citizens rise up against a parasitic ruling class\u2014but vampire hunter Richter Belmont and his magic-wielding ally Maria Renard are more concerned with what's literally bleeding the people dry. Yet conventional bloodsuckers turn out to be the least of their worries when the pair meets Annette and Edouard, who have travelled halfway around the world to warn of a coming \"Vampire Messiah\" prophesized to devour the sun\u2014let's just say the stakes have never been higher (sorry). Set centuries after the previous Castlevania animated series, this proves a perfect jumping on point while maintaining the high quality animation, tight plotting, and brilliant action that made the original such a hit.\n\nBodies\n\nFour detectives. Four time periods. Four murders? Maybe\u2014but only one body. This time-twisting thriller\u2014adapted from the comic of the same name by writer Si Spencer and artists Tula Lotay, Meghan Hetrick, Dean Ormston, and Phil Winslade\u2014hops from Victorian London to a dystopian future and back again, as the same corpse is found in the same spot in each era. The only thing stranger than the impossible crime itself is the conspiracy behind it, one that spans decades, impacting and linking every figure investigating the body. A brilliantly high-concept sci-fi crime drama, Bodies is one of the best one-and-done limited series to hit Netflix in years.\n\nPluto\n\nThink you know Astro Boy? Think again. In 2003, Naoki Urasawa (Monster, 20th Century Boys) updated original creator Osamu Tezuka's hugely influential \"The Greatest Robot on Earth\" story arc for his manga Pluto, opting for a more adult approach. The focus shifts from the heroic boy robot to grizzled cybernetic detective Gesicht as he investigates a series of murders of both humans and robots, each victim left with makeshift horns crammed into their heads. Meanwhile, Atom (Astro's Japanese name) is recast as a former peace ambassador, effectively a propaganda tool rolled out at the end of the 39th Central Asian War, still dealing with trauma from the experience. This adaptation is not only a faithful recreation of Urasawa's retelling, but is stunningly animated to a standard rarely seen in Netflix's original anime productions. With eight episodes, each around an hour long, this is as prestigious as any live-action thriller the streamer has produced, and a testament to both Tezuka and Urasawa's respective geniuses.\n\nBlue Eye Samurai\n\nIn the 17th Century, Japan enforced its \"sakoku\" isolationist foreign policy, effectively closing itself off from the world. Foreigners were few and far between\u2014so when Mizu (voiced by Maya Erskine) is born with blue eyes, nine months after her mother was assaulted by one of the four white men in the country, it marks her as an outsider, regarded as less than human. Years later, after being trained by a blind sword master and now masquerading as a man, Mizu hunts down those four men, knowing that killing them all is the only way to guarantee her vengeance. Exquisitely animated\u2014which makes its unabashed violence all the more graphic\u2014and with a phenomenal voice cast bolstered by the likes of George Takei, Brenda Song, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, and Kenneth Branagh, Blue Eye Samurai is one of the best adults-only animated series on Netflix.\n\nSex Education\n\nTalking about sex with your parents is always awkward, but for teenager Otis (Asa Butterfield) it's even worse: His mother Jean (a captivating Gillian Anderson) is a renowned sex therapist who won't stop talking about sex, leaving Otis himself ambivalent toward it. Still, something must have sunk in, and after helping a fellow student navigate a sexual conundrum, Otis finds himself almost accidentally running his own sex therapy clinic on campus. While the situations are often played for laughs, over its four seasons Sex Education thoughtfully explores intimacy, sexuality, and relationships in tender and even profound ways. With a fantastic ensemble cast including incoming Doctor Who star Ncuti Gatwa as Otis' best friend Eric and Emma Mackey as love interest Maeve, this UK-set and Welsh-filmed coming-of-age dramedy has proven itself one of Netflix's best series.\n\nLa R\u00e9volution\n\nIn a triumph of on-the-nose conceptualizing, La R\u00e9volution spins an alt-history romp in on-the-cusp-of-revolt France, where the cruel aristocracy become literal \u201cblue-bloods,\u201d thanks to a contagion that turns them into inky-veined, dandyish fiends ravenous for human flesh. A plucky reformist contessa who sympathizes with the commoners\u2019 plight\u2014first being exploited by the ruling class, and then being eaten by them\u2014allies with forces both rebel and supernatural as she tries to prevent the undead disease spreading from the elite of Versaille to the whole of France\u2019s upper crust. The melding of surprisingly great production values and a cast that\u2019s clearly enjoying themselves elevates this above your standard zombie nonsense\u2014and it\u2019s subtitled, which definitely means it\u2019s art house, right?\n\nPending Train\n\nNetflix: License one of Japan\u2019s best SF dramas in years. Also Netflix: Do nothing, literally nothing, to promote it, not even create an English subbed trailer. Which is where WIRED comes in\u2014Pending Train is a show you (and Netflix) shouldn\u2019t sleep on. When a train carriage is mysteriously transported into a post-apocalyptic future, the disparate passengers\u2019 first concern is simply survival. Between exploring their new surroundings and clashing with people from another stranded train car over scarce resources, one group\u2014including hairdresser Naoya, firefighter Yuto, and teacher Sae\u2014begins to realize that there may be a reason they\u2019ve been catapulted through time: a chance to go back and avert the disaster that ruined the world. A tense, 10-episode journey, Pending Train offers a Japanese twist on Lost, but one with tighter pacing and showrunners who actually have a clue where they want the story to go.\n\nOne Piece\n\nMark one up for persistence: After numerous anime adaptations ranging from \u201cawful\u201d to \u201cnot too bad,\u201d Netflix finally strikes gold with its live-action take on the global phenomenon One Piece. Despite fans\u2019 fears, this spectacularly captures the charm, optimism, and glorious weirdness of Eiichiro Oda\u2019s beloved manga, manifesting a fantasy world where people brandish outlandish powers and hunt for a legendary treasure in an Age of Piracy almost verbatim from the page. The perfectly cast I\u00f1aki Godoy stars as Monkey D. Luffy, would-be King of the Pirates, bringing an almost elastic innate physicality to the role that brilliantly matches the characters rubber-based stretching powers, while the crew Luffy gathers over this first season\u2014including swordsmaster Roronoa Zoro (Mackenyu), navigator and skilled thief Nami (Emily Rudd), sharpshooter Usopp (Jacob Romero Gibson), and martial artist chef Sanji (Taz Skylar)\u2014all brilliantly embody their characters. A lot could have gone wrong bringing One Piece to life, but this is a voyage well worth taking.\n\nRagnarok\n\nIf you're a fan of Norse mythology but Marvel's Thor got too goofy for you with Love and Thunder, this Norwegian fantasy drama may be more to your liking. Set in the present day, young Magne Seier (David Stakston) finds he is the reincarnation of the god of thunder just in time to take a stand against the sinister Jutul family, whose polluting factories blight his hometown of Edda. No, the show is not subtle with its references, nor its environmental message, but it's a fun reimagining of myth, especially as more members of the Norse pantheon start cropping up. Best of all, with only three six-episode seasons and an actual ending\u2014no surprise cancellations here!\u2014it's a nicely digestible binge-watch.\n\nThe Chosen One\n\nBased on the comic American Jesus by writer Mark Millar (Kick-Ass, Kingsman) and artist Peter Gross (Lucifer), The Chosen One follows 12-year-old Jodie (Bobby Luhnow), raised in Mexico by his mother Sarah (Dianna Agron). While the young boy would rather hang out with his friends, his life\u2014and potentially the world\u2014changes forever when he starts exhibiting miraculous powers, attracting dangerous attention from sinister forces. While this could have been yet another formulaic entry in Netflix's expansive library of supernatural teen dramas (the Stranger Things vibe is particularly strong), the decision to shoot on film and in a 4:3 aspect ratio make this a visual delight, unlike almost anything else on the streamer at present. There's an English dub, but stick to the original Spanish with English subs for a better viewing experience. (Confusingly, there's another show with the exact same title on Netflix, a 2019 Brazilian series following a trio of relief doctors in a village dominated by a cult leader\u2014also worth a watch, but don't get them confused!)\n\nHeartstopper\n\nArguably the most joyful show on Netflix is back for another school year of teen drama and heartfelt romance. With Charlie (Joe Locke) and Nick (Kit Connor) now officially dating, this long-awaited second season starts off with Nick struggling to come out as bisexual\u2014but it\u2019s openly-gay Charlie\u2019s parents who seem to struggle the most with their relationship. Meanwhile, Elle (Yasmin Finney) and Tao\u2019s (William Gao) will-they-won\u2019t-they saga continues to sizzle, and a school trip to Paris turns into a crucible for everyone\u2019s emotions. Although it steps into slightly darker terrain this season, the brilliant adaptation of Alice Oseman\u2019s graphic novels continues to be an utter delight\u2014the show younger LGBTQ+ viewers need now, older ones needed years ago, and that everyone needs to watch whatever your sexuality.\n\nCobra Kai\n\nWhile this latter day sequel to The Karate Kid films of the 1980s started life on YouTube Red (remember that?), it\u2019s really come into its own since moving to Netflix. Picking up decades after Daniel LaRusso and Johnny Lawrence\u2019s iconic fight at the end of the first movie, the debut season of Cobra Kai finds the tables turned, with Daniel living the charmed life while Johnny is washed up. Yet after defending his young neighbor Miguel (Xolo Maridue\u00f1a) in a fight, Johnny finds new meaning by re-opening the eponymous karate dojo and guiding a new generation of students. As the series progresses, the stakes get higher\u2014and frankly, increasingly, gloriously, ludicrous\u2014as rival martial arts schools start cropping up all over California and alliances are forged and broken with alarming regularity. It\u2019s all presented a little bit tongue-in-cheek, and with Ralph Macchio and William Zabka reprising their 1980s roles, the show is an unabashed love letter to the classic action flicks, but thanks to some seriously impressive fights and stunt work, and with a younger cast you can\u2019t help but root for, it\u2019s a retro-styled delight. With a sixth and final season in the works, now is the perfect time to binge the first five.\n\nCunk on Earth\n\nBritish comedy alert: This might not be for you. If, however, you appreciate drier-than-a-desert humor and cringe-inducingly awkward interviews, this is a must-watch. A perfectly framed lampoon of globe-trotting documentaries, Cunk on Earth sees host Philomena Cunk (in reality, comedian Diane Morgan) exploring world history, from the development of agriculture through to the space race, offering deranged insights and skewering real-world experts with incredibly stupid questions along the way. Morgan\u2019s relentlessly deadpan delivery alone makes this five-episode series worth a watch, but it\u2019s those interviews that make this comedy gold.\n\nGlitch\n\nTo those in the northern hemisphere, this Australian supernatural drama might be one of the best kept secrets of the last decade. Centred on a small town in Victoria, an entire community is shaken when seven people rise from their graves, seemingly in perfect health but with no memory of who they are or how they died. As police sergeant James Hayes (Patrick Brammall) and local doctor Elishia McKellar (Genevieve O'Reilly) try to contain and examine \u201cThe Risen,\u201d Hayes\u2019 world is rocked when he learns his own late wife Kate is among them. Over the course of three seasons and 18 episodes, the reasons for the dead\u2019s return is teased out, starting with simply \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhy,\u201d but building up to something that questions the rules of reality. A fantastic ensemble cast and brilliant pacing make this a must-see.\n\nBlack Mirror\n\nAs creator Charlie Brooker recently told WIRED, \u201cBlack Mirror wasn't meant to be \u2018this is what\u2019s going on in technology this week.\u2019 It was always designed to be a more paranoid and weird and hopefully unique show.\u201d And that it is, but rather than displaying what\u2019s going on in technology as it\u2019s happening, the show has a way of beating its viewers to the paranoid punch, addressing dystopian anxieties before they even happen. (Black Mirror was talking about AI long before your mom ever heard of ChatGPT.) There are now six seasons of Brooker's show on Netflix, and if you haven\u2019t watched, now may be the time. How else will you know what you\u2019ll be worried about five years from now?\n\nShe-Ra and the Princesses of Power\n\nOn the planet Etheria, Adora loyally serves the Horde, rising through its ranks with her close friend Catra by her side, until the discovery of a strange sword transforms her into the legendary warrior She-Ra. Learning the truth about the oppressive forces she's served her whole life, Adora joins the Rebellion against the Horde\u2014but can she really turn her back on everything she's ever known? And will Catra ever forgive the betrayal? Developed by ND Stevenson\u2014whose own Nimona delighted viewers as an animated movie on Netflix\u2014the modern She-Ra reimagines the 1980s classic, eschewing the original's connection to He-Man and episodic structure in favor of its own unique mythology and long-form storytelling, packed with complex characters, high stakes, and some powerfully emotional moments. Perfect for fans of Avatar: The Last Airbender or The Legend of Korra, this dazzlingly animated five-season action-fantasy is as compelling for older fans as it is younger viewers\u2014and some of the best LGBTQ+ representation to be found in any medium doesn't hurt either.\n\nQueen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story\n\nA prequel spinoff to Bridgerton\u2014the Shondaland-produced Regency era historical romance that continues to break Netflix viewership records\u2014Queen Charlotte takes viewers back to 1761, exploring how a young Charlotte (India Amarteifio) meets and marries George III (Corey Mylchreest). In typical Bridgerton fashion though, there\u2019s far more going on than a period love story, with the spirited Charlotte initially trying to escape the arranged marriage before learning to navigate the corridors of power\u2014and manage George\u2019s deteriorating mental health. Interspersed with scenes in Bridgerton\u2019s \u201cpresent day\u201d 1817, where the now-formidable stateswoman Queen Charlotte (a returning Golda Rosheuvel) deals with a succession crisis to the throne, this limited series is compulsory viewing for fans of the series, and a great entry point for anyone yet to be wooed by its charms.\n\nInside Man\n\nJefferson Grieff (Stanley Tucci) is a former criminology professor on death row for killing his wife, telling his story to a journalist named Beth (Lydia West). Harry Watling (David Tennant) is an unassuming English vicar, tending to his parishioners. The two men are a world apart\u2014until a horrific misunderstanding leads to Watling trapping a friend of Beth's in his basement. As Watling's situation and mental state deteriorate, Beth turns to the killer for help finding her friend. Created and written by Stephen Moffat, this tense transatlantic thriller has just a dash of The Silence of the Lambs, and with a cast at the top of their game, it\u2019s gripping viewing. Best of all, its tight four episodes mean you can binge it in one go.\n\nThe Diplomat\n\nIf there's a West Wing-shaped hole in your life, look no further than The Diplomat\u2014a tense geopolitical thriller elevated beyond the norms of the genre by a superb central performance by The Americans' Keri Russell as Kate Wyler, newly appointed US ambassador to the UK. Far from being an easy assignment in a friendly country, Kate's role coincides with an attack on a British aircraft carrier, leaving her to defuse an international crisis before it escalates into full-blown war. It's a job that might go easier if her own special relationship with husband Hal (Rufus Sewell) weren't fraying, as his resentment at being demoted leads him to interfere in her efforts. One of Netflix's biggest hits of 2023, The Diplomat has already been renewed for season two.\n\nAlice in Borderland\n\nWhen slacker Ryohei Arisu (Kento Yamazaki) is mysteriously transported to a deserted Tokyo, his keen gaming skills give him an edge navigating a series of lethal games that test intellect as much as physical prowess. Yet after barely scraping through several rounds, Arisu is no closer to uncovering the secrets of this strange borderland, or to finding a way home\u2014and the stakes are about to get even higher. Not only are Arisu and his allies Usagi (Tao Tsuchiya), Kuina (Aya Asahina), and Chishiya (Nijiro Murakami) faced with another gauntlet of sadistic games, but they find themselves caught between rival card suit \u201ccourts\u201d vying for power\u2014and not everyone can be trusted.\n\nWith its willingness to kill off main characters at a moment\u2019s notice, the first season of this gripping adaptation of Haro Aso\u2019s manga kept viewers on tenterhooks throughout. As the long-awaited second season leans further into its twisted Alice in Wonderland imagery, expect more shocking developments in this taut thriller.\n\nArcane\n\nLet's be honest: Animated series based on video games often run the gamut from cheap cash-ins to half-decent if forgettable tie-ins, inaccessible to anyone but hardcore devotees. In contrast, Arcane stands apart from the crowd by making its connections to Riot Games' League of Legends almost optional. While its central figures, orphaned sisters Vi and Jinx, are playable characters in the game, viewers don't need foreknowledge of their story to enjoy this steampunk saga of class war, civil uprising, and the people caught in between. With a gorgeous painterly art style, strong characters, and frequently shocking story beats, Arcane defies its origins to become one of the best animated series in years\u2014and it has racked up plenty of awards, including a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program, to prove it.\n\nThe Sandman\n\nThe Sandman is one of the most beloved comic series of the past 40 years. A dark fantasy about dreams, reality, stories, and the mercurial relationship between them, Neil Gaiman's books have endured as essential reading for goth teens and literati alike. While attempts to bring the saga of Dream of the Endless\u2014sometimes known as Morpheus, immortal embodiment and master of the nightlands, fierce and terrible in his wrath\u2014to the screen have been underway practically since the comic debuted in 1988, this long-in-development Netflix adaptation is worth the wait. It\u2019s a perfect translation of the first two graphic novels in the series and follows Dream (a sombre and imposing Tom Sturridge) as he restores his power and kingdom after being held in captivity for a century by occultists who snared him instead of his sister Death (Kirby Howell-Baptiste). Fittingly, the show has a dreamlike pacing to it, blurring the lines between episodic narratives and longer arcs, and it is as likely to leave viewers crying over a gargoyle\u2019s fate as it is to shock them with the sadistic actions of an escaped nightmare-turned-serial killer named the Corinthian (Boyd Holbrook). The Sandman\u2019s journey to the screen might have been the stuff of restless nights, but the result is a dream you won\u2019t want to wake up from.\n\nStranger Things\n\nNetflix's nostalgic sci-fi/horror series is back for its fourth season, set six months after the Battle of Starcourt and with its core cast separated for the first time. The Byers family and Eleven are off in California, Hopper is still (somehow) in a Russian prison, and the remaining crew are home in Hawkins, Indiana, about to face down a terrifying new threat\u2014high school. Oh, and another incursion from the horrific Upside Down. The Duffer Brothers continue to offer up plenty of 1980s nostalgia for viewers who grew up on a diet of Spielberg, Lucas, and Craven, while upping the stakes with a significant new threat. Expect drama, scares, and\u2014of course\u2014plenty of Dungeons & Dragons as the cult show roars toward its fifth and final season.\n\nRussian Doll\n\nIn Russian Doll, Nadia has one very big problem: Time keeps breaking around her. Season one finds Nadia\u2014played by Natasha Lyonne, who is also a cocreator on the show\u2014dying at her own birthday party, only to wake up there over and over again, trapped in a Groundhog Day-style loop until she can unravel her personalized knot in the space-time continuum. Things only get stranger in season two, where Nadia finds herself traveling back in time to 1982 and inhabiting the body of her own mother\u2014currently heavily pregnant with Nadia herself. Both seasons are funny and thought-provoking, reflecting on personal and generational trauma, all without overegging the potential for philosophical musing.\n\nSquid Game\n\nProduced in Korea, Squid Game blends Hunger Games and Parasite with a battle-royal-style contest. Hundreds of desperate, broke people are recruited to a contest where they can win enough money to never need to worry about their debts again. All they have to do to win the \u20a945.6 billion ($35.8 million) jackpot is complete six children\u2019s games. But it\u2019s not that simple: All the games have a twist, and very few people make it out alive. Squid Game is intense, brutal, and often very graphic, but it is also completely gripping. Netflix\u2019s dubbing isn\u2019t the best in this instance, but the nine episodes are compelling enough to make up for it.\n\nLupin\n\nArs\u00e8ne Lupin, the belle epoque burglar created by French novelist Maurice Leblanc in the early 1900s, is reinvented as Assane Diop, a first-generation Frenchman with a mania for Lupin books and a grudge against the powerful forces who decades ago framed his father for a theft he didn\u2019t commit\u2014and led him to die in prison. Pairing drones, social media bots, and hacking skills with traditional tools of the trade like fake beards, picklocks, and quick wits, Diop hunts down his adversaries as he searches for the truth about his father\u2019s fate. In his spare time, Diop also tries to patch together a crumbling marriage and build a better rapport with his son. Worth watching in the French original, this five-episode series\u2019 strength lies in the dialog, the character development, and the charismatic performance of Omar Sy as Assane. The actual escapades and daring heists are beautifully choreographed, but a lot of the mechanics\u2014how a certain piece of legerdemain worked, when an impenetrable building was infiltrated\u2014are left to the viewer's imagination.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast', 'Matt Kamen', 'Wired Staff', 'Jennifer M.

{"title": "Stock Trader Answers Stock Market Questions From Twitter", "text": "Transcript\n\nI'm Stock Trader Lance Breitstein.\n\nLet's answer some questions from the internet.\n\nThis is Stock Market Support.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\n@_Konqueror_Khan asks,\n\nAs a trader, what is your response to the question,\n\nwhat do you do for a living?\n\nAs cliche as it is,\n\nwe're always trying to buy low and sell high.\n\nThe market, especially when there's breaking news,\n\ncan move so, so, so, so fast,\n\nand there's no room for hesitation.\n\nIf a headline comes out,\n\ncompany A is in talks to buy company B,\n\nthat company B's share price will shoot up within seconds.\n\nSo as a day trader, it's my job to try\n\nand process that headline as quick as I can.\n\nThen if I think it's gonna be positive for stock B,\n\nI wanna buy that stock as quickly as possible,\n\nand all of this elapses in a matter of seconds.\n\n@Vivek_Investor asks, When to sell a stock?\n\nA million dollar question, right?\n\nAnswer: when people who are not familiar with the markets\n\nare talking about the specific stock.\n\nWell, Vivek, I actually think you have\n\na really great point there.\n\nAs a trader, we often want to be placing our bets\n\nbefore the euphoria,\n\nbefore people are super, super excited,\n\nand so often tops in a stock really do align\n\nwhen investor sentiment just gets too hot.\n\nWhen is the worst time to sell?\n\nGenerally, the worst time to sell is going to be\n\nwhen stock prices are falling so, so, so, so quick,\n\nand you feel that panic in your stomach,\n\nand all your friends are scared.\n\nIn those times of panic,\n\nyou really wanna follow Warren Buffett's advice\n\nand do the opposite.\n\nAs they say, when there's blood in the streets,\n\nthat's when you want to be buying stocks.\n\n@TheFinancePilot asks,\n\nDoes the stock market feel like a casino to you?\n\nIf you were to pick 10 random stocks for me to trade,\n\nthat would be like taking me to a casino,\n\nand sitting me down\n\nat a random slot machine. [machine beeping]\n\nOver the long run, I will lose.\n\nBut if I am able to pick the specific tickers,\n\nthen all of a sudden, rather than sitting at a slot machine,\n\nit's like me sitting at the poker table,\n\nand sometimes at that poker table,\n\nit might happen that I get Pocket Aces,\n\nand while I might get Pocket Aces,\n\nI can never guarantee the outcome of that hand,\n\nbut what it does allow me to do\n\nis occasionally stack the odds in my favor\n\nso that if I bet properly and play my hand right,\n\nin the long run,\n\nit allows me the chance of beating the market.\n\n@Abhishekkar_ asks,\n\nWhy do big traders use so many screens?\n\nIf you've ever seen a picture of a trading floor,\n\nyou know that this is absolutely true.\n\nI myself used six screens for my trading.\n\nWhy do we do this?\n\nIt's because we need to be glued in\n\nand queued into so many different things.\n\nSo on this top left here, you'll see my watch list.\n\nThat will be a list of all the stock tickers\n\nthat I'm looking at that day.\n\nEvery trader has their watch list.\n\nAs part of their preparation for the day,\n\nthey decide what stocks they wanna look at\n\nso that they're really queued in\n\nto how their prices are changing over time.\n\nRight here, that box is the live news.\n\nIt feeds in all the news headlines\n\non a specific stock ticker,\n\nand a lot of that news happens through a Bloomberg terminal.\n\nA Bloomberg terminal and the keyboard is\n\none of the critical pieces of hardware\n\nthat you'll see on a trader's desk.\n\nAll of these color-coded keys really help you interface\n\nwith the Bloomberg software.\n\nIt really comes down to speed and precision,\n\nso that traders can do exactly what they need to do\n\nas quickly as possible.\n\nRight here, we have the Level 2 box.\n\nOn the left, you have all the bids.\n\nThe bids are anybody out there in the world\n\nthat wants to buy that specific stock.\n\nYou can even see the price.\n\nThen on the right side is the ask.\n\nThe ask is the price and size\n\nof every single person out there\n\nthat's looking to sell the stock.\n\nWhen you have the price intersect,\n\nthat's when a transaction occurs.\n\nWhen we look at this stock chart,\n\nthere's a whole lot more to it.\n\nIn fact, there's a whole science essentially of trading,\n\nand that subject is called technical analysis.\n\n@cookiecokss wants to know, What is technical analysis?\n\nTechnical analysis is a really big word\n\nfor essentially the essence of day trading.\n\nWhat we have here is a chart of Tesla.\n\nThis is just Tesla's stock price over time.\n\nThe bars will be green when the price goes up,\n\nthe bars will be red when the price goes down.\n\nAnd so when we look at this specific chart,\n\nthere's a couple things we notice.\n\nFirst, overall, this is what I would call a strong stock.\n\nStock prices are going up and towards the right,\n\nwhich means it's increasing in price.\n\nWe see a little bit of a volume spike around noon,\n\nand then the price spiked as well.\n\nThe most volume tends to occur either at the open\n\nor the close for most stocks.\n\nSo that tells me that something atypical happened there.\n\nI suspect it's very likely that a piece of news occurred\n\nthat drove that price higher,\n\nand increased all the transactions\n\nin the stock at that time.\n\nAnother thing this chart tells me is\n\nwe spent pretty much the whole day above that yellow line,\n\nthe volume-weighted average price,\n\nor VWAP, as us traders like to call it.\n\nIt takes every single transaction\n\nthat occurred in the stock,\n\nit multiplies it by the price,\n\nand you get essentially the average price\n\nbased on the volume that occurred there.\n\nA lot of traders like to think that\n\nif a stock is trading above that VWAP line,\n\nthat's a bullish signal.\n\nIn other words, we suspect that\n\nthe trend might continue higher.\n\nIf a stock is trading below VWAP,\n\nwe take that as a bear signal.\n\nIn other words, we interpret that\n\nas the stock might continue to head lower.\n\n@pmckeough asks,\n\nWhat factors make a stock a good buy in your opinion?\n\nFor the most part,\n\nyou really want to invest for a long horizon,\n\nbecause, over time, the stock market does tend to go up.\n\nHowever, as a trader, we take a much different approach.\n\nAs a day trader, I really want to stick to stocks in play.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nI wanna be trading the stocks with the most volatility,\n\nthe biggest changes in sentiment.\n\nI wanna be trading the AMCs and the GameStops\n\nwhen they're going crazy.\n\nI wanna trade the Reddit IPO.\n\nSo what happens if a stock doesn't move?\n\nTraders can't make money.\n\nSo you can bet that we're really looking for the excitement\n\nand the big moves to make the big money.\n\n@FrostAceReal wants to know,\n\nWhy the [beep] are people buying into GameStop\n\nall of a sudden?\n\nWhy do you want to invest in mid?\n\nAll these meme stocks are amazing opportunities to trade\n\nand make short-term bets\n\nas long as you have the experience\n\nto end up on the right side of it.\n\nSo many people are aware of the GameStop phenomenon,\n\nand the whole movement of so-called meme stocks.\n\nA meme stock is a stock\n\nwhere its price is largely influenced by the whims\n\nof social media and different memes online.\n\nMany might even be familiar with what happened in 2021\n\nwith Keith Gill, a.k.a. @theroaringkitty,\n\nwho is a financial analyst\n\nthat really came to have the belief\n\nthat GameStop shares were undervalued,\n\nand he almost created somewhat of a populist movement\n\nwhere people wanted to buy GameStop,\n\nwhere a lot of large hedge funds and institutions\n\nwere betting against the stock price performance.\n\nIt became this calling of sticking it to the trader man,\n\nand sending that stock to the moon.\n\nIt happened again recently as @theroaringkitty\n\ncame out on Twitter for the first time in years\n\nand tweeted a meme.\n\nAnd GameStop went from $10\n\nto as high as $80 pre-market one day\n\nas a result of that tweet alone.\n\nYou might have heard of friends or coworkers\n\nthat have made money with bets on GameStop or AMC.\n\nWhat we say in stock world is what rises really fast\n\nso often comes crashing down just as fast,\n\nand we saw GameStop tumbling down back to $20.\n\nSo if you're investing in making some of these trades,\n\nyou can lose 100% of your capital very, very quickly.\n\nI highly advise against doing any of those crazy bets\n\nunless you are a skilled trader.\n\n@jtedscott wants to know,\n\nWhy did they choose bear and bull to describe the market?\n\nWhy not bull and scaredy cat,\n\nor bull and chicken?\n\nAs you can see, this good old bull on my desk here,\n\nthe way a bull strikes is it strikes upwards.\n\nAnd a bull market is used to refer to a stock market\n\nwhen prices rise by 20% or more.\n\nOn the other side, though, a bear strikes downwards,\n\nand by technical definition,\n\na bear market is when prices fall from the highs\n\nby 20% or more.\n\nAn example of a bear market is what we saw\n\nduring the Great Recession in 2008,\n\nand even what we saw during the early stages of COVID\n\nin spring 2020 when markets fell precipitously\n\nto try and price in the risk of COVID spreading\n\naround the world.\n\n@Fly_Bry wants to know,\n\nWhat is the Warren Buffet secret to success?\n\nI think many people have heard of Warren Buffett,\n\nand it's because he really has one of the best track records\n\nof investing of all time.\n\nHe has invested through every market cycle imaginable,\n\nevery boom, every bust.\n\nThat knowledge and the hours he spends\n\npouring over financial statements allows him\n\nto have an informational and a psychological advantage\n\nover the rest of the market.\n\nIt's the average person out there\n\nwho wants to follow Warren Buffett-style investing advice.\n\nIndex funds are often the way to go.\n\nYou want to invest for the long run,\n\nyou want to buy more when others are fearful,\n\nand you wanna have the long-time horizon,\n\nand capture the growth and success\n\nof the American economy as a whole.\n\n@Mitesh_Engr asks,\n\nWhat is the driving force for a stock to move?\n\nThe stock price and what causes it to move\n\nis simply whatever people are willing\n\nto buy and sell a stock for.\n\nWhat people need to realize is\n\nso often stock prices don't reflect the true economy,\n\nbut perceptions of where the future economy is going to go.\n\nLet's take a case study.\n\nEveryone out there has heard about this huge AI boom.\n\nSo who will be some of the beneficiaries from this AI boom?\n\nOne of them is Nvidia, which is making a lot of these chips.\n\nSo if you were to look at the share price of Nvidia,\n\nyou're going to see that over the last couple years,\n\nit has just absolutely exploded.\n\nThey're creating so many of the chips\n\nthat powers this AI boom.\n\nA lot of investors want to participate in what they view\n\nto be the future of growth and innovation.\n\nHow many chips will they sell?\n\nWhat will the profit margins for this company be?\n\nAnd what are we willing to pay for it today\n\nto compensate for those unknowns?\n\nThat is what the stock market really does.\n\n@vivbajaj asks, Do you trade stocks based on news?\n\nYes, yes, and yes.\n\nPart of our job as traders is to figure out\n\nwhat are the implications of that news,\n\nand then what does it do to the stock price?\n\nAt the start of the war in Ukraine,\n\nwe saw investors rightfully start to panic\n\ndue to the increased geopolitical risk.\n\nOn one of those days, Tesla sold off\n\nalong with the rest of the stock market.\n\nBut then what happened is, later in the day,\n\nwhen some of the fears settled,\n\npeople started to buy Tesla on the second implication,\n\nwhich is, if oil prices shoot higher,\n\nwhat might the implications be\n\nfor electric vehicle adoption over time,\n\nand the prospects of Tesla as a company.\n\n@AngeloTerzo2 wants to know,\n\nIs the trend really your friend?\n\nI would say a resounding yes.\n\nIt is so, so, so important to stay with the trend.\n\nOne way that I like to illustrate this point is\n\nwhat I like to call the right side of the V.\n\nEven though A and B are at the same price,\n\nI wanna be on the right side of the V,\n\nbecause this green line is a stock price\n\ngoing down, down, down, down, down,\n\nand at point A, when we're at $50, you still don't know\n\nhow far that stock might still have to fall.\n\nFor all we know, it could go to 40 or 30 or 20.\n\nThat's why it's so much better to buy\n\nat the right side of the V, when you're with the trend.\n\nThat tends to have higher expected value,\n\nbecause now that we're with the trend,\n\nand these trends tend to continue,\n\nthat puts the odds much more in our favor,\n\nand it's a safer way to invest or trade.\n\n@mattryanx wants to know,\n\nOkay, wait, a real stock market question:\n\nhow does the stock of a company in any way actually impact\n\nthe company and its well-being?\n\nWhen a stock goes public for the first time,\n\nthat's called the IPO, or initial public offering.\n\nSo whatever that IPO price is at,\n\nthat's actually the proceeds that the company will get.\n\nSo if the company were to sell 1,000 shares at a $100,\n\nthey would be raising 100,000 bucks.\n\nBut if that stock then went up way, way higher\n\nafter that IPO,\n\nthey actually wouldn't directly benefit from that.\n\nWhile the day-to-day price of the stock\n\ndoesn't directly influence a company,\n\na lot of the shareholders might own some of the stock.\n\nSo this can have implications for morale,\n\nand also just corporate funding decisions\n\nlike whether to raise money through debt,\n\nessentially issue bonds,\n\nor raise money through equity by selling stock.\n\n@Rushabh_Midas asks, Why top stocks are called blue chip?\n\nThe term blue chips comes from the fact\n\nthat back in the day when people were playing poker,\n\nthe most expensive chips were the blue chips.\n\nThat term was then adapted to refer to stocks\n\nthat were some of the biggest, most profitable, stable,\n\nand respected companies in the economy.\n\nIn the US, we traditionally refer to blue chip stocks\n\nlike GE, or Ford, or General Motors,\n\nbut nowadays it's a different guard\n\nmade up of companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia.\n\n@_marfii wants to know,\n\nSo I'm rewatching 'The Wolf of Wall Street',\n\nany economics nerds on here know\n\nhow accurate it actually is?\n\nIt's definitely a classic.\n\nThat is the true story of Jordan Belfort.\n\nWhat he was a part of is\n\nwhat's called a pump-and-dump scheme.\n\nPeople back then, and still to some degree today,\n\nbuy stocks for themselves and their company,\n\nthen try to pump the stock price up,\n\npromote the stock, and push up the price,\n\nand make a lot of exaggerations to potential investors\n\nthat will get them to buy the stock\n\nat a much higher price than you bought it for.\n\nCreating all this excitement and almost false narrative\n\nto suck people in to buying the stock that you have\n\nwith a huge conflict of interest\n\nin that you're often selling it to them\n\nat a higher price.\n\n@keepkwizing wants to know,\n\nWhat are some stocks that can give 1,000% returns\n\nin the next three years?\n\nA lot of people in the stock market world,\n\nespecially with Instagram and TikTok,\n\nthey're going to promise you things\n\nthat are totally, totally impossible.\n\nMuch like poker, this is a probabilistic game.\n\nI can identify situations that are in my favor,\n\nbut never ever would I be able\n\nto promise anyone anything like,\n\noh, this stock will return 100%,\n\nor let alone 1,000% in a couple years.\n\nAnybody that's making these dramaticized claims,\n\na lot of that is not only not true,\n\nbut some of it might even be illegal.\n\n@chefboyardeej_ asks, How does the stock market crash?\n\nJust uncrash it?\n\nIf only it were that easy.\n\nBut as to why the stock market crashes,\n\nit's because sometimes there's sudden events\n\nthat results in this feedback loop\n\nwhere so many people wanna go for the exit all at once.\n\nWe have an expression in trader world,\n\nit's okay to panic as long as you're gonna be\n\nthe first person out the door.\n\nBut if everybody's already exited,\n\nand prices have dropped precipitously,\n\nthen it's just too late,\n\nand you often are better off sitting tight.\n\nOne example of probably the biggest stock market crash is\n\nin October 19th, 1987, Black Monday.\n\nThe stock market fell a whopping 22% in a single day.\n\nThat is almost unfathomable for me to imagine.\n\n@VoltBoltTrade wants to know,\n\nWhat can emotional trading or psychological pressure\n\ndo to your trading in the financial market?\n\nThe reality of being a trader is that\n\nit is one of the most emotionally\n\nand psychologically challenging jobs out there.\n\nSo often the average layman will be selling\n\nduring the panics when we wanna be buying.\n\nSo what a pro trader does is\n\nwe override those base-level emotions,\n\nand we try to buy when people panic,\n\nand then sell when people get euphoric.\n\nHere's a scene from Billions I really love\n\nthat portrays this topic well.\n\nYou've got to be able to withstand the pressure\n\nor it'll crush you.\n\nHere in this scene, he's saying,\n\nI don't lie to myself. I don't lie to myself.\n\nI don't hold onto a loser. I don't hold onto a loser.\n\nI let it go, get away from it.\n\nIf you have years or decades of experience,\n\nyour intuition is actually giving you very useful knowledge,\n\ntelling you that something is not acting right.\n\nAnd when that happens,\n\nI try to always listen to my intuition.\n\n@slimmerella_ says, Imma be real for a sec.\n\nI have absolutely no idea\n\nhow the New York Stock Exchange works.\n\nLike I don't get why everyone is just running around\n\nyelling in earpieces.\n\nI just feel like there's a more calm way\n\nwe can tackle this?\n\nI totally agree, @slimmerella_,\n\nand a lot of that craziness, and the running around,\n\nand the screaming and yelling has actually gone\n\nthe way of the past.\n\nYes, some floor trading does still exist.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange still has their floor,\n\nand their different areas for some of the different stocks,\n\nbut the overwhelming majority of stock trading is all done\n\nthrough electronic trading using software and the internet.\n\nThat being said, it is true that\n\nwhen you see those people yelling and screaming,\n\na lot of those people are taking in orders,\n\nsome still by phone even,\n\nand they're trying to process them through the system\n\nto eventually find the best way to place them in the market,\n\nand get the best pricing for their client.\n\n@PerceptivTrader asks,\n\nWhat sets apart pro traders from amateurs?\n\nThe difference between elite and amateur is massive.\n\nA lot of what a trader succeeds at is pattern recognition.\n\nThe more experience you have,\n\nyou can notice all these nuances\n\nthat an amateur doesn't stand a chance at noticing.\n\nThe same way that Tom Brady can read a defense,\n\nand know where people are going to move before they do it.\n\nIt's that difference versus being a high school quarterback.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nInvesting always involves risk,\n\nso do your own research or consult a financial advisor\n\nbefore making any investment decisions.\n\nThanks for watching Stock Market Support.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image": "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill,d_placeholder_wired.png,fl_progressive,g_face,h_1080,q_80,w_1920/v1719251886/wired_tech-support-stock-trader-answers-stock-market-questions-from-twitter.jpg", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.wired.com/video/watch/tech-support-stock-trader-answers-stock-market-questions-from-twitter", "timestamp": "1719366045.261278", "displayed": 0}
{"title": "Stock Trader Answers Stock Market Questions From Twitter", "text": "Transcript\n\nI'm Stock Trader Lance Breitstein.\n\nLet's answer some questions from the internet.\n\nThis is Stock Market Support.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\n@_Konqueror_Khan asks,\n\nAs a trader, what is your response to the question,\n\nwhat do you do for a living?\n\nAs cliche as it is,\n\nwe're always trying to buy low and sell high.\n\nThe market, especially when there's breaking news,\n\ncan move so, so, so, so fast,\n\nand there's no room for hesitation.\n\nIf a headline comes out,\n\ncompany A is in talks to buy company B,\n\nthat company B's share price will shoot up within seconds.\n\nSo as a day trader, it's my job to try\n\nand process that headline as quick as I can.\n\nThen if I think it's gonna be positive for stock B,\n\nI wanna buy that stock as quickly as possible,\n\nand all of this elapses in a matter of seconds.\n\n@Vivek_Investor asks, When to sell a stock?\n\nA million dollar question, right?\n\nAnswer: when people who are not familiar with the markets\n\nare talking about the specific stock.\n\nWell, Vivek, I actually think you have\n\na really great point there.\n\nAs a trader, we often want to be placing our bets\n\nbefore the euphoria,\n\nbefore people are super, super excited,\n\nand so often tops in a stock really do align\n\nwhen investor sentiment just gets too hot.\n\nWhen is the worst time to sell?\n\nGenerally, the worst time to sell is going to be\n\nwhen stock prices are falling so, so, so, so quick,\n\nand you feel that panic in your stomach,\n\nand all your friends are scared.\n\nIn those times of panic,\n\nyou really wanna follow Warren Buffett's advice\n\nand do the opposite.\n\nAs they say, when there's blood in the streets,\n\nthat's when you want to be buying stocks.\n\n@TheFinancePilot asks,\n\nDoes the stock market feel like a casino to you?\n\nIf you were to pick 10 random stocks for me to trade,\n\nthat would be like taking me to a casino,\n\nand sitting me down\n\nat a random slot machine. [machine beeping]\n\nOver the long run, I will lose.\n\nBut if I am able to pick the specific tickers,\n\nthen all of a sudden, rather than sitting at a slot machine,\n\nit's like me sitting at the poker table,\n\nand sometimes at that poker table,\n\nit might happen that I get Pocket Aces,\n\nand while I might get Pocket Aces,\n\nI can never guarantee the outcome of that hand,\n\nbut what it does allow me to do\n\nis occasionally stack the odds in my favor\n\nso that if I bet properly and play my hand right,\n\nin the long run,\n\nit allows me the chance of beating the market.\n\n@Abhishekkar_ asks,\n\nWhy do big traders use so many screens?\n\nIf you've ever seen a picture of a trading floor,\n\nyou know that this is absolutely true.\n\nI myself used six screens for my trading.\n\nWhy do we do this?\n\nIt's because we need to be glued in\n\nand queued into so many different things.\n\nSo on this top left here, you'll see my watch list.\n\nThat will be a list of all the stock tickers\n\nthat I'm looking at that day.\n\nEvery trader has their watch list.\n\nAs part of their preparation for the day,\n\nthey decide what stocks they wanna look at\n\nso that they're really queued in\n\nto how their prices are changing over time.\n\nRight here, that box is the live news.\n\nIt feeds in all the news headlines\n\non a specific stock ticker,\n\nand a lot of that news happens through a Bloomberg terminal.\n\nA Bloomberg terminal and the keyboard is\n\none of the critical pieces of hardware\n\nthat you'll see on a trader's desk.\n\nAll of these color-coded keys really help you interface\n\nwith the Bloomberg software.\n\nIt really comes down to speed and precision,\n\nso that traders can do exactly what they need to do\n\nas quickly as possible.\n\nRight here, we have the Level 2 box.\n\nOn the left, you have all the bids.\n\nThe bids are anybody out there in the world\n\nthat wants to buy that specific stock.\n\nYou can even see the price.\n\nThen on the right side is the ask.\n\nThe ask is the price and size\n\nof every single person out there\n\nthat's looking to sell the stock.\n\nWhen you have the price intersect,\n\nthat's when a transaction occurs.\n\nWhen we look at this stock chart,\n\nthere's a whole lot more to it.\n\nIn fact, there's a whole science essentially of trading,\n\nand that subject is called technical analysis.\n\n@cookiecokss wants to know, What is technical analysis?\n\nTechnical analysis is a really big word\n\nfor essentially the essence of day trading.\n\nWhat we have here is a chart of Tesla.\n\nThis is just Tesla's stock price over time.\n\nThe bars will be green when the price goes up,\n\nthe bars will be red when the price goes down.\n\nAnd so when we look at this specific chart,\n\nthere's a couple things we notice.\n\nFirst, overall, this is what I would call a strong stock.\n\nStock prices are going up and towards the right,\n\nwhich means it's increasing in price.\n\nWe see a little bit of a volume spike around noon,\n\nand then the price spiked as well.\n\nThe most volume tends to occur either at the open\n\nor the close for most stocks.\n\nSo that tells me that something atypical happened there.\n\nI suspect it's very likely that a piece of news occurred\n\nthat drove that price higher,\n\nand increased all the transactions\n\nin the stock at that time.\n\nAnother thing this chart tells me is\n\nwe spent pretty much the whole day above that yellow line,\n\nthe volume-weighted average price,\n\nor VWAP, as us traders like to call it.\n\nIt takes every single transaction\n\nthat occurred in the stock,\n\nit multiplies it by the price,\n\nand you get essentially the average price\n\nbased on the volume that occurred there.\n\nA lot of traders like to think that\n\nif a stock is trading above that VWAP line,\n\nthat's a bullish signal.\n\nIn other words, we suspect that\n\nthe trend might continue higher.\n\nIf a stock is trading below VWAP,\n\nwe take that as a bear signal.\n\nIn other words, we interpret that\n\nas the stock might continue to head lower.\n\n@pmckeough asks,\n\nWhat factors make a stock a good buy in your opinion?\n\nFor the most part,\n\nyou really want to invest for a long horizon,\n\nbecause, over time, the stock market does tend to go up.\n\nHowever, as a trader, we take a much different approach.\n\nAs a day trader, I really want to stick to stocks in play.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nI wanna be trading the stocks with the most volatility,\n\nthe biggest changes in sentiment.\n\nI wanna be trading the AMCs and the GameStops\n\nwhen they're going crazy.\n\nI wanna trade the Reddit IPO.\n\nSo what happens if a stock doesn't move?\n\nTraders can't make money.\n\nSo you can bet that we're really looking for the excitement\n\nand the big moves to make the big money.\n\n@FrostAceReal wants to know,\n\nWhy the [beep] are people buying into GameStop\n\nall of a sudden?\n\nWhy do you want to invest in mid?\n\nAll these meme stocks are amazing opportunities to trade\n\nand make short-term bets\n\nas long as you have the experience\n\nto end up on the right side of it.\n\nSo many people are aware of the GameStop phenomenon,\n\nand the whole movement of so-called meme stocks.\n\nA meme stock is a stock\n\nwhere its price is largely influenced by the whims\n\nof social

@theroaringkitty\n\ncame out on Twitter for the first time in years\n\nand tweeted a meme.\n\nAnd GameStop went from $10\n\nto as high as $80 pre-market one day\n\nas a result of that tweet alone.\n\nYou might have heard of friends or coworkers\n\nthat have made money with bets on GameStop or AMC.\n\nWhat we say in stock world is what rises really fast\n\nso often comes crashing down just as fast,\n\nand we saw GameStop tumbling down back to $20.\n\nSo if you're investing in making some of these trades,\n\nyou can lose 100% of your capital very, very quickly.\n\nI highly advise against doing any of those crazy bets\n\nunless you are a skilled trader.\n\n@jtedscott wants to know,\n\nWhy did they choose bear and bull to describe the market?\n\nWhy not bull and scaredy

of where the future economy is going to go.\n\nLet's take a case study.\n\nEveryone out there has heard about this huge AI boom.\n\nSo who will be some of the beneficiaries from this AI boom?\n\nOne of them is Nvidia, which is making a lot of these chips.\n\nSo if you were to look at the share price of Nvidia,\n\nyou're going to see that over the last couple years,\n\nit has just absolutely

company and its well-being?\n\nWhen a stock goes public for the first time,\n\nthat's called the IPO, or initial public offering.\n\nSo whatever that IPO price is at,\n\nthat's actually the proceeds that the company will get.\n\nSo if the company were to sell 1,000 shares at a $100,\n\nthey would be raising 100,000 bucks.\n\nBut if that stock then went up way, way higher\n\nafter that IPO,\n\nthey actually wouldn't directly benefit from that.\n\nWhile the day-to-day price of the stock\n\ndoesn't directly influence a company,\n\na lot of the shareholders might own some of the stock.\n\nSo this can have implications for morale,\n\nand also just corporate funding decisions\n\nlike whether to raise money through debt,\n\nessentially issue bonds,\n\nor raise money through equity by selling stock.\n\n@Rushabh_Midas asks, Why top stocks are called blue chip?\n\nThe term blue chips comes from the fact\n\nthat back in the day when people were playing poker,\n\nthe most expensive chips were the blue chips.\n\nThat term was then adapted to refer to stocks\n\nthat were some of the biggest, most profitable, stable,\n\nand respected companies in the economy.\n\nIn the US, we traditionally refer to blue chip stocks\n\nlike GE, or Ford, or General Motors,\n\nbut nowadays it's a different guard\n\nmade up of companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia.\n\n@_marfii wants to know,\n\nSo I'm rewatching 'The Wolf of Wall Street',\n\nany economics nerds on here know\n\nhow accurate it actually is?\n\nIt's definitely a classic.\n\nThat is the true story of Jordan Belfort.\n\nWhat he was a part of is\n\nwhat's called a pump-and-dump scheme.\n\nPeople back then, and still to some degree today,\n\nbuy stocks for themselves and their company,\n\nthen try to pump the stock price up,\n\npromote the stock, and push up the price,\n\nand make a lot of exaggerations to potential investors\n\nthat will get them to buy the stock\n\nat a much higher price than you bought it for.\n\nCreating all this excitement and almost false narrative\n\nto suck people in to buying the stock that you have\n\nwith a huge conflict of interest\n\nin that you're often selling it to them\n\nat a higher price.\n\n@keepkwizing wants to know,\n\nWhat are some stocks that can give 1,000% returns\n\nin the next three years?\n\nA lot of people in the stock market world,\n\nespecially with Instagram and TikTok,\n\nthey're going to promise you things\n\nthat are totally, totally impossible.\n\nMuch like poker, this is a probabilistic game.\n\nI can identify situations that are in my favor,\n\nbut never ever would I be able\n\nto promise anyone anything like,\n\noh, this stock will return 100%,\n\nor let alone 1,000% in a couple years.\n\nAnybody that's making these dramaticized claims,\n\na lot of that is not only not true,\n\nbut some of it might even be illegal.\n\n@chefboyardeej_ asks, How does the stock market crash?\n\nJust uncrash it?\n\nIf only it were that easy.\n\nBut as to why the stock market crashes,\n\nit's because sometimes there's sudden events\n\nthat results in this feedback loop\n\nwhere so many people wanna go for the exit all at once.\n\nWe have an expression in trader world,\n\nit's okay to panic as long as you're gonna be\n\nthe first person out the door.\n\nBut if everybody's already exited,\n\nand prices have dropped precipitously,\n\nthen it's just too late,\n\nand you often are better off sitting tight.\n\nOne example of probably the biggest stock market crash is\n\nin October 19th, 1987, Black Monday.\n\nThe stock market fell a whopping 22% in a single day.\n\nThat is almost unfathomable for me to imagine.\n\n@VoltBoltTrade wants to know,\n\nWhat can emotional trading or psychological pressure\n\ndo to your trading in the financial market?\n\nThe reality of being a trader is that\n\nit is one of the most emotionally\n\nand psychologically challenging jobs out there.\n\nSo often the average layman will be selling\n\nduring the panics when we wanna be buying.\n\nSo what a pro trader does is\n\nwe override those base-level emotions,\n\nand we try to buy when people panic,\n\nand then sell when people get euphoric.\n\nHere's a scene from Billions I really love\n\nthat portrays this topic well.\n\nYou've got to be able to withstand the pressure\n\nor it'll crush you.\n\nHere in this scene, he's saying,\n\nI don't lie to myself. I don't lie to myself.\n\nI don't hold onto a loser. I don't hold onto a loser.\n\nI let it go, get away from it.\n\nIf you have years or decades of experience,\n\nyour intuition is actually giving you very useful knowledge,\n\ntelling you that something is not acting right.\n\nAnd when that happens,\n\nI try to always listen to my intuition.\n\n@slimmerella_ says, Imma be real for a sec.\n\nI have absolutely no idea\n\nhow the New York Stock Exchange works.\n\nLike I don't get why everyone is just running around\n\nyelling in earpieces.\n\nI just feel like there's a more calm way\n\nwe can tackle this?\n\nI totally agree, @slimmerella_,\n\nand a lot of that craziness, and the running around,\n\nand the screaming and yelling has actually gone\n\nthe way of the past.\n\nYes, some floor trading does still exist.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange still has their floor,\n\nand their different areas for some of the different stocks,\n\nbut the overwhelming majority of stock trading is all done\n\nthrough electronic trading using software and the internet.\n\nThat being said, it is true that\n\nwhen you see those people yelling and screaming,\n\na lot of those people are taking in orders,\n\nsome still by phone even,\n\nand they're trying to process them through the system\n\nto eventually find the best way to place them in the market,\n\nand get the best pricing for their client.\n\n@PerceptivTrader asks,\n\nWhat sets apart pro traders from amateurs?\n\nThe difference between elite and amateur is massive.\n\nA lot of what a trader succeeds at is pattern recognition.\n\nThe more experience you have,\n\nyou can notice all these nuances\n\nthat an amateur doesn't stand a chance at noticing.\n\nThe same way that Tom Brady can read a defense,\n\nand know where people are going to move before they do it.\n\nIt's that difference versus being a high school quarterback.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nInvesting always involves risk,\n\nso do your own research or consult a financial advisor\n\nbefore making any investment decisions.\n\nThanks for watching Stock Market Support.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image": "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill,d_placeholder_wired.png,fl_progressive,g_face,h_1080,q_80,w_1920/v1719251886/wired_tech-support-stock-trader-answers-stock-market-questions-from-twitter.jpg", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.wired.com/video/watch/tech-support-stock-trader-answers-stock-market-questions-from-twitter", "timestamp": "1719366046.227298", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "Medievalist Professor Answers Medieval Questions From Twitter", "text": "Transcript\n\nI'm medievalist professor Dorsey Armstrong.\n\nLet's take some questions from the internet.\n\nThis is Medieval Support.\n\n[industrial music]\n\n@JohnnyV45385760 asks,\n\nWhat did medieval English sound like?\n\nA good shorthand way\n\nto figure out what medieval English sounds like\n\nis to take all vowels\n\nand pronounce them as you would in French,\n\nand pronounce every letter.\n\nThe word for wife would be pronounced weef.\n\nThe word for house would be pronounced hus.\n\nThe word knight, k'nigt.\n\nHere is what the Lord's Prayer would've sounded like\n\nin Middle English, probably sometime in the 14th century.\n\nOor father that art in have-nuss,\n\nhallow-ed bay thee nam-eh.\n\nThee ray-um oor kingdom come to bay\n\nand led us not into temp-tass-ee-one,\n\nbut deliver us from ay-vil.\n\n@caffeinateddayes asks, why was it called the Middle Ages?\n\nHow did they know when the end was?\n\nThe name Middle Ages was given to that period\n\nby people who came much later\n\nand the middle that they were thinking of\n\nwas the period roughly from about 500 to 1500,\n\nafter the fall of the Roman Empire\n\nand before the Renaissance.\n\nAround 1000, there is an increase in population,\n\nand so we call this period in between\n\nsay, about 1000 and 1300, the High Middle Ages.\n\nThis is when the university system comes into existence.\n\nThis is when those beautiful cathedrals are all being built.\n\nIt really is a golden age in the medieval period.\n\n@B4wekiss asks, wait?!\n\nThe Game of Thrones Red Wedding really happened?\n\nIt's well known that George R.R. Martin borrowed liberally\n\nfrom medieval history.\n\nThe Red Wedding itself is based on Scottish history.\n\nIn 1440, the young King of Scotland\n\ninvited the young leaders of the Douglas clan\n\nto dine with him.\n\nWhen you're invited into the feast hall,\n\nyou dine with the king.\n\nThe code of hospitality should maintain\n\nthat no Ill can come to you,\n\nand instead they were betrayed and beheaded.\n\nLike in Game of Thrones,\n\nmuch of the contest over the throne\n\nhas to do with rival factions\n\nthat maybe to some degree or another\n\nare related to one another.\n\nGeorge R.R. Martin took as his template for this\n\nthe late medieval conflict known as the Wars of the Roses.\n\nYou have the Lancaster cousins against the York cousins.\n\nAnd in the show, the Lannisters have a name\n\nthat sounds very much like Lancaster,\n\nand the Starks, with their one syllable name,\n\nthat name chimes nicely with York.\n\nAs far as characters go, the mad Targaryen king\n\nwould seem to be a pretty clear analog\n\nto King Henry VI, who suffered bouts of madness.\n\nCercei Lannister very much resembles Margaret of Anjou,\n\nHenry VI's queen.\n\nHer son was probably not the son of Henry VI.\n\nHenry VI himself commented that he could not remember\n\nwhen the conception had happened\n\nand that it must have been a miracle.\n\nThis, of course, seems to be very much\n\nlike the situation with Cercei,\n\nwhose children are not that of Robert Baratheon,\n\nbut are indeed the children of herself\n\nand her twin brother, Jaime Lannister.\n\n@sulliscomrade asks, do I have narcolepsy\n\nor do I just have the natural sleep cycle\n\nof a medieval peasant?\n\nSleep? in the Middle Ages was very different\n\nfrom sleep today.\n\nPeople in the Middle Ages generally slept biphasically,\n\nwhich means in two stages.\n\nSo there was what was called the first sleep.\n\nIf you're in a natural sleep rhythm\n\nthat does not have any exposure to unnatural light,\n\nyou'll fall asleep when the sun goes down,\n\nyou will sleep for a few hours,\n\nand then you might get up and maybe around 11, midnight,\n\nmight do some chores, might have sex,\n\nyou might visit your neighbors.\n\nIn early castles,\n\nthe lord and lady usually slept in the Great Hall\n\nbehind where they would sit at table for great feasts.\n\nAll of the king's retainers and loyal warriors\n\nwould also sleep in that same room.\n\nThere might be a screen separating their sleeping quarters\n\nfrom the rest of the hall,\n\nbut there was not a ton of privacy.\n\nThen usually around 2:00 a.m. or so,\n\nyou might enter what's called the second sleep,\n\nand this sleep would go until the sun came up\n\nand you would arise\n\nand get ready to do your chores or your work for the day.\n\nIt's not until the advent of electricity\n\nand people are able to work longer hours\n\nand they need to compress their sleep into one single block\n\nthat we see people sleeping, say,\n\nfrom 10:00 pm. to 6:00 a.m.,\n\nand that is not a natural cycle.\n\n@rahsoose asks, honestly,\n\nwhy do medieval people have so many torture devices?\n\nWhat the [beep] was wrong with those people?\n\nFirst of all, they did not have all those torture devices.\n\nYes, they had some,\n\nbut most torture devices you see came into use\n\nor were invented after the Middle Ages\n\nor they're completely fabricated,\n\nespecially by people in the 19th century\n\nwho for some reason wanted to imagine the Middle Ages\n\nas a time of savagery and barbarism\n\nso by contrast they seemed much more civilized.\n\nSo, for example, you might have the Rack.\n\nThat might be legit.\n\nThere is no Iron Maiden.\n\nThere is no Spanish Tickler.\n\nThere were no chastity belts.\n\nAny chastity belt you have seen in a museum is a fake!\n\n@MedievalScholar asks,\n\nwhat is your favorite medieval castle?\n\nThis is a tough question to answer because I have about 20.\n\nThe top of my list is Windsor Castle.\n\nIt is a great example of a motte-and-bailey castle.\n\nBasically, a motte-and-bailey castle has two parts.\n\nFirst, there would be an earthen mound.\n\nOn top of that, you would build a keep.\n\nBelow and in front of the keep would be the bailey section,\n\nand this is where all the activity\n\nof the household would happen.\n\nA motte-and-bailey castle\n\nwould also have another layer outside that enclosure,\n\nwhich would be a moat.\n\nIf you are a knight in armor,\n\nthe last thing you probably want to do\n\nis swim across the moat.\n\nThe moat also prevents the enemy\n\nfrom tunneling under the castle walls to get to the keep.\n\nIf the enemy forces push through the bailey,\n\nthen everyone retreats into the keep.\n\nFor the most part, a castle was defensive.\n\nIt was not luxurious.\n\nThere are, for example, no hallways in castles.\n\nHallways come about with the advent of the palace,\n\nwhich is post-medieval.\n\nAnd because of this there's really no privacy.\n\n@Shark3143 asks,\n\ndid medieval kings ever just piss in the moat or what?\n\nAbsolutely, and it's not just kings!\n\nToilets tended to be a very, very small sort of closet\n\nthat jutted out over the edge of the walls,\n\nsometimes over the moat,\n\nsometimes just down into a courtyard\n\nand some poor guy had to clean it up.\n\nThese were also called garderobes.\n\nGarderobe means in French, a place to keep your robe,\n\nand if you hung your clothes in the garderobe\n\nnext to all the ammonia scent from the urine,\n\nyou were less likely to get mites\n\nand other creepy crawlies in your clothes.\n\n@Wheezy_814 says,\n\ncould y'all imagine the [beep] swampass people had\n\nduring the medieval times?\n\nYes, in the Middle Ages,\n\nyou absolutely were smelling your neighbors\n\nmuch more than you are today,\n\nbut it is a myth that they were completely unsanitary.\n\nPlenty of medieval cities had bathhouses,\n\nwhere a caller would go through the streets\n\nannouncing when the water was hot.\n\nIn certain medieval communities like Strasbourg,\n\nif you were a civil servant,\n\npart of your salary went towards\n\nbeing able to use the bathhouse once a week\n\nso you could get clean.\n\nIt did smell bad, there were open sewers,\n\nbut it was not as bad as some people might believe.\n\n@cavemanpaints asks,\n\nhow did humanity survive the Black Death\n\nwithout vaccines?\n\nThey did not.\n\nMost of them died.\n\nIf we look at the mortality rate for the Black Death,\n\nwe see that it's something like 80%,\n\nand that means if you contracted plague,\n\nyou had maybe an 18-20% chance of surviving.\n\nOtherwise, you were dead.\n\nThe first big wave, which was about 1346 to 1353,\n\nwipes out half of the population, we now estimate.\n\nThe population didn't have any chance to rebound\n\nbecause plague kept coming back\n\nover and over again up, until 1721.\n\nAnd by the way, if you have seen images\n\nthat supposedly represent what plague doctors looked like,\n\nin sort of a primitive hazmat suit,\n\nno one wore those plague masks in the Middle Ages.\n\nYou should know that that is anachronistic.\n\nIt is wrong.\n\nThat probably came into being\n\nsometime around the 17th century.\n\n@i_love_ur_mom3 says, Hansel and Gretel is brutal.\n\nDid parents even love their children?\n\nInfant mortality was so high in the Middle Ages\n\nthat you might think there's no way\n\nmedieval parents could attach any affection\n\nto children who are very likely to die.\n\nEvidence now shows\n\nthat medieval people seem to have loved their children\n\njust as much as modern people do,\n\nthat they mourned when they died,\n\nthat they worried over them when they were sick.\n\nInfant mortality rates before the first year of life\n\nare somewhere around 80%,\n\nbut if you made it past age five,\n\nthere's no reason why you couldn't live into your sixties,\n\neven seventies, and, in some cases, eighties.\n\nThe rate of infant mortality skews lifespan averages\n\nin the Middle Ages\n\nso that it looks like totally healthy people\n\nare walking around and at age 35, they keel over and die.\n\nThat's not the case.\n\nSince you mentioned Hansel and Gretel,\n\nthis story and other stories like Red Riding Hood\n\nhave one purpose,\n\nto teach your children not to go into the woods.\n\nDangers in the woods include, for example, wolves.\n\nThat was a very large danger.\n\nOn the Continent and in England,\n\nyou also have all kinds of outlaws living in the woods.\n\nThey made their living by thievery, looting,\n\nand all kinds of other unsavory practices\n\n@StrongbowBeleg asks, I must ask,\n\ndid medieval artists actually know what animals look like?\n\nThis image is from the Aberdeen Bestiary.\n\nThese are cats.\n\nYes, indeed, they did know what cats looked like.\n\nWe know that they had cats\n\nand that cats were acting then like cats do now\n\nbecause we have evidence of paw prints,\n\nwalking across medieval manuscripts.\n\nWe do have a medieval manuscript\n\nin which a cat apparently peed on the page\n\nand the monk circled it\n\nand noted which cat had done this to the manuscript.\n\nThe way things were drawn or rendered\n\nwas not meant to be a realistic representation.\n\nIt was meant to be symbolic, flat, 2-D,\n\nand often would have lots of signals or clues\n\nthat had hidden meanings,\n\nespecially in manuscript illuminations.\n\nAnd if you're going for a three-dimensional,\n\nrealistic portrayal, that's not quite as easy to do.\n\n@agneponx asks, how [beep] boring would it have been\n\nto be born in medieval times?\n\nWhat the hell did they do for fun?\n\nThey played all kinds of ball games\n\nthat would involve kicking\n\nor hitting something like an inflated pig's bladder\n\nwith a stick.\n\nLawn bowling, where they would roll smooth stones\n\nto knock someone else's ball out of the way.\n\nThey also played board games.\n\nThere's a game called Fox and Geese\n\nthat's sort of a strategy game.\n\nAnd they played chess.\n\nHere we have an example of a chess piece\n\nfrom the famous Isle of Lewis chess set,\n\nwhich was fashioned out of walrus ivory\n\nsometime in the 12th century.\n\n@atothe_d asks, did medieval court jesters actually exist?\n\nSeems fake.\n\nDoes seem fake, but it's not.\n\nCourt jesters absolutely existed.\n\nThey provided some much needed entertainment,\n\nboth for the king and for nobles assembled at court,\n\nespecially on feast days.\n\nOne famous court jester\n\nwho was at the court of King Henry II\n\nwas asked every year during the Christmas holidays\n\nto put on his signature performance,\n\nwhich was a leap, a whistle, and a fart.\n\nBut jesters, or fools as they were sometimes called,\n\nmight be there just for entertainment, juggling, antics.\n\nOthers might be the individual who was the only individual\n\nwho could speak truth to the king\n\nwithout fear of getting beheaded.\n\nBecause this position of fool or jester was meant\n\non one level not to be taken seriously,\n\nthese individuals could get away\n\nwith giving the king advice or information\n\nor saying things that other people at court just could not.\n\n@kenziexlittle asks,\n\nhow the [beep] did jousting become a thing?\n\nJousting started out as a very necessary, pragmatic activity\n\nthat was to train young knights for warfare.\n\nOver time, however, jousting became something of a spectacle\n\nand this eventually developed\n\ninto the full-fledged tournament,\n\none of which we see in the beginning\n\nof House of the Dragon.\n\nThe basics are there,\n\ntwo knights riding at each other on horseback\n\nwith a very small barrier in between\n\nto keep them to either side of what are known as the lists.\n\nHouse of the Dragon has some of the lower classes there.\n\nThis wouldn't have been the case in the Middle Ages.\n\nThis was really something that the upper classes attended\n\nand the lower classes might be present\n\nas food vendors or sellers of other goods\n\noutside the tournament arena, but not inside.\n\nBoydell & Brewer asks,\n\ndid you know that in Medieval England,\n\nanimals could be tried and convicted of crimes?\n\nThere are records of animals being taken to court.\n\nAnd yes, indeed, there are.\n\nIf an animal had caused damage to crops\n\nor to other livestock or had injured a person,\n\nvery often the animal could be put on trial.\n\nAnd in this case,\n\nthey were often thought to be possessed by Satan\n\nwhen they did these terrible things.\n\nEven more interesting than animals on trial, though,\n\nis the case of animals who became saints.\n\nIn 13th century France,\n\nthere is the story of the Sainted Greyhound,\n\nand this is a story in which the lord of a castle\n\nleaves his young son in a cradle while he goes out hunting\n\nand when he comes back,\n\nhe finds the son's room is a disaster.\n\nThere's blood everywhere.\n\nThe cradle's been overturned.\n\nThe dog has blood on its muzzle,\n\nand so the Lord thinks that the dog has killed his son,\n\nso he kills the greyhound, flips over the cradle,\n\nand finds that, in fact, what the dog had done\n\nwas protect the child from a snake.\n\nAnd the lord feels so bad\n\nthat he creates a shrine to this greyhound,\n\nand her name is Saint Guinefort, and pretty soon,\n\nshe becomes a local patron saint to children.\n\nAnd a little bit later the Catholic church said,\n\nno, you are not allowed to have animal saints.\n\nWhat is wrong with you people?!\n\n@NeffliesStuff asks, Was there a real King Arthur?\n\nMaybe?\n\nIn about 1191, the monks at Glastonbury Abbey claim\n\nthat they have found the grave of King Arthur.\n\nAnd the monks report that in the coffin they discovered,\n\nthere was a very large man\n\nwho had died from an ax blow to the head\n\nand they know it's Arthur's grave\n\nbecause on it is this leaden cross,\n\nand engraved on the cross in sort of very early script,\n\nhere lies buried the renowned King Arthur\n\nin the Isle of Avalon.\n\nNow, in the 20th century,\n\narcheologists excavated where the monks said they had dug\n\nand they found out that, indeed, they had excavated someone.\n\nWhether or not it was actually King Arthur, we don't know.\n\nThe cross itself has been lost.\n\nOne clue that works in favor of this\n\nis the spelling of Arthur's name, Artorius,\n\nwhich is a really early spelling.\n\nIf you were gonna dummy up a cross\n\nto say you found the grave of Arthur in the 12th century,\n\nyou'd probably spell it Artus.\n\nAlso, the shape of the letters\n\nseem to be earlier than 12th century,\n\nalthough, again, that could be part of the forgery.\n\n@XavierTorch asks, did medieval knights name their swords?\n\nBecause that's big in fiction.\n\nIn the medieval tradition,\n\nthe most famous sword is Excalibur,\n\nwhich belongs to King Arthur.\n\nOther medieval individuals who had actual named swords\n\ninclude Charlemagne, who had Joyeuse,\n\nhis nephew, Roland, Durandal.\n\nSome of these would be passed from generation to generation,\n\nand that's one reason why they would have names.\n\nPhysical objects such as the sword\n\nwould help to identify that person\n\nas the new head of the household.\n\n@IreneC_Bgv says, why did the Vikings attack?\n\nWhy these farmers and fishermen suddenly decided\n\nto go looting and pillaging has to do with the possibility\n\nthat maybe the farmland they were working\n\nwas no longer quite as fertile,\n\nand perhaps population had increased to the point\n\nthat you had what's called this youth bulge,\n\nwhere there's too many young men\n\nand not enough for them to do.\n\nWhatever the reason, at the end of the eighth century,\n\nthe Vikings start to move out\n\nfrom what we think of as their home territory\n\nhere in Scandinavia.\n\nAll of these blue pins on the map indicate places\n\nwhere they either set up settlements\n\nor they raided frequently.\n\nThey made most of their money\n\nlooting Christian churches and monasteries.\n\nThe Vikings were not Christian,\n\nso they didn't know what these big structures were,\n\nfull of men who couldn't or wouldn't fight,\n\nexcept for they seemed to be full\n\nof lots of nice, shiny things.\n\nThey sailed up the Seine and attacked Paris.\n\nMade it all the way to the Middle East.\n\nAnd if we go back to France, this area is Normandy.\n\nWhy is it called Normandy?\n\nBecause that is where the north men settled.\n\nThere was almost nowhere that the Vikings did not go\n\nin the Middle Ages.\n\nOh, here's a good one.\n\nWho is your favorite influential woman in history?\n\nI have several favorite medieval women.\n\nRight at the top though has got to be Eleanor of Aquitaine,\n\nwho famously was married\n\nto both the French king and the English king\n\nand was mother to two more kings.\n\nEleanor was the heiress of the huge Duchy of Aquitaine,\n\nwhich is in what today is southern France.\n\nShe was married off to the French king.\n\nOvernight, that almost doubled the size of France.\n\nBut the French king wasn't a great king.\n\nHe would've made a great priest.\n\nEleanor, coming from the south,\n\nwhich was the land of troubadours\n\nand chivalry and courtly love\n\nand where women had much more power and influence,\n\nreally was not having a great time up north in Paris,\n\nwhere people were much more serious.\n\nShe and the French king had two children,\n\nbut after a certain point,\n\nit was clear that this was not working\n\nand they got the Pope to annul their marriage.\n\nOnce she was free,\n\nEleanor wrote to the young Prince Henry,\n\nletting him know that she was available\n\nshould he be interested, and he was.\n\nShe marries Henry\n\nand had an additional eight to ten pregnancies.\n\nShe is the mother of the famous Richard the Lionheart\n\nand the infamous King John.\n\nShe was busy up until the very end of her life.\n\nShe died when she was about 80 years old.\n\n@coveredinliz asks, what did the Holy Grail even do?\n\nJust a pretty cup?\n\nIt is such an important religious object.\n\nEither the cup that Christ drank from at the Last Supper\n\nand/or the cup that Joseph of Arimathea used\n\nto catch Christ's blood when he was on the cross.\n\nWhat's fascinating about the grail legend\n\nin the Arthurian stories\n\nis that no one ever really succeeds.\n\nIn fact, the only knight\n\nwho really has a true measure of success is Sir Galahad.\n\nHe gets to see the grail and when he does see it,\n\nwe are told in Sir Thomas Malory's Morte d'Arthur\n\nthat Galahad had sees something\n\nand we don't get to know what it is.\n\nHis flesh begins to tremble\n\nwhen he beholds these spiritual things\n\nand then he dies and gets taken up to heaven,\n\nwith the grail!\n\nFor everyone else,\n\nthe quest is pretty much a dismal failure.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nThanks very much for watching Medieval Support.\n\n[no audio]", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image":

{"title": "Medievalist Professor Answers Medieval Questions From Twitter", "text": "Transcript\n\nI'm medievalist professor Dorsey Armstrong.\n\nLet's take some questions from the internet.\n\nThis is Medieval Support.\n\n[industrial music]\n\n@JohnnyV45385760 asks,\n\nWhat did medieval English sound like?\n\nA good shorthand way\n\nto figure out what medieval English sounds like\n\nis to take all vowels\n\nand pronounce them as you would in French,\n\nand pronounce every letter.\n\nThe word for wife would be pronounced weef.\n\nThe word for house would be pronounced hus.\n\nThe word knight, k'nigt.\n\nHere is what the Lord's Prayer would've sounded like\n\nin Middle English, probably sometime in the 14th century.\n\nOor father that art in have-nuss,\n\nhallow-ed bay thee nam-eh.\n\nThee ray-um oor kingdom come to bay\n\nand led us not into temp-tass-ee-one,\n\nbut deliver us from ay-vil.\n\n@caffeinateddayes asks, why was it called the Middle Ages?\n\nHow did they know when the end was?\n\nThe name Middle Ages was given to that period\n\nby people who came much later\n\nand the middle that they were thinking of\n\nwas the period roughly from about 500 to 1500,\n\nafter the fall of the Roman Empire\n\nand before the Renaissance.\n\nAround 1000, there is an increase in population,\n\nand so we call this period in between\n\nsay, about 1000 and 1300, the High Middle Ages.\n\nThis is when the university system comes into existence.\n\nThis is when those beautiful cathedrals are all being built.\n\nIt really is a golden age in the medieval period.\n\n@B4wekiss asks, wait?!\n\nThe Game of Thrones Red Wedding really happened?\n\nIt's well known that George R.R. Martin borrowed liberally\n\nfrom medieval history.\n\nThe Red Wedding itself is based on Scottish history.\n\nIn 1440, the young King of Scotland\n\ninvited the young leaders of the Douglas clan\n\nto dine with him.\n\nWhen you're invited into the feast hall,\n\nyou dine with the king.\n\nThe code of hospitality should maintain\n\nthat no Ill can come to you,\n\nand instead they were betrayed and beheaded.\n\nLike in Game of Thrones,\n\nmuch of the contest over the throne\n\nhas to do with rival factions\n\nthat maybe to some degree or another\n\nare related to one another.\n\nGeorge R.R. Martin took as his template for this\n\nthe late medieval conflict known as the Wars of the Roses.\n\nYou have the Lancaster cousins against the York cousins.\n\nAnd in the show, the Lannisters have a name\n\nthat sounds very much like Lancaster,\n\nand the Starks, with their one syllable name,\n\nthat name chimes nicely with York.\n\nAs far as characters go, the mad Targaryen king\n\nwould seem to be a pretty clear analog\n\nto King Henry VI, who suffered bouts of madness.\n\nCercei Lannister very much resembles Margaret of Anjou,\n\nHenry VI's queen.\n\nHer son was probably not the son of Henry VI.\n\nHenry VI himself commented that he could not remember\n\nwhen the conception had happened\n\nand that it must have been a miracle.\n\nThis, of course, seems to be very much\n\nlike the situation with Cercei,\n\nwhose children are not that of Robert Baratheon,\n\nbut are indeed the children of herself\n\nand her twin brother, Jaime Lannister.\n\n@sulliscomrade asks, do I have narcolepsy\n\nor do I just have the natural sleep cycle\n\nof a medieval peasant?\n\nSleep? in the Middle Ages was very different\n\nfrom sleep today.\n\nPeople in the Middle Ages generally slept biphasically,\n\nwhich means in two stages.\n\nSo there was what was called the first sleep.\n\nIf you're in a natural sleep rhythm\n\nthat does not have any exposure to unnatural light,\n\nyou'll fall asleep when the sun goes down,\n\nyou will sleep for a few hours,\n\nand then you might get up and maybe around 11, midnight,\n\nmight do some chores, might have sex,\n\nyou might visit your neighbors.\n\nIn early castles,\n\nthe lord and lady usually slept in the Great Hall\n\nbehind where they would sit at table for great feasts.\n\nAll of the king's retainers and loyal warriors\n\nwould also sleep in that same room.\n\nThere might be a screen separating their sleeping quarters\n\nfrom the rest of the hall,\n\nbut there was not a ton of privacy.\n\nThen usually around 2:00 a.m. or so,\n\nyou might enter what's called the second sleep,\n\nand this sleep would go until the sun came up\n\nand you would arise\n\nand get ready to do your chores or your work for the day.\n\nIt's not until the advent of electricity\n\nand people are able to work longer hours\n\nand they need to compress their sleep into one single block\n\nthat we see people sleeping, say,\n\nfrom 10:00 pm. to 6:00 a.m.,\n\nand that is not a natural cycle.\n\n@rahsoose asks, honestly,\n\nwhy do medieval people have so many torture devices?\n\nWhat the [beep] was wrong with those people?\n\nFirst of all, they did not have all those torture devices.\n\nYes, they had some,\n\nbut most torture devices you see came into use\n\nor were invented after the Middle Ages\n\nor they're completely fabricated,\n\nespecially by people in the 19th century\n\nwho for some reason wanted to imagine the Middle Ages\n\nas a time of savagery and barbarism\n\nso by contrast they seemed much more civilized.\n\nSo, for example, you might have the Rack.\n\nThat might be legit.\n\nThere is no Iron Maiden.\n\nThere is no Spanish Tickler.\n\nThere were no chastity belts.\n\nAny chastity belt you have seen in a museum is a fake!\n\n@MedievalScholar asks,\n\nwhat is your favorite medieval castle?\n\nThis is a tough question to answer because I have about 20.\n\nThe top of my list is Windsor Castle.\n\nIt is a great example of a motte-and-bailey castle.\n\nBasically, a motte-and-bailey castle has two parts.\n\nFirst, there would be an earthen mound.\n\nOn top of that, you would build a keep.\n\nBelow and in front of the keep would be the bailey section,\n\nand this is where all the activity\n\nof the household would happen.\n\nA motte-and-bailey castle\n\nwould also have another layer outside that enclosure,\n\nwhich would be a moat.\n\nIf you are a knight in armor,\n\nthe last thing you probably want to do\n\nis swim across the moat.\n\nThe moat also prevents the enemy\n\nfrom tunneling under the castle walls to get to the keep.\n\nIf the enemy forces push through the bailey,\n\nthen everyone retreats into the keep.\n\nFor the most part, a castle was

closet\n\nthat jutted out over the edge of the walls,\n\nsometimes over the moat,\n\nsometimes just down into a courtyard\n\nand some poor guy had to clean it up.\n\nThese were also called garderobes.\n\nGarderobe means in French, a place to keep your robe,\n\nand if you hung your clothes in the garderobe\n\nnext to all the ammonia scent from the urine,\n\nyou were less likely to get mites\n\nand other creepy crawlies in your clothes.\n\n@Wheezy_814 says,\n\ncould y'all imagine the [beep] swampass people had\n\nduring the medieval times?\n\nYes, in the Middle Ages,\n\nyou

made their living by thievery, looting,\n\nand all kinds of other unsavory practices\n\n@StrongbowBeleg asks, I must ask,\n\ndid medieval artists actually know what animals look like?\n\nThis image is

do.\n\n@agneponx asks, how [beep] boring would it have been\n\nto be born in medieval times?\n\nWhat the hell did they do for fun?\n\nThey played all kinds of ball games\n\nthat would involve kicking\n\nor hitting something like an inflated pig's bladder\n\nwith a stick.\n\nLawn bowling, where they would roll smooth stones\n\nto knock someone else's ball out of the way.\n\nThey also played board games.\n\nThere's a game called Fox and Geese\n\nthat's sort of a strategy game.\n\nAnd they played chess.\n\nHere we have an example of a chess piece\n\nfrom the famous Isle of Lewis chess set,\n\nwhich was fashioned out of walrus ivory\n\nsometime in the 12th century.\n\n@atothe_d asks, did medieval court jesters actually exist?\n\nSeems fake.\n\nDoes seem fake, but it's not.\n\nCourt

were sometimes called,\n\nmight be there just for entertainment, juggling, antics.\n\nOthers might be the individual who was the only individual\n\nwho could speak truth to the king\n\nwithout fear of getting beheaded.\n\nBecause this position of fool or jester was meant\n\non one level not to be taken seriously,\n\nthese individuals could get away\n\nwith giving the king advice or information\n\nor saying things that other people at court just could not.\n\n@kenziexlittle asks,\n\nhow the [beep] did jousting become a thing?\n\nJousting started out as a very necessary, pragmatic activity\n\nthat was to train young knights for warfare.\n\nOver time, however, jousting became something of a spectacle\n\nand this eventually developed\n\ninto the full-fledged tournament,\n\none of which we see in the beginning\n\nof House of the Dragon.\n\nThe basics are there,\n\ntwo knights riding at each other on horseback\n\nwith a very small barrier in between\n\nto keep them to either side of what are known as the lists.\n\nHouse of the Dragon has some of the lower classes there.\n\nThis wouldn't have been the case in the Middle Ages.\n\nThis was really something that the upper classes attended\n\nand the lower classes might be present\n\nas food vendors or sellers of other goods\n\noutside the tournament arena, but not inside.\n\nBoydell & Brewer asks,\n\ndid you know that in Medieval England,\n\nanimals could be tried and convicted of crimes?\n\nThere are records of animals being taken to court.\n\nAnd yes, indeed, there are.\n\nIf an animal had caused damage to crops\n\nor to other livestock or had injured a person,\n\nvery often the animal could be put on trial.\n\nAnd in this case,\n\nthey were often thought to be possessed by Satan\n\nwhen they did these terrible things.\n\nEven more interesting than animals on trial, though,\n\nis the case of animals who became saints.\n\nIn 13th century France,\n\nthere is the story of the Sainted Greyhound,\n\nand this is a story in which the lord of a castle\n\nleaves his young son in a cradle while he goes out hunting\n\nand when he comes back,\n\nhe finds the son's room is a disaster.\n\nThere's blood everywhere.\n\nThe cradle's been overturned.\n\nThe dog has blood on its muzzle,\n\nand so the Lord thinks that the dog has killed his son,\n\nso he kills the greyhound, flips over the cradle,\n\nand finds that, in fact, what the dog had done\n\nwas protect the child from a snake.\n\nAnd the lord feels so bad\n\nthat he creates a shrine to this greyhound,\n\nand her name is Saint Guinefort, and pretty soon,\n\nshe becomes a local patron saint to children.\n\nAnd a little bit later the Catholic church said,\n\nno, you are not allowed to have animal saints.\n\nWhat is wrong with you people?!\n\n@NeffliesStuff asks, Was there a real King Arthur?\n\nMaybe?\n\nIn about 1191, the monks at Glastonbury Abbey claim\n\nthat they have found the grave of King Arthur.\n\nAnd the monks report that in the coffin they discovered,\n\nthere was a very large man\n\nwho had died from an ax blow to the head\n\nand they know it's Arthur's grave\n\nbecause on it is this leaden cross,\n\nand engraved on the cross in sort of very early script,\n\nhere lies buried the renowned King Arthur\n\nin the Isle of Avalon.\n\nNow, in the 20th century,\n\narcheologists excavated where the monks said they had dug\n\nand they found out that, indeed, they had excavated someone.\n\nWhether or not it was actually King Arthur, we don't know.\n\nThe cross itself has been lost.\n\nOne clue that works in favor of this\n\nis the spelling of Arthur's name, Artorius,\n\nwhich is a really early spelling.\n\nIf you were gonna dummy up a cross\n\nto say you found the grave of Arthur in the 12th century,\n\nyou'd probably spell it Artus.\n\nAlso, the shape of the letters\n\nseem to be earlier than 12th century,\n\nalthough, again, that could be part of the forgery.\n\n@XavierTorch asks, did medieval knights name their swords?\n\nBecause that's big in fiction.\n\nIn the medieval tradition,\n\nthe most famous sword is Excalibur,\n\nwhich belongs to King Arthur.\n\nOther medieval individuals who had actual named swords\n\ninclude Charlemagne, who had Joyeuse,\n\nhis nephew, Roland, Durandal.\n\nSome of these would be passed from generation to generation,\n\nand that's one reason why they would have names.\n\nPhysical objects such as the sword\n\nwould help to identify that person\n\nas the new head of the household.\n\n@IreneC_Bgv says, why did the Vikings attack?\n\nWhy these farmers and fishermen suddenly decided\n\nto go looting and pillaging has to do with the possibility\n\nthat maybe the farmland they were working\n\nwas no longer quite as fertile,\n\nand perhaps population had increased to the point\n\nthat you had what's called this youth bulge,\n\nwhere there's too many young men\n\nand not enough for them to do.\n\nWhatever the reason, at the end of the eighth century,\n\nthe Vikings start to move out\n\nfrom what we think of as their home territory\n\nhere in Scandinavia.\n\nAll of these blue pins on the map indicate places\n\nwhere they either set up settlements\n\nor they raided frequently.\n\nThey made most of their money\n\nlooting Christian churches and monasteries.\n\nThe Vikings were not Christian,\n\nso they didn't know what these big structures were,\n\nfull of men who couldn't or wouldn't fight,\n\nexcept for they seemed to be full\n\nof lots of nice, shiny things.\n\nThey sailed up the Seine and attacked Paris.\n\nMade it all the way to the Middle East.\n\nAnd if we go back to France, this area is Normandy.\n\nWhy is it called Normandy?\n\nBecause that is where the north men settled.\n\nThere was almost nowhere that the Vikings did not go\n\nin the Middle Ages.\n\nOh, here's a good one.\n\nWho is your favorite influential woman in history?\n\nI have several favorite medieval women.\n\nRight at the top though has got to be Eleanor of Aquitaine,\n\nwho famously was married\n\nto both the French king and the English king\n\nand was mother to two more kings.\n\nEleanor was the heiress of the huge Duchy of Aquitaine,\n\nwhich is in what today is southern France.\n\nShe was married off to the French king.\n\nOvernight, that almost doubled the size of France.\n\nBut the French king wasn't a great king.\n\nHe would've made a great priest.\n\nEleanor, coming from the south,\n\nwhich was the land of troubadours\n\nand chivalry and courtly love\n\nand where women had much more power and influence,\n\nreally was not having a great time up north in Paris,\n\nwhere people were much more serious.\n\nShe and the French king had two children,\n\nbut after a certain point,\n\nit was clear that this was not working\n\nand they got the Pope to annul their marriage.\n\nOnce she was free,\n\nEleanor wrote to the young Prince Henry,\n\nletting him know that she was available\n\nshould he be interested, and he was.\n\nShe marries Henry\n\nand had an additional eight to ten pregnancies.\n\nShe is the mother of the famous Richard the Lionheart\n\nand the infamous King John.\n\nShe was busy up until the very end of her life.\n\nShe died when she was about 80 years old.\n\n@coveredinliz asks, what did the Holy Grail even do?\n\nJust a pretty cup?\n\nIt is such an important religious object.\n\nEither the cup that Christ drank from at the Last Supper\n\nand/or the cup that Joseph of Arimathea used\n\nto catch Christ's blood when he was on the cross.\n\nWhat's fascinating about the grail legend\n\nin the Arthurian stories\n\nis that no one ever really succeeds.\n\nIn fact, the only knight\n\nwho really has a true measure of success is Sir Galahad.\n\nHe gets to see the grail and when he does see it,\n\nwe are told in Sir Thomas Malory's Morte d'Arthur\n\nthat Galahad had sees something\n\nand we don't get to know what it is.\n\nHis flesh begins to tremble\n\nwhen he beholds these spiritual things\n\nand then he dies and gets taken up to heaven,\n\nwith the grail!\n\nFor everyone else,\n\nthe quest is pretty much a dismal failure.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nThanks very much for watching Medieval Support.\n\n[no audio]", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image":

That is the real answer.\n\nThe real answer is bleak. Yeah, it's intense.\n\nHow does Queen Maeve try to empower Starlight\n\nagainst Vought's manipulative tactics?\n\nShe says, like, Look at me. Look at where I'm at.\n\nLook at the power that you have\n\nand don't let yourself sink down\n\ninto this hole like I have. [bell dings]\n\nI would say you, Starlight,\n\nalso had an impact on her, though,\n\nbecause you inspire her to do the right thing in the end.\n\nYeah. You know?\n\nI think when you've got like, hope,\n\nin a place that's like literally just-\n\nHopeless? A drought,\n\nthat in itself can be contagious.\n\nWhich member of the Seven does Starlight replace\n\nwhen she joins the team?\n\nLamplighter. [bell dings]\n\n[Claudia And Karen] Ding ding ding ding!\n\nWow. Karen's a genius.\n\nThe Seven, you guys are welcome.\n\n[Claudia laughs] You're welcome.\n\nThey needed you. You're welcome.\n\nThey needed you. What can I say?\n\nWhat is Kimiko Miyashiro's superhero alias?\n\nOh.\n\nYou'd think we don't know the show.\n\nThe Female. [bell dings]\n\n[All Three] Yay!\n\nWhen I signed on to do the show,\n\nthe character didn't have a name.\n\nIt was just The Female and Eric surprised me with it.\n\nHe loves to do that.

Because of Soldier Boy.\n\nYes! [bell dings]\n\nThat's right.\n\nWhy is Homelander so weird about milk?\n\nI think that's like, some deep cultural issue.\n\nHe has mommy issues. [bell dings]\n\nLet's not get into that. Let's not.\n\n[Erin sighs]\n\nOh, god. That was a lot.\n\nI know.\n\nYou've done a lot of seasons and a lot of scenes.\n\nI forget half of that.\n\nAt the end of the season,\n\nit's like the Men in Black thing happens and...\n\n[light dings]\n\nThank you guys so much for your questions.\n\nWe loved them and we hope to see you next time\n\nto answer some more.\n\n[upbeat pop music]", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image": "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill,d_placeholder_wired.png,fl_progressive,g_face,h_1080,q_80,w_1920/v1718303642/wired_wi-50-most-googled-cast-of-the-boys.jpg", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.wired.com/video/watch/wi-50-most-googled-cast-of-the-boys", "timestamp": "1719366052.876658", "displayed": 0}

That reminds me, by the way-\n\nAnytime someone asks me if Antony Starr,\n\nwho plays Homelander,\n\nif that's his stage name,\n\nI say yes.\n\n[all three laugh]\n\nHomelander would be such a good name\n\nfor like, a car.\n\nGood marketing, Karen. Yeah.\n\nWas Starlight a pageant kid?\n\nI read that as pregnant.\n\n[all three laugh]\n\nI mean...\n\nWas Starlight pregnant as a child?\n\nAs a kid? Sorry, no. Yes.\n\n[bell dings]\n\nI was a beauty pageant child. Yeah.\n\nYes. Yeah.\n\nCrazy mom, Donna January.\n\nCould Neuman kill Homelander?\n\nHell yeah.\n\nYes! Yes! Girls get it done!\n\nYes!

Yeah, we're biased.\n\nBut, also girls get it done.\n\nWe're all waiting for that.\n\nHow did Starlight get into the Seven?\n\nI'm gonna let you in- By auditioning.\n\nHard work. [bell dings]\n\nHard work. You know, talent.\n\nShe has- Perseverance.\n\nMy audition character for The Boys, the show,\n\nwas Starlight's audition to get into the Seven.\n\nWhich is super meta.\n\nYeah, that's so meta. I love that.\n\nI love that for you.\n\nWhat is Starlight's real name?\n\n[All Three] Annie January.\n\n[bell dings]\n\nDo Hughie and Starlight get together?\n\nThey have. They have. [bell dings]\n\nThey did! Yeah, we did.\n\nThank you, A-train.\n\nI'm kidding.\n\n[all three laugh]\n\nHow does Kimiko get her powers back?\n\nSelf love. [buzzer dings]\n\n[all three laughing] Self love.\n\nInject her.\n\nIs Victoria Neuman evil?\n\nNo. No!\n\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\nShe's gray. A gray area. She has her reasons.\n\nYes. This is fun.\n\nWhy is Ashley going bald?\n\nStress.\n\nEveryone has their own way of coping with stress.\n\nNo one is doing it to her. She's-\n\nShe's doing it to her.\n\nShe's like, she needs to- She's self-soothing.\n\nShe's self-soothing. Yeah.\n\nBy ripping her hair out of her scalp.\n\n[bell dings]\n\nI do love her bald wig. We all do it.\n\nThat she has to put on. It's such a good wig.\n\nSmeagol. Smeagol, yeah! [laugh]\n\nIn a beautiful, sexy way.\n\n[Erin] In a beautiful, yeah, exactly.\n\nColby kills it in that wig.\n\nOh my God. In every scene.\n\nWill the Boys get new powers in season four?\n\nI can't tell you that.\n\nCan't you? Can we?\n\nNo, we can- Next.\n\nNo, no, no, no.\n\nI dunno if we can talk about it.\n\nMove on. I don't wanna get shot.\n\nJust wind down. [laughing]\n\nWhat unique physical ability does Kimiko possess?\n\nYou can, I mean, like, you're obviously really strong\n\nand you dance pretty well.\n\nManiac. I think about that.\n\nYeah. But you heal.\n\n[bell dings]\n\nI do. You heal.\n\nIt's my favorite power. She heals.\n\nAre the Boys good guys?\n\nYou know, it's a gray world.\n\nI think they have good intentions.\n\n[bell dings]\n\nYeah, yeah. Everyone does.\n\nFor the most part.\n\nI feel like our show\n\ndoes a really good job of showing good and bad.\n\nWe possess bad qualities, also good qualities.\n\nRedemptive.\n\nIt's a politically correct answer we're giving.\n\nDid Billy Butcher take Compound V?\n\nYes!

And lies to me.\n\nAnd naked. But don't- And naked.\n\nWhy can't Kimiko speak?\n\nWe cannot answer that question because it is in season four.\n\nOh.\n\nWe can't answer that. We can't.\n\nWe can't tell you that. Nope. No.\n\nWatch the show.\n\nWho does Victoria Neuman secretly work for?\n\n[sighs dramatically]\n\nThat's a secret. Yeah. [chuckles]\n\nI'll never tell. [laughs]\n\nI don't know any of the answers to the Victoria questions.\n\nWell, Victoria in the comic books is Vic the Veep\n\nand he's a dimwitted man.\n\nBut in our show, Stan Edgar.\n\nThey might be asking, like, yeah, yeah.\n\nI'm gonna say Stan.\n\nI'm gonna say father figure Stan.\n\n[bell dings] Giancarlo.\n\nEsposito. Esposito!\n\nLove him.\n\nHow does Kimiko first come into contact with the Boys?\n\nThere's a woman in a cage and then they find her.\n\nShe escapes and then gouges someone's eyes out and...\n\n[bell dings]\n\nIt's like every rom-com that I've seen.\n\nBut how do they- Honestly,\n\nit should be a rom-com.\n\nI'd watch it. It is a rom-com.\n\nWe do watch it. It's the show.\n\nThe Boys is a rom-com. It's a rom-com.\n\nWhat unique powers does Queen Maeve have?\n\nLeaving the scene of a crime early.\n\n[buzzer dings] Early bird.\n\nGetting out.\n\nWhat are Kimiko's powers?\n\nThe healing and the strength.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo powerful. She's so strong.\n\n[bell dings]\n\nShe's so strong. You are.\n\nImmortality is awesome. It's pretty dope.\n\nI would love to fly, just, like on wires.\n\nOh, my god.

Yeah.\n\nYou've seen me with vertigo. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nHow did Starlight trick Homelander?\n\nMm. Hid my phone! [bell dings]\n\nI think- Yeah, that's right.\n\nJust recorded him. Wow, yeah.\n\nTechnology. Still didn't work.\n\nHome Teamers are still at it,\n\nbut you know. What are gonna do?\n\nWhy does Queen Maeve fake her own death?\n\nBecause she's smart and she wants to get out.\n\nI mean, she's so smart.\n\nShe wants out. She's like, I'm done.\n\nIf you're dealing with these people,\n\n[bell dings]\n\nI'd fake my death and go live in The Bahamas or something.\n\nI dunno. Yeah, yeah.\n\nPut me on an island somewhere.\n\nI'm out.\n\nShe's like the person in the scary movie\n\nthat we're all like,\n\nThe sound! Do you hear that sound over there?\n\nAnd she's like, I'm outta this.\n\nThat's so true! That's it.\n\nThat's so true.\n\nShe's like, There's no reception over here.\n\nI'm gonna go this way.\n\nYeah. She's the only survivor.\n\nShe's like, Get outta the house.\n\nShe gets out.\n\nShe gets out. Yeah.\n\nGood for her.\n\nOkay.\n\nWhy did Victoria Neuman do that to everybody\n\nduring the hearing?\n\nI was having a bad day.\n\nYou were going through something.\n\nSecrets. Secrets.\n\nSecrets. Secrets.\n\nShe was frustrated.\n\nShe was really going through it.\n\nShe was having a bad day.\n\nShe felt like it.\n\nI didn't have coffee that day. You know?\n\nShe was hangry. It was pretty intense.\n\nShe was like, Pop some heads. It's fine.\n\nI think that's a really good answer.\n\n[buzzer dings] I don't want the real answer.\n\nThe real answer is bleak. That is the real answer.\n\nThe real answer is bleak. Yeah, it's intense.\n\nHow does Queen Maeve try to empower Starlight\n\nagainst Vought's manipulative tactics?\n\nShe says, like, Look at me. Look at where I'm at.\n\nLook at the power that you have\n\nand don't let yourself sink down\n\ninto this hole like I have. [bell dings]\n\nI would say you, Starlight,\n\nalso had an impact on her, though,\n\nbecause you inspire her to do the right thing in the end.\n\nYeah. You know?\n\nI think when you've got like, hope,\n\nin a place that's like literally just-\n\nHopeless? A drought,\n\nthat in itself can be contagious.\n\nWhich member of the Seven does Starlight replace\n\nwhen she joins the team?\n\nLamplighter. [bell dings]\n\n[Claudia And Karen] Ding ding ding ding!\n\nWow. Karen's a genius.\n\nThe Seven, you guys are welcome.\n\n[Claudia laughs] You're welcome.\n\nThey needed you. You're welcome.\n\nThey needed you. What can I say?\n\nWhat is Kimiko Miyashiro's superhero alias?\n\nOh.\n\nYou'd think we don't know the show.\n\nThe Female. [bell dings]\n\n[All Three] Yay!\n\nWhen I signed on to do the show,\n\nthe character didn't have a name.\n\nIt was just The Female and Eric surprised me with it.\n\nHe loves to do that. He loves doing that.\n\nDuring our first meeting.\n\nI love that. He named me. He named me.\n\nAww. He birthed me.\n\nOkay. Come on, come on.\n\nReady? Rapid fire.\n\nThis is the rapid fire.\n\nReady? Ready? Yeah, yeah.\n\nRapid fire, rapid fire.\n\nWho communicates using sign language\n\nto understand Kimiko better?\n\nFrenchie!

She explodes heads!\n\n[bell dings]\n\nIs Victoria Neuman stronger than Homelander?\n\n[All Three] Yes!\n\n[Karen and Claudia laugh]\n\nWhat is Kimiko's brother's name who also has superpower?\n\nSukenji! [bell dings]\n\nKenji! We love him.\n\nWe do.\n\nOh, it went down!\n\n[laughs] It went in.\n\nExcuse me, sorry. No, stop.\n\nWhy does Kimiko lose her powers?\n\nWait, wait. Because of Soldier Boy.\n\nYes! [bell dings]\n\nThat's right.\n\nWhy is Homelander so weird about milk?\n\nI think that's like, some deep cultural issue.\n\nHe has mommy issues. [bell dings]\n\nLet's not get into that. Let's not.\n\n[Erin sighs]\n\nOh, god. That was a lot.\n\nI know.\n\nYou've done a lot of seasons and a lot of scenes.\n\nI forget half of that.\n\nAt the end of the season,\n\nit's like the Men in Black thing happens and...\n\n[light dings]\n\nThank you guys so much for your questions.\n\nWe loved them and we hope to see you next time\n\nto answer some more.\n\n[upbeat pop music]", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image": "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill,d_placeholder_wired.png,fl_progressive,g_face,h_1080,q_80,w_1920/v1718303642/wired_wi-50-most-googled-cast-of-the-boys.jpg", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.wired.com/video/watch/wi-50-most-googled-cast-of-the-boys", "timestamp": "1719366053.720795", "displayed": 0}

Goggins\n\nand this is the Wired Auto Complete Interview.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nOkay.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nWhere did Walton Goggins grow up?\n\nI grew up in a little bitty town called Lithia Springs,\n\nwhich is about 20 minutes outside of Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nIt's a beautiful little town.\n\nIt only had one stop sign\n\nand nobody else is from there but me.\n\nDoes Walton Goggins really have a southern accent?\n\nI do have a Southern accent, you know,\n\nbecause I'm from the south,\n\nso I speak like the other people speak that I grew up with.\n\nI can change it.\n\nI can't really do many accents.\n\nI mean, I can do Southern accent\n\nand I can just do one\n\nthat has just a slight southern accent to it.\n\nThat's about it.\n\nIt's the only range I have.\n\nWalton Goggins looks like Jim Morrison.\n\nThank you.\n\nReally?\n\nJim Morrison if he had teeth this big, I'll take it.\n\nLast one.\n\nWalton Goggins photography.\n\nOh, I like taking photos.\n\nI like traveling and I like taking pictures of the people\n\nthat I meet along the way.\n\nSo photography for me is a really big deal.\n\nIt's the way I document my experiences.\n\nCheck this out.\n\nNext.\n\nThis guy, is he in the union?\n\nWhat is Walton Goggins best known for?\n\nWell, depends on who you ask, right?\n\nI like to think clogging, but most people would disagree.\n\nMaybe The Hateful Eight.\n\nMaybe The Shield, may be Justified,\n\nmaybe Vice Principals,\n\nmaybe The Righteous Gemstones.\n\nBut right now, it's for Fallout.\n\nOkay.\n\nWalton Goggins upcoming projects.\n\nFallout season two.\n\nOh, and I am currently doing the White Lotus season three.\n\nHow about that?\n\nUnbelievable.\n\nWe're filming it down in Thailand.\n\nWalton Goggins, Quentin Tarantino.\n\nOh, how about that?\n\nWhen I was a little kid, I never thought I would see this\n\nname next to this name.\n\nI worked with Quentin two times on Django Unchained\n\nand The Hateful Eight.\n\nAnd he is my favorite filmmaker.\n\nLiving or deceased.\n\nThank God he's still living, my favorite.\n\nOkay, Walton Goggins western movies.\n\nI've been in a few of those.\n\nI love western movies.\n\nI love watching western movies.\n\nMy son was 11 years old when we really started\n\nintroducing him to a lot of different films.\n\nAnd the western genre was the first one\n\nthat we started with.\n\nLike The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,\n\nRio Bravo, Stagecoach, and all the rest of them.\n\nAnd he loves the westerns as much as I do.\n\nSergio Leone, I love you.\n\nOh, one fan fact.\n\nEnnio Morricone,\n\nyou know the great guy who won the Academy Award,\n\nwho did all of Leone's films?\n\nI got to record with him at Abbey Road in London.\n\nHow about that?\n\nCan Walton Goggins sing?\n\nYou know, the greatest compliment I've ever been given,\n\ntrue story, was Walton Goggins can sing\n\nwell enough to believe that he would never\n\nmake it as a singer.\n\nTrue story.\n\nCan Walton Goggins clog?\n\nYeah.\n\nIf this was a full shot, I would clog for you here,\n\nbut it's not.\n\nSo I can't.\n\nJust trust that these feet were made for clogging.\n\n'Cause my mother was a clogger\n\nand she got me into a clogging class.\n\nBelieve it or not.\n\nThat was a thing in Lithia Springs, Georgia, where I'm from.\n\nAnd she did it because my mom loves to dance\n\nand she wanted me to dance with her.\n\nSo I learned how to clog, but I also learned how to bop\n\nand bopping is the Florida version\n\nof the North Carolina shag.\n\nIt's super cool.\n\nYou know what else my mom taught me\n\nthat's not on this list?\n\nShe taught me how to two step\n\nand I'm a mean two stepper.\n\nWalton Goggins Misbehavin.\n\nYes, this is a song that I sang with Jennifer Nettles\n\nin season one of The Righteous Gemstones.\n\nThe thing that I had going for me was singing it\n\nwith Jennifer Nettles.\n\nThey boosted all of the lines that she sang\n\nand they brought all the lines that I sang down.\n\nYou know what?\n\nMaybe you know this lyric?\n\nRunning through the house with a pickle in my mouth.\n\nThank you.\n\nWow.\n\nGod, you should do this for a living.\n\nIt's extraordinary.\n\nIs Walton Goggins a bad guy in Fallout?\n\nOh, a great, great question.\n\nThe thing that I love about doing Fallout so much,\n\nit was architected in a way that the antagonist\n\nbecomes the protagonist\n\nthat may also become the antagonist again.\n\nAnd I would say that that applies\n\nto everybody that's in the show.\n\nIt takes a lot of energy to survive in the wasteland.\n\nAnd sometimes you gotta be a good guy\n\nand sometimes you gotta be a bad guy.\n\nIs Walton Goggins a nice guy?\n\n[beep], yes, I am.\n\nI'm the nicest guy.\n\nWhere's the next [beep] card, man?\n\nJust kidding.\n\nCan I cuss?\n\nI don't even know if I can cuss.\n\nOkay, is Walton Goggins...\n\nWow, this is a long piece of tape.\n\nThis is scaring me.\n\nComing back to Justified.\n\nI would absolutely love to come back to Justified.\n\nSo would Tim Olyphant,\n\nand I know FX would like to have Justified\n\nback on the air.\n\nIt's just a matter of timing.\n\nNext card.\n\n[beep], man.\n\nThank God you're not in the union.\n\nWhen does Walton Goggins\n\nappear in Righteous Gemstones?\n\nOh, okay, that's a very good question.\n\nEpisode three, season one.\n\nAnd I appear in The Righteous Gemstones\n\nin a bathtub for the very first time.\n\nAnd I stand up and I am naked in that bathtub.\n\nIt wasn't my actual body and it wasn't my anatomy.\n\nIt was a 78-year-old stand-in\n\nthat they flew in from Chicago.\n\nI got a call after the first...\n\nThat episode appeared,\n\nand a really good friend of mine said,\n\nmy God, your body looks so good, Walton.\n\nWhat?\n\nIt's not my body.\n\nThat's a 78-year-old stand-in.\n\nNext.\n\nWalton Goggins, Vice Principals.\n\nMm hmm.\n\nThat was literally one of the greatest\n\nexperiences of my life, honest to check.\n\nWalton Goggins on The Shield.\n\nLet's segue into a drama.\n\nAgain, another one of the greatest experiences of my life.\n\nWe filmed it in Los Angeles.\n\nMichael Chiklis and Kenny Johnson\n\nare still some of my best friends today.\n\nWe did The Shield over seven years.\n\nIt totaled 84 hours of television.\n\nThe Sopranos were on at the same time that we were.\n\nBut no one, no actor had been given the opportunity\n\nto play the same character in a serialized format\n\nfor 84 hours.\n\nWe had no idea that we were astronauts\n\nkind of in this world, if you will.\n\nAnd when we shot the pilot,\n\nno one had any idea that seven years later\n\nwe would be ending this story,\n\nhaving explored every aspect\n\nof their psychology, if you will.\n\nIt was and will remain\n\none of the greatest experiences of my life.\n\nNext.\n\nThank you.\n\nWalton Goggins.\n\nHey, I know him.\n\nWalton Goggins, Venus Van Dam.\n\nOh, now this is my girl, Venus Van Dam.\n\nKurt Sutter, the writer of Sons of Anarchy,\n\nwas one of the main writers on The Shield,\n\na very, very dear friend of mine.\n\nAnd the truth is, this is a true story.\n\nHe did an an interview where he said that\n\nthe only two people that I could never have on my show\n\nare Michael Chiklis and Walton Goggins,\n\nbecause no one could ever see them as anything\n\nbut their characters on The Shield.\n\nSomeone sent this article to me, I read it,\n\nI forwarded it to Kurt Sutter.\n\nAnd I said, you, [beep] you, man.\n\nI wouldn't do your show anyway.\n\nTrue story.\n\nI said, the only way that I would do your show\n\nis if I played a transgender.\n\nTwo years later, he sent me a text\n\nand he said, were you serious?\n\nAnd I said, about what?\n\nHe said, about playing a transgender.\n\nAnd I said, do you have pages?\n\nHe said, yes.\n\nHe sent them.\n\nI read them and it was one of the greatest things\n\nthat I had ever read.\n\nAnd it made me laugh and it broke my heart.\n\nAnd so I bought a pair of high heels\n\nwhile we were doing Django Unchained.\n\nAnd I walked the streets of New Orleans\n\nafter wrap at like midnight every night\n\nfor the better part of a month, just to get used to it.\n\nIf you can walk on high heels on cobblestone streets,\n\nyou could walk in them anywhere.\n\nI don't feel like I did that show\n\nbecause it took four and a half hours to get made up.\n\nI would come very early in the morning\n\nand no one outta respect for me\n\nand deference to Venus,\n\nno one ever saw that transition\n\nexcept the people that were working on it.\n\nCharlie and Kim and all the boys on the show\n\nonly ever met me as Venus Van Dam.\n\nWe had been friends for years before that,\n\nbut they never talked to me as Walton.\n\nThey only referred to me as Venus.\n\nAnd they treated me like the lady that I was.\n\nIt will remain one of the...\n\nAlso one of the greatest experiences of my life.\n\nWalton Goggins, White Lotus.\n\nLet me just say that again.\n\nWalton Goggins, White Lotus, season three,\n\nfilming it right now in Thailand.\n\nMike White has a unique way in which he observes the world.\n\nHe is able to articulate\n\nthrough dialogue an existential crisis of people\n\nthat is applicable to people from all walks of life,\n\nfrom all of these different character voices.\n\nAnd the thing about Mike White,\n\nwhich not a lot of people know outside of the business,\n\nis he writes all of it.\n\nHe does it all himself.\n\nOkay, Walton Goggins, Shanghai Noon.\n\nYeah, I did that.\n\nThere was a time in my life where I...\n\nI don't know if I manifested it,\n\nbut I just kind of concentrated on people\n\nthat I wanted to work with.\n\nAnd it started with Robert Duvall\n\nand I did The Apostle with Robert Duvall.\n\nAbout four months after I spent obsessing over\n\nthe fact that I wanted to work with Robert Duvall.\n\nOwen Wilson?\n\nI did the same thing.\n\nBottle Rocket was one of my favorite movies\n\nand remains this day to be one of my favorite movies.\n\nAnd Owen was the guy that I really wanted to work with.\n\nLo and behold, I got a call to come in\n\nand meet with Tom Dey, the director,\n\nand got the role of this movie with Owen\n\nand we became friends over the course of making it.\n\nAnd he is everything that I hoped he would be.\n\nIt was a great experience.\n\nWatch this.\n\nWell, that's it.\n\nWe're out of boards.\n\nI've never really thought about questions\n\nthat people ask when they Google my name,\n\nbut this has been illuminating in many, many ways.\n\nI hope that this satiates your curiosity.\n\nThank you very much for Googling me.\n\n[upbeat music]", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image":

was a little kid, I never thought I would see this\n\nname next to this name.\n\nI worked with Quentin two times on Django Unchained\n\nand The Hateful Eight.\n\nAnd he is my favorite filmmaker.\n\nLiving or deceased.\n\nThank God he's still living, my favorite.\n\nOkay, Walton Goggins western movies.\n\nI've been in a few of those.\n\nI love western movies.\n\nI love watching western movies.\n\nMy son was 11 years old when we really started\n\nintroducing him to a lot of different films.\n\nAnd the western genre was the first one\n\nthat we started with.\n\nLike The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,\n\nRio Bravo, Stagecoach, and all the rest of them.\n\nAnd he loves the westerns as much as I do.\n\nSergio Leone, I love you.\n\nOh, one fan fact.\n\nEnnio Morricone,\n\nyou know the great guy who won the Academy Award,\n\nwho did all of Leone's films?\n\nI got to record with him at Abbey Road in London.\n\nHow about that?\n\nCan Walton Goggins sing?\n\nYou know, the greatest compliment I've ever been given,\n\ntrue story, was Walton Goggins can sing\n\nwell enough to believe that he would never\n\nmake it as a singer.\n\nTrue story.\n\nCan Walton Goggins clog?\n\nYeah.\n\nIf this was a full shot, I would clog for you here,\n\nbut it's not.\n\nSo I can't.\n\nJust trust that these feet were made for clogging.\n\n'Cause my mother was a clogger\n\nand she got me into a clogging class.\n\nBelieve it or not.\n\nThat was a thing in Lithia Springs, Georgia, where I'm from.\n\nAnd she did it because my mom loves to dance\n\nand she wanted me to dance with her.\n\nSo I learned how to clog, but I also learned how to bop\n\nand bopping is the Florida version\n\nof the North Carolina shag.\n\nIt's super cool.\n\nYou know what else my mom taught me\n\nthat's not on this list?\n\nShe taught me how to two step\n\nand I'm a mean two stepper.\n\nWalton Goggins Misbehavin.\n\nYes, this is a song that I sang with Jennifer Nettles\n\nin season one of The Righteous Gemstones.\n\nThe thing that I had going for me was singing it\n\nwith Jennifer Nettles.\n\nThey boosted all of the lines that she sang\n\nand they brought all the lines that I sang down.\n\nYou know what?\n\nMaybe you know this lyric?\n\nRunning through the house with a pickle in my mouth.\n\nThank you.\n\nWow.\n\nGod, you should do this for a living.\n\nIt's extraordinary.\n\nIs Walton Goggins a bad guy in Fallout?\n\nOh, a great, great question.\n\nThe thing that I love about doing Fallout so much,\n\nit was architected in a way that the antagonist\n\nbecomes the protagonist\n\nthat may also become the antagonist again.\n\nAnd I would say that that applies\n\nto everybody that's in the show.\n\nIt takes a lot of energy to survive in the wasteland.\n\nAnd sometimes you gotta be a good guy\n\nand sometimes you gotta be a bad guy.\n\nIs Walton Goggins a nice guy?\n\n[beep], yes, I am.\n\nI'm the nicest guy.\n\nWhere's the next [beep] card, man?\n\nJust kidding.\n\nCan I cuss?\n\nI don't even know if I can cuss.\n\nOkay, is Walton Goggins...\n\nWow, this is a long piece of tape.\n\nThis is scaring me.\n\nComing back to Justified.\n\nI would absolutely love to come back to Justified.\n\nSo would Tim Olyphant,\n\nand I know FX would like to have Justified\n\nback on the air.\n\nIt's just a matter of timing.\n\nNext card.\n\n[beep], man.\n\nThank God you're not in the union.\n\nWhen does Walton Goggins\n\nappear in Righteous Gemstones?\n\nOh, okay, that's a very good question.\n\nEpisode three, season one.\n\nAnd I appear in The Righteous Gemstones\n\nin a bathtub for the very first time.\n\nAnd I stand up and I am naked in that bathtub.\n\nIt wasn't my actual body and it wasn't my anatomy.\n\nIt was a 78-year-old stand-in\n\nthat they flew in from Chicago.\n\nI got a call after the first...\n\nThat episode appeared,\n\nand a really good friend of mine said,\n\nmy God, your body looks so good, Walton.\n\nWhat?\n\nIt's not my body.\n\nThat's a 78-year-old stand-in.\n\nNext.\n\nWalton Goggins, Vice Principals.\n\nMm hmm.\n\nThat was literally one of the greatest\n\nexperiences of my life, honest to check.\n\nWalton Goggins on The Shield.\n\nLet's segue into a drama.\n\nAgain, another one of the greatest experiences of my life.\n\nWe filmed it in Los Angeles.\n\nMichael Chiklis and Kenny Johnson\n\nare still some of my best friends today.\n\nWe did The Shield over seven years.\n\nIt totaled 84 hours of television.\n\nThe Sopranos were on at the same time that we were.\n\nBut no one, no actor had been given the opportunity\n\nto play the same character in a serialized format\n\nfor 84 hours.\n\nWe had no idea that we were astronauts\n\nkind of in this world, if you will.\n\nAnd when we shot the pilot,\n\nno one had any idea that seven years later\n\nwe would be ending this story,\n\nhaving explored every aspect\n\nof their psychology, if you will.\n\nIt was and will remain\n\none of the greatest experiences of my life.\n\nNext.\n\nThank you.\n\nWalton Goggins.\n\nHey, I know him.\n\nWalton Goggins, Venus Van Dam.\n\nOh, now this is my girl, Venus Van Dam.\n\nKurt Sutter, the writer of Sons of Anarchy,\n\nwas one of the main writers on The Shield,\n\na very, very dear friend of mine.\n\nAnd the truth is, this is a true story.\n\nHe did an an interview where he said that\n\nthe only two people that I could never have on my show\n\nare Michael Chiklis and Walton Goggins,\n\nbecause no one could ever see them as anything\n\nbut their characters on The Shield.\n\nSomeone sent this article to me, I read it,\n\nI forwarded it to Kurt Sutter.\n\nAnd I said, you, [beep] you, man.\n\nI wouldn't do your show anyway.\n\nTrue story.\n\nI said, the only way that I would do your show\n\nis if I played a transgender.\n\nTwo years later, he sent me a text\n\nand he said, were you serious?\n\nAnd I said, about what?\n\nHe said, about playing a transgender.\n\nAnd I said, do you have pages?\n\nHe said, yes.\n\nHe sent them.\n\nI read them and it was one of the greatest things\n\nthat I had ever read.\n\nAnd it made me laugh and it broke my heart.\n\nAnd so I bought a pair of high heels\n\nwhile we were doing Django Unchained.\n\nAnd I walked the streets of New Orleans\n\nafter wrap at like midnight every night\n\nfor the better part of a month, just to get used to it.\n\nIf you can walk on high heels on cobblestone streets,\n\nyou could walk in them anywhere.\n\nI don't feel like I did that show\n\nbecause it took four and a half hours to get made up.\n\nI would come very early in the morning\n\nand no one outta respect for me\n\nand deference to Venus,\n\nno one ever saw that transition\n\nexcept the people that were working on it.\n\nCharlie and Kim and all the boys on the show\n\nonly ever met me as Venus Van Dam.\n\nWe had been friends for years before that,\n\nbut they never talked to me as Walton.\n\nThey only referred to me as Venus.\n\nAnd they treated me like the lady that I was.\n\nIt will remain one of the...\n\nAlso one of the greatest experiences of my life.\n\nWalton Goggins, White Lotus.\n\nLet me just say that again.\n\nWalton Goggins, White Lotus, season three,\n\nfilming it right now in Thailand.\n\nMike White has a unique way in which he observes the world.\n\nHe is able to articulate\n\nthrough dialogue an existential crisis of people\n\nthat is applicable to people from all walks of life,\n\nfrom all of these different character voices.\n\nAnd the thing about Mike White,\n\nwhich not a lot of people know outside of the business,\n\nis he writes all of it.\n\nHe does it all himself.\n\nOkay, Walton Goggins, Shanghai Noon.\n\nYeah, I did that.\n\nThere was a time in my life where I...\n\nI don't know if I manifested it,\n\nbut I just kind of concentrated on people\n\nthat I wanted to work with.\n\nAnd it started with Robert Duvall\n\nand I did The Apostle with Robert Duvall.\n\nAbout four months after I spent obsessing over\n\nthe fact that I wanted to work with Robert Duvall.\n\nOwen Wilson?\n\nI did the same thing.\n\nBottle Rocket was one of my favorite movies\n\nand remains this day to be one of my favorite movies.\n\nAnd Owen was the guy that I really wanted to work with.\n\nLo and behold, I got a call to come in\n\nand meet with Tom Dey, the director,\n\nand got the role of this movie with Owen\n\nand we became friends over the course of making it.\n\nAnd he is everything that I hoped he would be.\n\nIt was a great experience.\n\nWatch this.\n\nWell, that's it.\n\nWe're out of boards.\n\nI've never really thought about questions\n\nthat people ask when they Google my name,\n\nbut this has been illuminating in many, many ways.\n\nI hope that this satiates your curiosity.\n\nThank you very much for Googling me.\n\n[upbeat music]", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image":

{"title": "Violinist Answers Violin Questions From Twitter", "text": "Transcript\n\nHi, I'm Andrew Bird.\n\nI'm a songwriter and composer.\n\nAnd I'm here today\n\nto answer your questions from the internet.\n\nWelcome to Violin Support.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nFirst question, latelordchatham.\n\nHave just had my violin lesson.\n\nI cannot get vibrato.\n\nI actually cannot.\n\nWhat is the secret?\n\nVibrato takes a long time.\n\nAs with every little technique, you kind of get it\n\nand then you're doing one little thing wrong\n\nand then it all kind of falls apart.\n\nVibrato is when you're...\n\n[violin playing]\n\nYou can see my last knuckle is kind of flexing a little bit\n\nand I'm moving the hand like this, not like this.\n\nAnd...\n\n[violin playing]\n\nBut just be patient.\n\nIt's just muscle memory.\n\nIt takes a long time.\n\nYou'll get it.\n\nOkay, this is from cowboiklaus.\n\nHow expensive are violins?\n\nLike I'm asking for a friend.\n\nViolins are quite expensive.\n\nBaffles me sometimes like a vintage guitar\n\nthat's super cool\n\nand sexy-looking is still somewhat affordable.\n\nTo get a violin that starts to be just playable\n\nand decent, not much under eight grand or 10 grand.\n\nThey just don't sound very good.\n\nI don't know why that is.\n\nIt's an art.\n\nIt's really tricky to shave down the wood thin enough.\n\nThere's a lot of nuance to making a good violin.\n\nThe market is very, it's very high.\n\nEmKenWheel.\n\nI've never understood how to hold a violin bow properly.\n\nAnother one that takes longer than almost anything\n\nto get with playing the violin,\n\nmore than figuring out where your fingers go\n\nis the bow technique 'cause it's a bit abstract.\n\nWhen I used to teach, I would tell my students\n\nto pretend that they're lying in a canoe\n\nand they've got their arm draped over the side in the water\n\nand they're dragging their arm through the water.\n\nYou got a very light touch on the bow.\n\nAny kind of like, death grip on the bow makes it not work.\n\nSo you got the bare minimum pressure on the bow,\n\nand your wrist is a hinge.\n\nAnd you're kind of leading this way\n\nand everything's trailing behind,\n\nlike dragging through the wind.\n\nThis one's from _Aware_Wolf.\n\nIs there a difference between a fiddle and a violin?\n\nOr is it that one of the players is classically trained\n\nand the other has a recipe for possum?\n\nWell, you don't need to get into stereotypes here.\n\nLet's just say it's basically function of it.\n\nViolin is listening music,\n\nand fiddle is functional, dance music.\n\nAnd the techniques,\n\ncreating your own backbeat, that's fiddle playing.\n\nIt tends to be a little rougher around the edges\n\nbecause the point of it\n\nis to drive social dance situations.\n\nSo social music versus like, listening music.\n\nViolin versus fiddle.\n\nBut otherwise,\n\nthere's no difference in the instrument itself.\n\nAnd this one is FishyIrfan.\n\nI should have attended a pre-concert explanation\n\nabout the difference between baroque violin\n\nand modern violin technique.\n\nThe main difference is there's little to no vibrato\n\nin baroque violin.\n\nAnd that means Mozart\n\nis really not supposed to be played vibrato\n\nif you want to be accurate\n\n'cause it sounds a little more like fiddle music in a way.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nAnd it's very resonant, and early music is very.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nLike, that's a sympathetic resonation of I'm playing\n\na D on the G-string.\n\nSo I have an open D next to it\n\nso it creates this extra resonance.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nWhereas I would play a C right below it,\n\nthere is no sympathetic sea stringing to that saw.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nIt's a little more dry-sounding.\n\nSo it's like natural reverb,\n\nwhen you get that extra string vibrating next to it.\n\n'Cause the sound waves go off of the string\n\nand hit the string next to it,\n\nand if it's the same note,\n\nit'll start vibrating sympathetically.\n\nThis is from pateverman.\n\nI must know the secrets\n\nof how to make the Stradivarius violet.\n\nWell a lot of people have been trying to figure that out.\n\nIt's a beautiful sound, but it's a very specific sound.\n\nIt's not always what you want.\n\nThe Stradivarius is an ancient instrument,\n\nand it is a more focused and goes into other senses.\n\nIt's like a, you know, succulent kind of sound.\n\nRich and dark, very dark.\n\nI mean first of all,\n\nthey were made in the 16 hundreds, generally, 17.\n\nIt was a family business,\n\nso it stretched over a period of time.\n\nSome say it's the particular wood that they sourced\n\nor the way they treated it or the way they've varnished it.\n\nScientists have taken this on as like a little project\n\n'cause they think, Oh there must be some quantifiable way\n\nto recreate the Stradivarius.\n\nAnd they've learned some interesting things,\n\nbut no one's really been able to quite pull it off.\n\nColin, it's 7619.\n\nThe violin doesn't work because there's no rosin.\n\nWTF is rosin.\n\nThe rosin is what makes the horse hair on the bow\n\ngrip a string and cause it to resonate.\n\nYou take this stuff, some sort of a resin,\n\njust go like that.\n\nComes off and you don't need much.\n\nIf you touch the bow with your hand,\n\nthe grease or oils from your hand will cause it to slick\n\nand it'll just go [shushing].\n\nIt'll just be like, it won't grip.\n\nThis one is from aileenyhaha.\n\nWould anyone please teach me how to use a loop pedal?\n\nCould be key for solo gigs.\n\nI've been using this loop pedal for years.\n\nIt's from the mid nineties.\n\nThe chip in it is apparently ancient.\n\nAnd it has a loop function where you get either 26 seconds\n\nto make a phrase\n\nthat once you click record again, it starts over that phrase\n\nand keeps recording so you can layer on top of that.\n\nThat's our loop.\n\nI usually start with pizzicato.\n\nIt's like playing the violin like a guitar.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nSo I'll start a phrase like this.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nSo I just sort of improvised\n\nsomething that's sort of polyrhythmic, has a groove to it.\n\nSo I've got my rhythmic skeleton here,\n\nand then I might improvise something on top of that.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nSo that just started out as like a novel way\n\nto expand this otherwise linear instrument\n\ninto like a cordal instrument, and just to try out ideas.\n\nSamSaltyScience.\n\nAnyone know how to properly tune a violin?\n\nGoogling and tuning apps are only getting me so far.\n\nUsually you start with A.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nThe violin is in fifths, the interval is fifths.\n\nGuitars are in fourths, so...\n\n[violin playing]\n\nYou get used to the sound\n\nof what a fifth being in tune sounds like.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nYou can actually hear this like [chattering] sound of these,\n\nthe sound waves fighting against,\n\nand being out of sync with each other.\n\nBut when they get in sync, it all...\n\n[violin playing]\n\nSo there's flat.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nWhen I'm turning the tuning peg up,\n\nbringing the D-ring up to the A string\n\nand you hear dissonant dissonant undertones,\n\ndoesn't sound right and then suddenly ah,\n\nyou know, satisfaction.\n\nIt's a perfect fifth.\n\nStayMoment.\n\nHow do violin players not go effing deaf\n\nwith that shit near their ears?\n\nSince the advent of amplification,\n\nwe've got worse things to worry about\n\nthan the acoustic instrument\n\nbeing somewhat close to your ears.\n\nBut they do.\n\nMost violinists have hearing loss in their left ear\n\nfrom playing, you know, right here.\n\nAnd that's just a fact.\n\nI'm sure I do.\n\nW-L-W kaeya.\n\nThis is a genuine question for violin players\n\n'cause I don't know\n\nif y'all just can't follow tempo for some reason,\n\nbut why is it that every violinist I've ever seen\n\nspeeds up any song they play?\n\nAny instrumentalist might have trouble speeding up,\n\nespecially when you get in front of a bunch of people\n\nin a performance and the adrenaline kicks in.\n\nThe natural inclination is to speed up.\n\nAll players have to develop a good sense of time.\n\nPlaying with a drummer certainly helps.\n\nThat's why a lot of live records, it feels great\n\nfor everybody at the time, the audience and the players,\n\nbut you listen to the recording, you're like,\n\nOh, this is not gonna stand up on an album\n\nbecause it's too exciting.\n\nIt doesn't stand up to repeated listens.\n\nBut it doesn't mean it's not right in the moment.\n\nI'm guilty of it sometimes,\n\nbut it's usually when I'm playing a big show\n\nfor thousands of people and like, your adrenaline's way up.\n\nThe whole band gets that feeling.\n\nAll right,\n\nthat looks like that's all the questions for today.\n\nThanks so much.\n\nCarry on.\n\n[upbeat music]", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image":

A string\n\nand you hear dissonant dissonant undertones,\n\ndoesn't sound right and then suddenly ah,\n\nyou know, satisfaction.\n\nIt's a perfect fifth.\n\nStayMoment.\n\nHow do violin players not go effing deaf\n\nwith that shit near their ears?\n\nSince the advent of amplification,\n\nwe've got worse things to worry about\n\nthan the acoustic instrument\n\nbeing somewhat close to your ears.\n\nBut they do.\n\nMost violinists have hearing loss in their left ear\n\nfrom playing, you know, right here.\n\nAnd that's just a fact.\n\nI'm sure I do.\n\nW-L-W kaeya.\n\nThis is a genuine question for violin players\n\n'cause I don't know\n\nif y'all just can't follow tempo for some reason,\n\nbut why is it that every violinist I've ever seen\n\nspeeds up any song they play?\n\nAny instrumentalist might have trouble speeding up,\n\nespecially when you get in front of a bunch of people\n\nin a performance and the adrenaline kicks in.\n\nThe natural inclination is to speed up.\n\nAll players have to develop a good sense of time.\n\nPlaying with a drummer certainly helps.\n\nThat's why a lot of live records, it feels great\n\nfor everybody at the time, the audience and the players,\n\nbut you listen to the recording, you're like,\n\nOh, this is not gonna stand up on an album\n\nbecause it's too exciting.\n\nIt doesn't stand up to repeated listens.\n\nBut it doesn't mean it's not right in the moment.\n\nI'm guilty of it sometimes,\n\nbut it's usually when I'm playing a big show\n\nfor thousands of people and like, your adrenaline's way up.\n\nThe whole band gets that feeling.\n\nAll right,\n\nthat looks like that's all the questions for today.\n\nThanks so much.\n\nCarry on.\n\n[upbeat music]", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image":

{"title": "Lando Norris & Oscar Piastri Answer Formula 1 Questions From Twitter", "text": "Transcript\n\nI'm Lando Norris.\n\nAnd I'm Oscar Piastri.\n\nAnd we're from Team McLaren.\n\nAnd today, we're gonna answer\n\nsome questions from the internet.\n\nThis is Formula 1 Support.\n\n[deep bass playing]\n\nYou got a little question from @theulteriorkid.\n\nIs it true that F1 drivers can tell\n\nwhat course it is from just hearing\n\nan audio recording of it?\n\nI've seen people do it before.\n\nI feel like I'm gonna be terrible at this.\n\n[cars revving]\n\nWell, this is coming down the pit lane.\n\nPit lane, Yeah.\n\nLong pit lane.\n\nOkay.\n\nThis is a very slow corner.\n\nI reckon it's Bahrain.\n\nYeah, a quick turn to,\n\nYou think Bahrain, huh?\n\nI think Bahrain.\n\n[Producer] You're right.\n\n[Lando] It is. There you go.\n\nIt's true.\n\nIt's possible.\n\nTheulteriorkid, it's true. Yeah.\n\nSo, that was just done via our knowledge\n\nof distance of pit exit.\n\nYeah.\n\nTo turn one.\n\nThe distance from the pit lane\n\nto the first corner is always different\n\ndepending on the track.\n\nIt sounded like we got up to like, I don't know,\n\nfifth gear or sixth gear and then we went down\n\na lot of gears, which means it's a slow corner.\n\nAnd then, the next corner seemed pretty quick.\n\nI thought it would be Bahrain.\n\nSo, there you go.\n\nFrom, @jswallow123.\n\nI wonder why F1 drivers have to get weighed after a race.\n\nDo you know why?\n\nSo, we have a minimum weight limit\n\nof 798 kilograms, including the car.\n\nThat's why we get weighed just to make sure\n\nthat we're not under the weight limit,\n\n'cause obviously that's an advantage.\n\nWe do lose weight 'cause we're sweating,\n\nwe're working hard.\n\nDoesn't always look it, but we are.\n\nSometimes you have a very hot race, you can lose a lot.\n\nYou can lose easily three, four kilograms.\n\nThe most weight I've ever lost is probably,\n\nyeah three, three and a bit kilos.\n\nAnd yeah, often we weigh ourselves\n\nbefore the session as well,\n\nbecause then the engineers have a good idea\n\nof what we're gonna weigh so that we're not underweight\n\nin the score flight.\n\nFrom Juaann_14, What do you think\n\nis the hardest track in F1?\n\nI think Monaco.\n\nProbably Monaco.\n\nMonaco or Singapore.\n\n[Lando] Easiest one to crash.\n\n[Oscar] Yeah.\n\n[Lando] Easiest one to make mistakes.\n\nYeah.\n\nMost demanding.\n\nYou just can't make a mistake.\n\nSimple as that.\n\nYou make one little mistake, you're on the wall.\n\nThat's game over. Game over.\n\nFrom @ashlikesracing.\n\nWhat's your favorite F1 rivalry?\n\nI think for me, probably Senna versus Prost,\n\nI think it's probably the most famous one.\n\nWe are rivals.\n\nWe are rivals, yeah.\n\nI wanna beat him and he wants to be me.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut, we have to pretend that we're besties.\n\nI think we both have the same goals.\n\nWe both wanna win.\n\nThe quickest way into achieving that\n\n[Oscar] is by working together, Yeah.\n\nhelping one another.\n\nJust helping the team score the most points possible.\n\nAs soon as you put their helmet on,\n\nyou kind of fight for yourself,\n\nbut you also fight for the team.\n\nYou just have to get that balance correct.\n\nPoints, you get 25 if you win.\n\nYou get 18 if you second,\n\n15 if you're third, 12 if you're fourth.\n\nAnd then, once you get to fifth it's 10,\n\nand then it keeps dropping by twos\n\nuntil you get to 10th, you get one point.\n\nAnd then anyone finishes from 11th to 20th,\n\nthey don't get any points.\n\nYou also get a fastest lap point if you get the fastest lap.\n\nSometimes you'll see us make a bit of an unexpected pit stop\n\nor push really hard for one lap.\n\nThat's 'cause we're trying to get\n\nan extra point for the fastest lap.\n\nAnd points mean prizes And points mean prizes.\n\n[Lando] More points you get, More prizes you get,\n\nthe more money you get.\n\n@nickscotney,\n\nHow critical is a front wing in today's F1?\n\nVery. Yes.\n\n[Oscar] It's huge. Yeah.\n\nIt's like as soon as you have a little bit of damage,\n\nYou know about it.\n\nOh, you know about it straightaway.\n\nThis is it.\n\nThis is the front wing.\n\nYep.\n\nBit of the front nose.\n\nYep. And the front wing.\n\nEverything on the car is pretty much aimed\n\nat trying to push the car into ground.\n\nThat's how you get more grip.\n\nThat's down force.\n\nThat just pushes the car down, pushes the tires down,\n\n[Oscar] gives you more grip. Yeah.\n\nBasically makes you go quicker.\n\nSo, this is crucial when you're steering.\n\n[Oscar] Yep.\n\nYou take this off, you'll turn into a corner,\n\nthere's no load, there's no grip on the front tires.\n\nYou'll just go straight on.\n\nJust as important as this is, the rear wing,\n\nwhich Oscar's pre-prepared,\n\nbasically does the same thing but at the back of the car.\n\n[Oscar] Yeah. Pitches the car down,\n\ngives you a lot more rear grip.\n\nIt'll be difficult to even complete a lap.\n\nYou would spin a lot and probably crash a lot.\n\nThese are like everything to us.\n\n[Oscar] Yeah.\n\nThese are magical.\n\nThe other thing is the car is designed\n\nto have a front wing on it so the rest of,\n\nif you take the front wing off,\n\nthe rest of the car doesn't really work either.\n\nBut, the air goes through the front wing first, obviously.\n\nAnd then, it goes like to the floor.\n\nIt goes to the rear wing.\n\nSo, if you lose the front wing or the air,\n\ndoesn't get directed where it needs to go.\n\nAnd then, you have even more problems\n\nthen just losing the front wing.\n\n@Nuttymedium asks, What's the driver's visibility like?\n\nPretty bad.\n\n[Oscar] You see your car. Yeah.\n\nThe first bit of like ground that you can see like,\n\nprobably 10 meters ahead.\n\nWhen you're driving, you're kind of just focusing\n\non what's ahead of you.\n\nEven like, you know we have the halo,\n\nprotects our head, but you don't really see it\n\nbecause similar to like your nose,\n\nyou're looking far enough ahead that it kind of,\n\nyour mind just blurs it out.\n\nBut because you're looking 20 meters ahead, 30 meters ahead,\n\nand you get your own sense of gears.\n\nLike we have the gear number on our screen.\n\nMaybe you do.\n\nI never look at it. I never look at it.\n\nLike, you just do it off of sound.\n\nYou do it off of memory, Yeah.\n\noff of feeling.\n\nWhen we pull up to the pit stop sometimes\n\nand we have people all around the car,\n\nyou don't wanna hurt anyone.\n\nBut you also wanna gain\n\nevery little bit of lab time possible.\n\nSo, you push it as much as you can.\n\nBut, we still make mistakes.\n\nWe misjudge it sometimes.\n\nSometimes you kind of lock up.\n\n[Oscar] Yeah.\n\nYou hit the guy but he's ready to kind of absorb\n\na bit of the impact.\n\nAnd then he jacks the car up to change the tires,\n\nput it back down and you go.\n\nThe first time you do it, you know you enter very slowly.\n\nAnd you kind of slowly start to learn\n\nhow much you can push it, and exactly how long\n\nand why the car is.\n\nBut, that's something that takes time.\n\nWe also have like a board\n\nthat we kind of line our tires up with.\n\nSo, we have like a good reference\n\nand we can't see much out of the car\n\nbut we can see a little bit sort of the top of the tires\n\nand a little bit above that.\n\nOtherwise, you probably see a lot more people getting hit.\n\nSo, our next question is from @B4wekiss.\n\nHow do drivers know that it's time for a pit stop?\n\nOur engineer just tells us.\n\nUltimately, we can decide if we don't want to or not.\n\nUsually, there's a pretty good reason\n\nwhy they would call us into the pit lane.\n\nYou kinda pit for two reasons.\n\nActually, you can have three reasons.\n\nOne, you've got damage.\n\nTwo, the tires are wearing out.\n\nThe tire's made of rubber.\n\nOver time that wears down.\n\nThe less rubber you have, the less grip you have.\n\nSo, at a certain point it's better\n\nto come into the pits, put new tires on.\n\nThey're always talking to us about\n\nhow our tires are going, whether we think we can keep going,\n\nand if it gets really bad,\n\nwhether we can keep the car on the track.\n\nSometimes you might just pit\n\nbecause the guy behind you is pit.\n\nUndercut is when someone pits before you,\n\nputs on fresh tires and then by the time that you pit,\n\nyou actually come out behind them.\n\nOvercut, which is actually the opposite of that.\n\nYou put on fresh tires but really the fresh tires\n\naren't that much better\n\nor maybe they're difficult to warm up.\n\nIt's actually better to go for a bit longer, pit later,\n\nand maybe you overtake someone that way.\n\nThat's when you get into the more technical stuff\n\nwith strategy, which is a big part of racing.\n\nSo, there's a lot of communication around\n\nthat side of things.\n\nSo, you kind of wanna be able to communicate\n\nwith your team without giving away too much information\n\nbecause all the other teams can listen\n\nto each other's radio.\n\nIt's why you never hear anyone say\n\nwhat lap they're gonna pit,\n\n'cause then you tell the whole pit lane\n\nwhat your strategy is.\n\nFrom AmberLoungeLtd.\n\nWhat's your favorite F1 car shape?\n\nWell, we grew up watching like 2010s, or late 2000s.\n\nSo, the old cars, like Lando's holding, look really cool.\n\nMuch more simple than what we have now.\n\n[Lando] The McLaren MP4 2B 1985 Prost car.\n\n[Oscar] Yeah.\n\nI think I've driven this one.\n\nI think I drove it in Sonoma.\n\nAll right.\n\nJust everything's cool about it.\n\nYeah. Everything.\n\nThe colors, the look.\n\nSounds incredible as well.\n\nFor me, sound is a big part of everything.\n\n[Oscar] Yeah.\n\nCars nowadays, sound terrible.\n\nThese sound way better.\n\nVery little technology.\n\nEverything here is to do with technology.\n\nHow they build it, how they design it.\n\n[Oscar] Yeah.\n\nMake it, it just drives differently.\n\nVery different.\n\nNo power steering.\n\nNow, we have power steering.\n\nSo, from step one to the end,\n\nbasically everything is changed\n\nor a lot more advanced nowadays.\n\nFrom @MaybellineGrace,\n\nDo all F1 drivers have a max speed of 241 miles an hour?\n\nFastest clocked has been 241 miles an hour.\n\nIt feels pretty quick going at that speed.\n\nIt depends on the car you're in,\n\ndepends on this track,\n\ndepends if you're in a slipstream as well.\n\nIf you've got a car in front of you,\n\nliterally punches a hole in the air for you\n\nso you have less drag and you can go faster.\n\nYou don't really realize how fast you're going\n\nuntil you see like, on your dash.\n\nWe'll just hit the throttle pedal as hard as we can.\n\nIt's not down to us, it's down to the car.\n\nIt depends a lot on the track as well.\n\nHow long the straight is.\n\nSo, when we race in Monaco for example,\n\nwe race with the most amount of down force on the car.\n\nSo, the top speed is very low.\n\nBut, when we go to somewhere like Monza,\n\nwe run the lowest amount of down force.\n\nWe go much faster on the straits.\n\nFrom T_angge,\n\nHi Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.\n\nI have a question for both of you.\n\nWhat are your rituals or warmups you do\n\nbefore going onto the race?\n\nI always do like a physical warmup before the race.\n\nSome skipping, some stretches.\n\nI lie on my bed.\n\nI have a little massage.\n\nI listen to some music.\n\nThe more chilled I can be, the better.\n\nOne other thing we do\n\na few days before the race is walk the track.\n\nTo see if there's anything new\n\nthat's changed from the year before,\n\nor if it's a new circuit or a track we haven't been to.\n\nJust looking at the curbs, what things to avoid,\n\nwhat places you definitely don't wanna over push.\n\nWhat places you can push.\n\nYou know, places you don't wanna make mistakes\n\nor you can't afford to make mistakes.\n\nDifferent things like that.\n\nWe talk a lot about the strategy before the race.\n\nSo we have some plans about\n\nwhat we might wanna do in the race.\n\nIf there's one pit stop or two or three, we'll have plans\n\nthat might have different amount of pit stops.\n\nNext question we got from @samuraisofree.\n\nHow does one train become an F1 driver\n\nso that they can also have cat-like reflexes?\n\nWe trained from a very early age,\n\nbut luckily, I got a pair of balls.\n\nLet's put it to the test.\n\nI wanna test you.\n\nThere's many different ways of doing things.\n\nHere's one of them.\n\nYeah.\n\nAre you ready?\n\nAs ready as I'll ever be.\n\nUh huh.\n\nThere you go.\n\nOh!\n\nThree.\n\n[laughter]\n\nOh, you got it.\n\nEvery driver does something different.\n\nI use these lights, which come on,\n\nyou have to react to the lights.\n\nYou can also get these glasses, which like flicker.\n\nOh yeah.\n\nThis also helps your reactions a little bit more.\n\nNext question is from @bybrandonwhite.\n\nDo F1 drivers accelerate or break on curves?\n\nSo, on the corners, what's the strategy with that?\n\nNormally, you break before the corner.\n\nIf you're coming from a really long straight\n\ninto a slow corner, you need to break a lot more\n\nthan if you're coming into a fast corner\n\nor you know you're coming out of a slow corner\n\nand then you've got another corner.\n\nThat's why you see it's lock up\n\nbecause we're trying to break as much as we can.\n\nThat's the strategy with that one.\n\nSo, those are all the questions for today.\n\nThank you very much for watching Formula 1 Support.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image": "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill,d_placeholder_wired.png,fl_progressive,g_face,h_1080,q_80,w_1920/v1717695609/wired_tech-support-lando-norris-and-oscar-piastri-answer-formula-1-questions-from-twitter.jpg", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.wired.com/video/watch/tech-support-lando-norris-and-oscar-piastri-answer-formula-1-questions-from-twitter", "timestamp": "1719366058.893211", "displayed": 0}

I never look at it.\n\nLike, you just do it off of sound.\n\nYou do it off of memory, Yeah.\n\noff of feeling.\n\nWhen we pull up to the pit stop sometimes\n\nand we have people all around the car,\n\nyou don't wanna hurt anyone.\n\nBut you also wanna gain\n\nevery little bit of lab time possible.\n\nSo, you push it as much as you can.\n\nBut, we still make mistakes.\n\nWe misjudge it sometimes.\n\nSometimes you kind of lock up.\n\n[Oscar] Yeah.\n\nYou hit the guy but he's ready to kind of absorb\n\na bit of the impact.\n\nAnd then he jacks the car up to change the tires,\n\nput it back down and you go.\n\nThe first time you do it, you know you enter very slowly.\n\nAnd you kind of slowly start to learn\n\nhow much you can push it, and exactly how long\n\nand why the car is.\n\nBut, that's something that takes time.\n\nWe also have like a board\n\nthat we kind of line our tires up with.\n\nSo, we have like a good reference\n\nand we can't see much out of the car\n\nbut we can see a little bit sort of the top of the tires\n\nand a little bit above that.\n\nOtherwise, you probably see a lot more people getting hit.\n\nSo, our next question is from @B4wekiss.\n\nHow do drivers know that it's time for a pit stop?\n\nOur engineer just tells us.\n\nUltimately, we can decide if we don't want to or not.\n\nUsually, there's a pretty good reason\n\nwhy they would call us into the pit lane.\n\nYou kinda pit for two reasons.\n\nActually, you can have three reasons.\n\nOne, you've got damage.\n\nTwo, the tires are wearing out.\n\nThe tire's made of rubber.\n\nOver time that wears down.\n\nThe less rubber you have, the less grip you have.\n\nSo, at a certain point it's better\n\nto come into the pits, put new tires on.\n\nThey're always talking to us about\n\nhow our tires are going, whether we think we can keep going,\n\nand if it gets really bad,\n\nwhether we can keep the car on the track.\n\nSometimes you might just pit\n\nbecause the guy behind you is pit.\n\nUndercut is when someone pits before you,\n\nputs on fresh tires and then by the time that you pit,\n\nyou actually come out behind them.\n\nOvercut, which is actually the opposite of that.\n\nYou put on fresh tires but really the fresh tires\n\naren't that much better\n\nor maybe they're difficult to warm up.\n\nIt's actually better to go for a bit longer, pit later,\n\nand maybe you overtake someone that way.\n\nThat's when you get into the more technical stuff\n\nwith strategy, which is a big part of racing.\n\nSo, there's a lot of communication around\n\nthat side of things.\n\nSo, you kind of wanna be able to communicate\n\nwith your team without giving away too much information\n\nbecause all the other teams can listen\n\nto each other's radio.\n\nIt's why you never hear anyone say\n\nwhat lap they're gonna pit,\n\n'cause then you tell the whole pit lane\n\nwhat your strategy is.\n\nFrom AmberLoungeLtd.\n\nWhat's your favorite F1 car shape?\n\nWell, we grew up watching like 2010s, or late 2000s.\n\nSo, the old cars, like Lando's holding, look really cool.\n\nMuch more simple than what we have now.\n\n[Lando] The McLaren MP4 2B 1985 Prost car.\n\n[Oscar] Yeah.\n\nI think I've driven this one.\n\nI think I drove it in Sonoma.\n\nAll right.\n\nJust everything's cool about it.\n\nYeah. Everything.\n\nThe colors, the look.\n\nSounds incredible as well.\n\nFor me, sound is a big part of everything.\n\n[Oscar] Yeah.\n\nCars nowadays, sound terrible.\n\nThese sound way better.\n\nVery little technology.\n\nEverything here is to do with technology.\n\nHow they build it, how they design it.\n\n[Oscar] Yeah.\n\nMake it, it just drives differently.\n\nVery different.\n\nNo power steering.\n\nNow, we have power steering.\n\nSo, from step one to the end,\n\nbasically everything is changed\n\nor a lot more advanced nowadays.\n\nFrom @MaybellineGrace,\n\nDo all F1 drivers have a max speed of 241 miles an hour?\n\nFastest clocked has been 241 miles an hour.\n\nIt feels pretty quick going at that speed.\n\nIt depends on the car you're in,\n\ndepends on this track,\n\ndepends if you're in a slipstream as well.\n\nIf you've got a car in front of you,\n\nliterally punches a hole in the air for you\n\nso you have less drag and you can go faster.\n\nYou don't really realize how fast you're going\n\nuntil you see like, on your dash.\n\nWe'll just hit the throttle pedal as hard as we can.\n\nIt's not down to us, it's down to the car.\n\nIt depends a lot on the track as well.\n\nHow long the straight is.\n\nSo, when we race in Monaco for example,\n\nwe race with the most amount of down force on the car.\n\nSo, the top speed is very low.\n\nBut, when we go to somewhere like Monza,\n\nwe run the lowest amount of down force.\n\nWe go much faster on the straits.\n\nFrom T_angge,\n\nHi Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.\n\nI have a question for both of you.\n\nWhat are your rituals or warmups you do\n\nbefore going onto the race?\n\nI always do like a physical warmup before the race.\n\nSome skipping, some stretches.\n\nI lie on my bed.\n\nI have a little massage.\n\nI listen to some music.\n\nThe more chilled I can be, the better.\n\nOne other thing we do\n\na few days before the race is walk the track.\n\nTo see if there's anything new\n\nthat's changed from the year before,\n\nor if it's a new circuit or a track we haven't been to.\n\nJust looking at the curbs, what things to avoid,\n\nwhat places you definitely don't wanna over push.\n\nWhat places you can push.\n\nYou know, places you don't wanna make mistakes\n\nor you can't afford to make mistakes.\n\nDifferent things like that.\n\nWe talk a lot about the strategy before the race.\n\nSo we have some plans about\n\nwhat we might wanna do in the race.\n\nIf there's one pit stop or two or three, we'll have plans\n\nthat might have different amount of pit stops.\n\nNext question we got from @samuraisofree.\n\nHow does one train become an F1 driver\n\nso that they can also have cat-like reflexes?\n\nWe trained from a very early age,\n\nbut luckily, I got a pair of balls.\n\nLet's put it to the test.\n\nI wanna test you.\n\nThere's many different ways of doing things.\n\nHere's one of them.\n\nYeah.\n\nAre you ready?\n\nAs ready as I'll ever be.\n\nUh huh.\n\nThere you go.\n\nOh!\n\nThree.\n\n[laughter]\n\nOh, you got it.\n\nEvery driver does something different.\n\nI use these lights, which come on,\n\nyou have to react to the lights.\n\nYou can also get these glasses, which like flicker.\n\nOh yeah.\n\nThis also helps your reactions a little bit more.\n\nNext question is from @bybrandonwhite.\n\nDo F1 drivers accelerate or break on curves?\n\nSo, on the corners, what's the strategy with that?\n\nNormally, you break before the corner.\n\nIf you're coming from a really long straight\n\ninto a slow corner, you need to break a lot more\n\nthan if you're coming into a fast corner\n\nor you know you're coming out of a slow corner\n\nand then you've got another corner.\n\nThat's why you see it's lock up\n\nbecause we're trying to break as much as we can.\n\nThat's the strategy with that one.\n\nSo, those are all the questions for today.\n\nThank you very much for watching Formula 1 Support.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image": "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill,d_placeholder_wired.png,fl_progressive,g_face,h_1080,q_80,w_1920/v1717695609/wired_tech-support-lando-norris-and-oscar-piastri-answer-formula-1-questions-from-twitter.jpg", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.wired.com/video/watch/tech-support-lando-norris-and-oscar-piastri-answer-formula-1-questions-from-twitter", "timestamp": "1719366059.596552", "displayed": 0}

Island and Staten Island,\n\n'cause my moms, we moved to Staten Island\n\nfrom Brooklyn, actually.\n\nA place where you couldn't stay too long,\n\nkind of like a shelter, but not a shelter.\n\nThe lady that was one of the people that worked there,\n\nher and my mom got really tight\n\nand that's how we ended up in Staten Island.\n\nLong Island, I was born there,\n\nso always got a place in my heart\n\nfor Hempstead, Long Island as a whole, period.\n\nMethod Man, Da Rockwilder.\n\nThis record done by the person we named it after,\n\nI wanted to name it after him, show homage,\n\ncame up through the ranks with Eric Sherman, Redman,\n\nand those guys.\n\nRedman didn't like the record.\n\nIt wasn't that he didn't like the record,\n\nhe knew that Rockwilder could do way better,\n\n'cause like I said, they all came up through those ranks.\n\nSo he was a little bit harder on Rockwilder,\n\nbut it turned out to be a hit.\n\nRockwilder, microphone checker.\n\nMethod man Jay-Z tour.\n\nWell it was actually the Hard Knock Life Tour,\n\nyes, it was definitely Jay-Z's tour.\n\nShout out to Jay-Z, you're doing magnificent things, man,\n\nbig things for hip hop as well as our culture as a whole.\n\nWhen we were asked to go on that, we knew what it entailed,\n\nwe knew who the artists were.\n\nI mean DMX, Jay-Z, you know, those are heavyweights.\n\nSo myself and Redman being that we were already veterans\n\nin the game, we kind of fit right in.\n\nAnd plus, I'm pretty sure Jay knew what me and Redman\n\nwere capable of doing on stage,\n\nand it was a very successful tour.\n\nWe did 54 dates, all of 'em sold out, there was even,\n\nI mean, we was getting so much money\n\nwhen the thing happened in Columbine,\n\neverybody donated their paycheck,\n\nor rather their show money to that cause\n\nfor the kids that lost lives.\n\nWe probably would've did it anyway,\n\neven if we weren't getting money,\n\n'cause a sign of the times that's what it is.\n\nBut yeah, it was a pretty lucrative tour for everybody.\n\nMethod man, The Riddler, loved this record.\n\nActually the guitar riff is played by\n\nOld Dirty Brasstards' older brother.\n\nNot too many people know that, fun fact.\n\nwe did this in The RZA's basement before the flood.\n\nYou know, us Blerds, us black nerds,\n\nwe love our comic books.\n\nAnd when the opportunity presented itself, The Riddler.\n\nI knew off top that I wanted to do a bad guy song.\n\nThe riff that Old Dirty Brasstards' brother came up with\n\nwas perfect.\n\nAnd I believe The Riddler played\n\na major part in that album,\n\nthe whole soundtrack going 10 times platinum.\n\nI like to say that in my head,\n\nbut it was really Seal, Kiss from a Rose,\n\nand, U2, U2, U2 had a great record on there as well.\n\nYeah, The Riddler.\n\nBam.\n\nWhat's Happenin', Method Man.\n\nI don't know, chilling.\n\nActually that's a song that picked me.\n\nBusta had a record and he came to me and he was like,\n\nyou need this record, lord.\n\nAnd when Busta tell you you need a record,\n\nyou need a record.\n\nAnd it became the first single.\n\nSo yeah, What's Happenin'.\n\nWhat does tical mean?\n\nTical can mean a lot of things,\n\nbut right now it means the top is cold and lonely.\n\nWell, I mean it came from a word we used to use\n\nto describe trees, plants, flower.\n\nIt was a word made up by a friend\n\naround my way named Lounging Low.\n\nIt took on its own life,\n\nso yeah, tical means a lot of things,\n\nbut right now the top is cold and lonely.\n\nWhat the Blood Clot, Method Man.\n\nI was actually mad at the Clan when I wrote that record.\n\nI was on the airplane playing my radio at that right,\n\ntimes have changed, they would never let me do that now.\n\nBut I was playing my radio\n\nand I kept rewinding an Eric Sherman record called\n\nIt's All In The Mind,\n\nthat's what I wrote What The Blood Clot to.\n\nI remember 'cause we got into a big argument\n\nbefore we got on the plane and I was just mad at all of 'em.\n\nLike Wu-tang Clan ain't nothing to [beep] with,\n\n[beep] you guys.\n\nThe What, Method Man, Biggie.\n\nThis is crazy too, because I actually snuck\n\nto go do this record with Biggie,\n\nTracey Waples, salute to Traywap.\n\nShe came and scooped me up that night\n\nand like I said, I wasn't supposed to be doing any records\n\nwith anybody, I had my own album coming.\n\nWu-Tang had steam and we wanted to keep that in home,\n\nand the money as well.\n\nSo I went and did the Biggie record, Big was mad cool.\n\nContrary to what everybody believes,\n\nhe wrote his rhyme right there when I wrote mine.\n\nNobody was doing anything inside their head.\n\nAnd it was a fun time, man, The What, Method Man,\n\nBiggie, Brooklyn.\n\nAll right, I got me embellishing too much.\n\nIs Method Man in Power?\n\nYes, I'm in Power.\n\nI play Davis MacLean on Power, very savvy lawyer.\n\nAnybody that follows the Power universe\n\nknow that lawyers don't fare too well on this show.\n\nSo I think the fact that Davis is still alive\n\nfor this fourth and final season\n\nsays a lot about his character and a lot about me.\n\nIs Method Man in Trainwreck?\n\nYes, I'm in Trainwreck,\n\nhad a lot of fun with the old cat Norman,\n\nI forgot his last name, but he's been around forever.\n\nHe was actually in the scene with me, he was the older cat,\n\nthat used to talk about Babe Ruth all day.\n\nFirst time working with Judd Apatow, not my first time, no,\n\nas a matter of fact,\n\nit wasn't my first time working with him.\n\nI actually read for the movie he did with Adam Sandler\n\nthat RZA got.\n\nBut Judd said that it is his life's mission\n\nto have every Wu-Tang member in at least one of his films.\n\nSo he's got two down, he's got about seven more to go.\n\nTrainwreck, dope.\n\nShout out to Amy Schumer, hey muffin.\n\nIs Method Man a Jets fan?\n\nAbso-freaking-lutely.\n\nI'm a Long Island kid, I mean we grew up on Jets and Mets.\n\nNot too big on basketball, but Jets and Mets\n\nwere always synonymous with Long Island, Queens,\n\nyou know what I'm saying?\n\nNew York Sack Exchange, those guys,\n\nI mean even Richard Todd, you know what I mean?\n\nHe was my guy for a minute.\n\nWesley Walker, Freeman McNeil, the Big Tuna.\n\nWe had Keyshawn for a while, Rob Moore, who I grew up with,\n\nRob Moore was a wide receiver for the team.\n\nSo yeah, I've been a Jets fan for life.\n\nSalute.\n\nWhere did Method Man get his name?\n\nTook it from a [beep].\n\nNah, actually, it's a block name, like I said,\n\nwe had different terminology for trees\n\nand Method was one of the terms that we used\n\nto describe trees and I felt like the man.\n\nSo yeah, Method Man, just fit.\n\nIs Method Man in The Wire?\n\nYes, I am in The Wire,' but I am not wired\n\n'cause I'm no snitch.\n\nI actually played a character called\n\nMelvin Cheese Wagstaff, nephew of Prop Joe.\n\nCheese was a piece of work, I think Cheese was a survivor,\n\nbut anybody that watched the show\n\nwould think he's a piece of [beep].\n\nI won't give any spoilers away,\n\nbut he does something that's against code\n\nand he deserved everything that he got.\n\nIs Method Man going on tour?\n\nNo sir, Method Man is more focused on acting,\n\nthat is first position for me.\n\nSo unless the movie is about a tour,\n\nMethod Man will not be on tour anytime soon.\n\nBut we do actually have a residency in Vegas, Wu-Tang.\n\nIf you can catch it, come out, it's pretty fun.\n\nYou know, bring you and your old lady, no kids.\n\nMethod Man, best songs.\n\nI got one, one that I think is my best song\n\nand it's definitely All I Need, of course.\n\nGot me a Grammy.\n\nIt actually was Mary's first Grammy,\n\nshe's gotten plenty more after that as she should.\n\nThe fact that it was a song that I didn't even wanna put out\n\nand it did what it did,\n\njust shows how much I know about music.\n\n[Interviewer] Why didn't you wanna put it out?\n\nIn my eyes, it wasn't a traditional love song,\n\nbut it was still a love song, which wasn't in my idea,\n\nsomething that I wanted to put out at that point in time.\n\nLook, keep Googling, stop with whatever, man.\n\nI don't even entertain any of that [beep].\n\nY'all be good, stay outta trouble.\n\n[upbeat music]", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image":

actually have a residency in Vegas, Wu-Tang.\n\nIf you can catch it, come out, it's pretty fun.\n\nYou know, bring you and your old lady, no kids.\n\nMethod Man, best songs.\n\nI got one, one that I think is my best song\n\nand it's definitely All I Need, of course.\n\nGot me a Grammy.\n\nIt actually was Mary's first Grammy,\n\nshe's gotten plenty more after that as she should.\n\nThe fact that

it?\n\nI hate to break it to you,\n\nthat these things are really just glorified laxatives.\n\nSo what's happening is that\n\nyou're speeding up your digestive process\n\nbeyond what it should be normally.\n\nBut what you're flushing out is\n\nfood that you haven't finished digesting properly\n\nand absorbing their nutrients.\n\nSo you're creating a lot of diarrhea,\n\nand you're also dehydrating yourself.\n\nSo while you might feel like you have a very flat tummy,\n\nit's not because you're actually losing weight\n\nor removing toxins, it's simply because you've removed food\n\nto quickly from your body, and you're dehydrating yourself.\n\n@itssynecdoche is asking, why am I only just learning\n\nthat chiropractors are not real doctors?\n\nYeah.\n\nSo chiropractic is a $15 billion industry,\n\nand it was invented by a guy named Didi Palmer\n\nwho thought that ghosts were telling him to create it.\n\nThey believe that the joints and the nerves\n\nthat go through our body are the cause of every ailment\n\nthat we know of.\n\nUnfortunately, chiropractic is a full-on pseudoscience.\n\nThere are certain chiropractors\n\nthat maybe stay in the lane of more physical therapy,\n\nand there's a little bit of data to suggest that\n\nfor certain types of low back pain,\n\nchiropractic adjustment can offer temporary relief,\n\nbut it's not fixing a musculoskeletal problem,\n\nand it's definitely not doing\n\nthe other things that chiropractors claim to do.\n\nSo if you see the abbreviation DC\n\nafter someone's name on social media,\n\nthat means that they're a chiropractor,\n\nand they're not a medical or scientific expert.\n\n@pathogenflock, is it just me,\n\nor is belief in pseudoscience rising recently?\n\nThis is absolutely correct.\n\nWe have seen a dramatic rise in anti-science\n\nand pseudoscience beliefs,\n\nand this does trend with the prevalence of social media.\n\nAlso coincides with the recent Covid-19 pandemic\n\nand the increasing amount of politicization of vaccines.\n\nSo this past year,\n\nonly 93.1% of entering school age children\n\nreceived vaccinations for the MMR,\n\nthe measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.\n\nThis is a 2% drop compared to the previous school year,\n\nparticularly for a disease where you need\n\nat least 95% coverage to stop the spread of measles,\n\nthis is a very concerning trend.\n\n@gutznotguts wants to know\n\nhow the [bleep] did the vaccines cause autism myth\n\neven start?\n\nThis myth started in 1998\n\nbecause of a British gastroenterologist\n\nnamed Andrew Wakefield,\n\nwho has since lost his medical license\n\nand the ability to practice medicine.\n\nBut he published a paper in The Lancet,\n\nwhich is a very prestigious medical journal,\n\nand claimed that he had data to demonstrate\n\na link between the MMR vaccine,\n\nwhich is the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine\n\nand autism symptoms in children.\n\nThe problem was he falsified all of the data in that paper.\n\nMore than that, he used self-reports from parents\n\nwho were planning to sue the existing manufacturers\n\nof the MMR vaccine.\n\nOn top of that, he was trying to sell\n\nand market his own MMR vaccine,\n\nbut because it was published\n\nin such prestigious medical journal,\n\nit took the world by storm, it caused a lot of fear.\n\nEventually that paper was retracted,\n\nbut that retraction did not occur until 2010,\n\n12 years later.\n\nNow, in recent years, we're seeing measles rates\n\nabove what we have ever seen in the US,\n\nand it is really a cause for concern\n\nbecause the very first measles vaccine\n\nwas put on the market in 1963.\n\nSo we have over 60 years of data\n\nthat demonstrate that there is no relationship\n\nbetween vaccines and autism.\n\n@briney4trump, GMOs change our DNA every day\n\nand give people several diseases.\n\nWhy did we approve of this?\n\nThis is not true.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the papaya was being wiped out\n\nby a virus called the papaya ring spot virus.\n\nSo we created a GMO papaya\n\nthat can resist the papaya ring spot virus.\n\n90% of the papayas are GMO.\n\nAnd when you eat them, it is not changing your DNA.\n\nSo when you eat the papaya, you're eating all of its cells\n\nand all of those cells contain DNA.\n\nSo those DNA molecules are going to enter your stomach\n\nand it's gonna mix with an enzyme called pepsin.\n\nSo when the pepsin interacts with the DNA molecule,\n\nit blasted apart into all of these individual subunits,\n\nand therefore the DNA is no longer intact.\n\nIt's not gonna change your DNA,\n\nit's not gonna cause any harmful consequences.\n\n@JohnnyV45385760 wants to know,\n\nhow can you tell if a health influencer is legit\n\nor full of shit?\n\nSome of the red flags to look for are, number one,\n\nthey are trying to evoke very strong negative emotions.\n\nThings like fear, anxiety, or worry,\n\nparticularly as it relates to your health\n\nor the health of your children or your family.\n\nNumber two, they're making all or none statements.\n\nThey're saying that this thing is causing cancer,\n\nor this thing is going to fix some disorder.\n\nNumber three, if they're selling you something\n\nthat is related to the claims that they're making,\n\nwhether that is a supplement, or a diet plan,\n\nor a protocol, or a book.\n\nNumber four, if they have an obvious conflict of interest.\n\nAre they working for the company\n\nof the product that they're selling you?\n\nAnd last but not least, if they're speaking way outside\n\nof their area of expertise.\n\nIf someone is a neuroscientist\n\nthat specializes in optic nerve signaling,\n\nand they're pretending to be an expert\n\nin infectious disease immunology,\n\nthat's probably a red flag.\n\n@10000problems wants to know\n\nwhy does homeopathic medicine work\n\nso much better than real medicine?\n\nUnfortunately that is not the case.\n\nBut let me tell you a little bit about what homeopathy is,\n\n'cause it's often confused with\n\nother sorts of alternative remedies.\n\nHomeopathy is a pseudoscience that was created\n\nor invented in the 1700s by a German guy\n\nnamed Samuel Hahnemann.\n\nHe created this based on two beliefs.\n\nThe first is that like cures like,\n\nmeaning that if something causes a symptom,\n\nthat same substance can cure\n\nan ailment that creates that symptom.\n\nOnion causes watery eyes when you cut it.\n\nTherefore, homeopathic onion\n\nis going to cure things like allergies\n\nthat also cause watery eyes.\n\nBut that goes along with the second belief,\n\nor the law of infinite decimals.\n\nMeaning that the remedy becomes more potent\n\nthe more it is diluted.\n\nIf you find a label on a homeopathic remedy\n\nthat says 12C, C means 100, and 12 means that you've diluted\n\nthe substance 12 times a hundred fold over,\n\nwhich means you have one part in this many parts,\n\nwhich is also called one septillion.\n\nSo what that means is that\n\nthere's no actual active ingredient in that.\n\nThat is probably a good thing\n\nbecause there are many homeopathic remedies\n\nthat can be very dangerous\n\nif you would ingest them at normal dosage.\n\nFor example, teething tablets\n\nthat claim to have homeopathic belladonna,\n\nwhich is deadly nightshade,\n\nwere contaminated with measurable levels of belladonna,\n\nand hundreds of babies developed seizures,\n\nand at least 10 babies died.\n\nThis happened starting in 2010 and 2012,\n\nand there were several brands that were to blame.\n\nOne final danger of homeopathy is that\n\nmany people believe that they're taking something\n\nthat's beneficial, and beyond the fact that it is\n\nnothing more than a sugar pill,\n\nit often leads people to forego actual medical care,\n\nwhich is one of the biggest harms of all.\n\n@paul_metta555 asks,\n\nare cell phone towers detrimental to our health?\n\nWhy so many?\n\nWhy do they emit high pitch noises?\n\nAre they carcinogenic?\n\nWhy the spiking cancer rates since they arrived?\n\nCell phone towers look like this.\n\nYou have this primary node that's coming out from all sides,\n\nand you have these radio waves that are being emitted.\n\nYou also have these secondary nodes\n\nthat are a little bit smaller,\n\nbut all of these radio frequency waves\n\nare projected in every direction,\n\nbecause otherwise we wouldn't have cell reception.\n\nSo this myth kind of started because people heard the word\n\nradiofrequency radiation and got scared,\n\nbecause we know that there are certain types of radiation\n\nthat are linked to cancer.\n\nHere we have the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nThings on this end are very high energy,\n\nand this rainbow right here is our visible light spectrum.\n\nUltraviolet and above, these types of radiation\n\ncan potentially damage our cells in our body,\n\nand can lead to changes in our cells and mutations.\n\nBut when you get below the energy level of visible light\n\nand you get into infrared and microwaves, way down here,\n\nthose are your radio waves.\n\nSo this radio frequency radiation\n\nis one of the lowest energy types of radiation,\n\nand it's considered what we call non-ionizing,\n\nmeaning it cannot penetrate your body.\n\nSo even if those radio waves are all over our planet,\n\nbecause we have cell reception everywhere,\n\nthe amount of energy that they're exerting\n\nis not actually going to damage your body\n\nor cause you any potential harm.\n\n@JohnPetersonFW wants to know, I'd really like to know,\n\nfrom someone that actually knows\n\nif buying organic food for double the price\n\nis actually worth it/better for you.\n\nThe biggest misconception is that organic is pesticide free.\n\nHere we have organic blueberries.\n\nThey are grown using organic pesticides\n\nand organic pesticides are simply chemicals\n\nthat have not been synthetically altered\n\nfrom the original state in which they exist\n\nsomewhere in nature.\n\nIn contrast, these are conventional blueberries\n\nwho were grown using conventional pesticides.\n\nConventional pesticides are those that can be\n\nsynthetically altered in order to improve their specificity.\n\nA 2010 study in PLoS One was looking at\n\nsix different pesticides that are used to control aphids\n\non soybean plants.\n\nIt was found to not only control aphids,\n\nbut it also killed the natural predators of the aphids,\n\nthe insidious flower bug, and the Asian lady beetle,\n\nhaving a more broad negative ecological impact.\n\nAnother misconception about all produce\n\nis that they have all these residues of pesticides on them.\n\nWe're talking about parts per trillion, parts per billion.\n\nThese are minuscule levels.\n\nIf you're very concerned about it, absolutely.\n\nWash your produce in water.\n\nBut aside from that,\n\nyou don't need to be stressing about your produce.\n\n@ToyaRochelle wants to know,\n\nwhat do people think they're cleansing\n\nwhen they do juice and smoothie cleanses or detoxes?\n\nBut I hate to break it to you,\n\nif you have functioning organ systems,\n\nyou're already detoxing all day every day.\n\nSo when people say that they're doing a parasite cleanse\n\nor a cleanse and they're claiming that these stringy things\n\nin their poop is parasite parse,\n\nwhat they're actually seeing is mucus\n\nand sloughed off intestinal cells,\n\nwhich is not a good thing,\n\nit's actually harming your GI tract.\n\n@bigpapabriggs wants to know, on a scale from one to 10,\n\nhow scared should I be of Lyme disease?\n\nSo as someone who's actually studied Lyme disease\n\nfor several decades,\n\nLyme disease is actually not as easy to get as you think.\n\nNot only do you have to have the right species of tick\n\nactually bite you, but it has to feed on you\n\nfor at least 24 hours\n\nin order to have a chance to transmit the bacteria for you.\n\nYour likelihood or risk of getting Lyme disease\n\nis very, very low.\n\nScale of one to 10, I would give it about a two or a three.\n\nThere's only two species of ticks in the US\n\nthat can transmit Lyme disease.\n\nThere are some areas in the country\n\nthat you have higher risk,\n\nlike the Midwest and the Northeast,\n\nand this is because you have higher proportions of\n\nboth the ticks that live there\n\nand the bacteria in those ticks.\n\nIn other parts of the country, the risk is almost zero.\n\nThere are a lot of common myths about Lyme disease.\n\nThe first is that once you're infected,\n\nyou're always gonna be infected, and that is just not true.\n\nIt's a bacterial infection,\n\nand once you've taken antibiotics for standard course\n\nor very effective treatments,\n\nyou're going to eliminate the bacteria.\n\nBut unfortunately, since it was discovered in the 1980s,\n\nit has really been the target of a lot of misinformation.\n\nAnd that can be attributed partially to some of these tests\n\nthat are sold direct to consumer,\n\nthat claim to be able to diagnose you with Lyme disease.\n\nUnfortunately, these tests are not FDA approved,\n\nand are not accurate, but they tell people\n\nthat they have Lyme disease when in reality they do not.\n\nSo it creates the perception that Lyme disease\n\nis not only more widespread than it is,\n\nbut is much more prevalent and severe.\n\n@RetiredDent, I'm seeing more and more parents\n\ngiving their children non fluoridated toothpaste.\n\nWhat's up with that?\n\nWhy are people so afraid of fluoride?\n\nWell, fluoride is a naturally occurring substance\n\nthat can be found in minerals and soil,\n\nand in our environment.\n\nAnd it was determined many, many years ago that communities\n\nthat had naturally higher levels of fluoride in their water\n\nwe're less likely to develop cavities.\n\nSo we started fluoridating water\n\nand adding fluoride to toothpaste over 75 years ago,\n\nand that's really plummeted\n\nthe amount of dental caries or cavities.\n\nUnfortunately claims on social media\n\nthat are not based on reality,\n\ntell people that fluoride is a neurotoxin.\n\nWhat they don't mention is that the dosage\n\nat which you'd have to consume fluoride\n\nin order to have any toxic effect\n\nis well outside of the reality\n\nof anything you could possibly consume.\n\nFluoride in water is added at 0.7 milligrams per kilogram,\n\nwhich means that in order to hit the minimum threshold\n\nwhere you might have skeletal effects from fluoride,\n\nif you were a child weighing 22 pounds,\n\nyou'd have to drink 57 liters of water a day.\n\nSo it really is not a concern.\n\n@karinefrigon says,\n\neverybody should have a gluten-free diet, I'm just saying.\n\nThe reality is if you don't have a medical reason\n\nto avoid gluten, you don't need to avoid gluten.\n\nGluten is a structural protein\n\nthat's found in certain grains like wheat,\n\nbarley, rosin and others.\n\nAnd there are certain medical conditions\n\nthat you should avoid this particular protein.\n\nThis would be something like celiac disease,\n\nwhich is an autoimmune disorder.\n\nThere's been a lot of studies\n\nin whether or not avoiding gluten offers a benefit,\n\nand the big consensus is is that it doesn't.\n\nSometimes we hear claims that the gluten here is worse\n\nbecause we use all the processed chemicals\n\nand we use all the pesticides.\n\nAnd when you went to Europe,\n\nyou were able to eat all the bread you wanted\n\nand you didn't have those issues with the gluten.\n\nAnd unfortunately, the gluten quantity in wheats\n\nacross countries is essentially the same.\n\nOn top of that, we also use the same pesticides.\n\nGlyphosate is one that's often demonized\n\nbecause it's used to dry down wheat,\n\nbut it's also used in Europe.\n\nEurope imports millions of pounds of American wheat\n\nevery year to make the very breads that you're eating.\n\nI would suggest that maybe you're more relaxed\n\nwhile you're on vacation,\n\nand you're not gulping down your food\n\nin between bringing kids to activities and swallowing air,\n\nleading to the perceived feeling of bloat,\n\nwhich has nothing to do with the gluten,\n\nbut everything to do with the rushing\n\nand the stress that you have with your day-to-day life.\n\n@TealePB wants to know what makes a study,\n\nany study, reliable?\n\nSo when we talk about the scientific method,\n\nwe have what we call the hierarchy of evidence.\n\nAt the bottom, you have things that are generally based\n\non small sample sizes or opinions.\n\nFrom there, you're going into animal trials\n\nand in vitro data.\n\nSo these are your Petri dish studies, or your animal data\n\nthat are not automatically representative\n\nof what's happening in people.\n\nSay you wanna study a disease process in humans\n\nand you use an animal model\n\nthat that disease doesn't occur in,\n\nthat's not going to be an accurate\n\nor representative research model,\n\nbecause it's not going to give you data\n\nthat you can then generalize to people.\n\nOnce you get above that, you're moving into human studies.\n\nRandomized controlled trials, they're usually also blinded.\n\nThose are considered our gold standard,\n\nso with vaccine studies, this is very common.\n\nThere is a group of people that receive the placebo,\n\nwhich is usually salt water,\n\nand there are people that received the vaccine.\n\nNone of them know what they received,\n\nyou might report different symptoms than if you knew\n\nyou were getting the placebo.\n\nAt the very top, you have what we call meta-analyses\n\nand systematic reviews.\n\nThese are analyses where we take multiple studies\n\nand we pool them and analyze them together.\n\nThere are really high quality journals like JAMA,\n\nwhich is the Journal of the American Medical Association\n\nor PNAS, which is the Proceedings\n\nof the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nBut as a rule of thumb, if you're trying to find information\n\non a given topic, you wanna look for at the minimum,\n\nthat it is indeed peer reviewed,\n\nand that it is aligning with other topics\n\nor other papers that are in that field.\n\nIt is very, very unlikely that one study\n\nis going to displace the thousands of other studies\n\nwithin a given field or topic.\n\nWe call that cherry picking.\n\n@WishWellTherapy wants know,\n\nstudy after study has revealed that aspartame,\n\nsucralose, and saccharin lead to cancer\n\nand other disorders of the cells and organ.\n\nSaccharin was actually banned temporarily in the US,\n\nbecause there was thought to be a relationship\n\nbetween saccharin and bladder cancer.\n\nIt turns out that the studies they were using\n\nwere using a type of rat.\n\nThese rats had a genetic predisposition\n\nthat they developed these bladder crystals,\n\nand made them more likely to develop tumors.\n\nNot only were we using rats that were not an appropriate\n\nor realistic research model, these rats were being fed\n\nclose to 10% of their body weight per day in saccharin.\n\nAnd it was at that point that a proportion of the male rats\n\ndeveloped bladder cancers.\n\nFollow-up studies using rhesus macaques, mice,\n\nand looking at human data have demonstrated\n\nthat saccharin is not related to cancer in humans at all,\n\nand so the ban was lifted.\n\nBut ultimately that stigma related to saccharin\n\nhas actually transferred to other artificial sweeteners.\n\n@flyrodu asks, how do we know that supplements work?\n\nIs there any real research on all these supplements\n\nthat exist?\n\nE.G, athletic greens, et cetera?\n\nSo in the United States alone,\n\nthe dietary supplement industry\n\nis worth nearly $160 billion.\n\nUnlike FDA approved medications,\n\nsupplements do not have to prove that they are helping\n\nor offering a benefit.\n\nA lot of people may take powdered vitamin C\n\nand mix it into their water\n\nwhen they feel like they have a cold or a flu coming on.\n\nVitamin C supplementation doesn't reduce the duration\n\nof respiratory illnesses,\n\nit doesn't lessen the severity of them,\n\nit doesn't prevent them.\n\nThere's been a lot of studies, especially in recent years\n\nthat have been looking at\n\nthe benefits of vitamin D supplement.\n\nSo this one assessed the efficacy of vitamin D and zinc\n\nin combination to improve outcomes of Covid-19.\n\nAnd ultimately what these show is that\n\nvitamin D supplementation did not lessen disease severity,\n\ndid not reduce hospital stay,\n\ndid not reduce severity of symptoms,\n\nand did not improve mortality outcomes.\n\nAnd there was a study that actually found over 50%\n\nof immune boosting supplements\n\nwere lying about what was in the product.\n\nAnd worse, some were not\n\nmentioning things that were in them.\n\n@pennebykameron wants to know,\n\nis there scientific evidence of crystals\n\nbefore and after charging?\n\nMany people believe that crystals have energetic powers,\n\nthat the crystal, or the energy in the crystal\n\nis vibrating with your own personal energy.\n\nAnd unfortunately there have been no studies\n\nthat have suggested that this is a true relationship.\n\nIt is likely nothing more than the placebo effect.\n\nThe placebo effect can be very strong.\n\nThere is a body of data that suggests that in some instances\n\npeople can feel like they're recovering\n\nfrom things more quickly or that their symptoms\n\nor side effects are lower\n\nbecause they have that power of the placebo.\n\nSo we don't wanna discount the placebo effect,\n\nbut we certainly don't want it to replace\n\nactual science-based medicine.\n\n@Janani802 wants to know, can fasting help cancer patients?\n\nSo this claim is really pervasive,\n\nand as someone who works in cancer research\n\nis really harmful for a lot of reasons,\n\nand it kind of breaks my heart.\n\nThis claim originated from in vitro studies,\n\nor Petri dish studies where we are growing cancer cells.\n\nAnd what they found was depriving them of nutrients,\n\nor simulating fasting cause the cancer cells to die.\n\nBut what that fails to account for is that\n\nany cell deprived of nutrient is going to fail to grow.\n\nAnd what happening in a piece of plastic\n\nor a plastic dish like this,\n\nis not what is happening inside the complex being of a human\n\nwho has cancer.\n\nFasting can actually be harmful if you're battling cancer,\n\n'cause you're depriving yourself and your body\n\nof very essential nutrients and calories that you need\n\nfor your immune system to do its best work.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nAlways be skeptical when you encounter things\n\nthat may not be as they seem.\n\nThanks for

compared to the previous school year,\n\nparticularly for a disease where you need\n\nat least 95% coverage to stop the spread of measles,\n\nthis is a very concerning trend.\n\n@gutznotguts wants to know\n\nhow the [bleep] did the vaccines cause autism myth\n\neven start?\n\nThis myth started in 1998\n\nbecause of a British gastroenterologist\n\nnamed Andrew Wakefield,\n\nwho has since lost his medical license\n\nand the ability to practice medicine.\n\nBut he published a paper in The Lancet,\n\nwhich is a very prestigious medical journal,\n\nand claimed that he had data to demonstrate\n\na link between the MMR vaccine,\n\nwhich is the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine\n\nand autism symptoms in children.\n\nThe problem was he falsified all of the data in that paper.\n\nMore than that, he used self-reports from parents\n\nwho were planning to sue the existing manufacturers\n\nof the MMR vaccine.\n\nOn top of that, he was trying to sell\n\nand market his own MMR vaccine,\n\nbut because it was published\n\nin such prestigious medical journal,\n\nit took the world by storm, it caused a lot of fear.\n\nEventually that paper was retracted,\n\nbut that retraction did not occur until 2010,\n\n12 years later.\n\nNow, in recent years, we're seeing measles rates\n\nabove what we have ever seen in the US,\n\nand it is really a cause for concern\n\nbecause the very first measles vaccine\n\nwas put on the market in 1963.\n\nSo we have over 60 years of data\n\nthat demonstrate that there is no relationship\n\nbetween vaccines and autism.\n\n@briney4trump, GMOs change our DNA every day\n\nand give people several diseases.\n\nWhy did we approve of this?\n\nThis is not true.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the papaya was being wiped out\n\nby a virus called the papaya ring spot virus.\n\nSo we created a GMO papaya\n\nthat can resist the papaya ring spot virus.\n\n90% of the papayas are GMO.\n\nAnd when you eat them, it is not changing your DNA.\n\nSo when you eat the papaya, you're eating all of its cells\n\nand all of those cells contain DNA.\n\nSo those DNA molecules are going to enter your stomach\n\nand it's gonna mix with an enzyme called pepsin.\n\nSo when the pepsin interacts with the DNA molecule,\n\nit blasted apart into all of these individual subunits,\n\nand therefore the DNA is no longer intact.\n\nIt's not gonna change your DNA,\n\nit's not gonna cause any harmful consequences.\n\n@JohnnyV45385760 wants to know,\n\nhow can you tell if a health influencer is legit\n\nor full of shit?\n\nSome of the red flags to look for are, number one,\n\nthey are trying to evoke very strong negative emotions.\n\nThings like fear, anxiety, or worry,\n\nparticularly as it relates to your health\n\nor the health of your children or your family.\n\nNumber two, they're making all or none statements.\n\nThey're saying that this thing is causing cancer,\n\nor this thing is going to fix some disorder.\n\nNumber three, if they're selling you something\n\nthat is related to the claims that they're making,\n\nwhether that is a supplement, or a diet plan,\n\nor a protocol, or a book.\n\nNumber four, if they have an obvious conflict of interest.\n\nAre they working for the company\n\nof the product that they're selling you?\n\nAnd last but not least, if they're speaking way outside\n\nof their area of expertise.\n\nIf someone is a neuroscientist\n\nthat specializes in optic nerve signaling,\n\nand they're pretending to be an expert\n\nin infectious disease immunology,\n\nthat's probably a red flag.\n\n@10000problems wants to know\n\nwhy does homeopathic medicine work\n\nso much better than real medicine?\n\nUnfortunately that is not the case.\n\nBut let me tell you a little bit about what homeopathy is,\n\n'cause it's often confused with\n\nother sorts of alternative remedies.\n\nHomeopathy is a pseudoscience that was created\n\nor invented in the 1700s by a German guy\n\nnamed Samuel Hahnemann.\n\nHe created this based on two beliefs.\n\nThe first is that like cures like,\n\nmeaning that if something causes a symptom,\n\nthat same substance can cure\n\nan ailment that creates that symptom.\n\nOnion causes watery eyes when you cut it.\n\nTherefore, homeopathic onion\n\nis going to cure things like allergies\n\nthat also cause watery eyes.\n\nBut that goes along with the second belief,\n\nor the law of infinite decimals.\n\nMeaning that the remedy becomes more potent\n\nthe more it is diluted.\n\nIf you find a label on a homeopathic remedy\n\nthat says 12C, C means 100, and 12 means that you've diluted\n\nthe substance 12 times a hundred fold over,\n\nwhich means you have one part in this many parts,\n\nwhich is also called one septillion.\n\nSo what that means is that\n\nthere's no actual active ingredient in that.\n\nThat is probably a good thing\n\nbecause there are many homeopathic remedies\n\nthat can be very dangerous\n\nif you would ingest them at normal dosage.\n\nFor example, teething tablets\n\nthat claim to have homeopathic belladonna,\n\nwhich is deadly nightshade,\n\nwere contaminated with measurable levels of belladonna,\n\nand hundreds of babies developed seizures,\n\nand at least 10 babies died.\n\nThis happened starting in 2010 and 2012,\n\nand there were several brands that were to blame.\n\nOne final danger of homeopathy is that\n\nmany people believe that they're taking something\n\nthat's beneficial, and beyond the fact that it is\n\nnothing more than a sugar pill,\n\nit often leads people to forego actual medical care,\n\nwhich is one of the biggest harms of all.\n\n@paul_metta555 asks,\n\nare cell phone towers detrimental to our health?\n\nWhy so many?\n\nWhy do they emit high pitch noises?\n\nAre they carcinogenic?\n\nWhy the spiking cancer rates since they arrived?\n\nCell phone towers look like this.\n\nYou have this primary node that's coming out from all sides,\n\nand you have these radio waves that are being emitted.\n\nYou also have these secondary nodes\n\nthat are a little bit smaller,\n\nbut all of these radio frequency waves\n\nare projected in every direction,\n\nbecause otherwise we wouldn't have cell reception.\n\nSo this myth kind of started because people heard the word\n\nradiofrequency radiation and got scared,\n\nbecause we know that there are certain types of radiation\n\nthat are linked to cancer.\n\nHere we have the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nThings on this end are very high energy,\n\nand this rainbow right here is our visible light spectrum.\n\nUltraviolet and above, these types of radiation\n\ncan potentially damage our cells in our body,\n\nand can lead to changes in our cells and mutations.\n\nBut when you get below the energy level of visible light\n\nand you get into infrared and microwaves, way down here,\n\nthose are your radio waves.\n\nSo this radio frequency radiation\n\nis one of the lowest energy types of radiation,\n\nand it's considered what we call non-ionizing,\n\nmeaning it cannot penetrate your body.\n\nSo even if those radio waves are all over our planet,\n\nbecause we have cell reception everywhere,\n\nthe amount of energy that they're exerting\n\nis not actually going to damage your body\n\nor cause you any potential harm.\n\n@JohnPetersonFW wants to know, I'd really like to know,\n\nfrom someone that actually knows\n\nif buying organic food for double the price\n\nis actually worth it/better for you.\n\nThe biggest misconception is that organic is pesticide free.\n\nHere we have organic blueberries.\n\nThey are grown using organic pesticides\n\nand organic pesticides are simply chemicals\n\nthat have not been synthetically altered\n\nfrom the original state in which they exist\n\nsomewhere in nature.\n\nIn contrast, these are conventional blueberries\n\nwho were grown using conventional pesticides.\n\nConventional pesticides are those that can be\n\nsynthetically altered in order to improve their specificity.\n\nA 2010 study in PLoS One was looking at\n\nsix different pesticides that are used to control aphids\n\non soybean plants.\n\nIt was found to not only control aphids,\n\nbut it also killed the natural predators of the aphids,\n\nthe insidious flower bug, and the Asian lady beetle,\n\nhaving a more broad negative ecological impact.\n\nAnother misconception about all produce\n\nis that they have all these residues of pesticides on them.\n\nWe're talking about parts per trillion, parts per billion.\n\nThese are minuscule levels.\n\nIf you're very concerned about it, absolutely.\n\nWash your produce in water.\n\nBut aside from that,\n\nyou don't need to be stressing about your produce.\n\n@ToyaRochelle wants to know,\n\nwhat do people think they're cleansing\n\nwhen they do juice and smoothie cleanses or detoxes?\n\nBut I hate to break it to you,\n\nif you have functioning organ systems,\n\nyou're already detoxing all day every day.\n\nSo when people say that they're doing a parasite cleanse\n\nor a cleanse and they're claiming that these stringy things\n\nin their poop is parasite parse,\n\nwhat they're actually seeing is mucus\n\nand sloughed off intestinal cells,\n\nwhich is not a good thing,\n\nit's actually harming your GI tract.\n\n@bigpapabriggs wants to know, on a scale from one to 10,\n\nhow scared should I be of Lyme disease?\n\nSo as someone who's actually studied Lyme disease\n\nfor several decades,\n\nLyme disease is actually not as easy to get as you think.\n\nNot only do you have to have the right species of tick\n\nactually bite you, but it has to feed on you\n\nfor at least 24 hours\n\nin order to have a chance to transmit the bacteria for you.\n\nYour likelihood or risk of getting Lyme disease\n\nis very, very low.\n\nScale of one to 10, I would give it about a two or a three.\n\nThere's only two species of ticks in the US\n\nthat can transmit Lyme disease.\n\nThere are some areas in the country\n\nthat you have higher risk,\n\nlike the Midwest and the Northeast,\n\nand this is because you have higher proportions of\n\nboth the ticks that live there\n\nand the bacteria in those ticks.\n\nIn other parts of the country, the risk is almost zero.\n\nThere are a lot of common myths about Lyme disease.\n\nThe first is that once you're infected,\n\nyou're always gonna be infected, and that is just not true.\n\nIt's a bacterial infection,\n\nand once you've taken antibiotics for standard course\n\nor very effective treatments,\n\nyou're going to eliminate the bacteria.\n\nBut unfortunately, since it was discovered in the 1980s,\n\nit has really been the target of a lot of misinformation.\n\nAnd that can be attributed partially to some of these tests\n\nthat are sold direct to consumer,\n\nthat claim to be able to diagnose you with Lyme disease.\n\nUnfortunately, these tests are not FDA approved,\n\nand are not accurate, but they tell people\n\nthat they have Lyme disease when in reality they do not.\n\nSo it creates the perception that Lyme disease\n\nis not only more widespread than it is,\n\nbut is much more prevalent and severe.\n\n@RetiredDent, I'm seeing more and more parents\n\ngiving their children non fluoridated toothpaste.\n\nWhat's up with that?\n\nWhy are people so afraid of fluoride?\n\nWell, fluoride is a naturally occurring substance\n\nthat can be found in minerals and soil,\n\nand in our environment.\n\nAnd it was determined many, many years ago that communities\n\nthat had naturally higher levels of fluoride in their water\n\nwe're less likely to develop cavities.\n\nSo we started fluoridating water\n\nand adding fluoride to toothpaste over 75 years ago,\n\nand that's really plummeted\n\nthe amount of dental caries or cavities.\n\nUnfortunately claims on social media\n\nthat are not based on reality,\n\ntell people that fluoride is a neurotoxin.\n\nWhat they don't mention is that the dosage\n\nat which you'd have to consume fluoride\n\nin order to have any toxic effect\n\nis well outside of the reality\n\nof anything you could possibly consume.\n\nFluoride in water is added at 0.7 milligrams per kilogram,\n\nwhich means that in order to hit the minimum threshold\n\nwhere you might have skeletal effects from fluoride,\n\nif you were a child weighing 22 pounds,\n\nyou'd have to drink 57 liters of water a day.\n\nSo it really is not a concern.\n\n@karinefrigon says,\n\neverybody should have a gluten-free diet, I'm just saying.\n\nThe reality is if you don't have a medical reason\n\nto avoid gluten, you don't need to avoid gluten.\n\nGluten is a structural protein\n\nthat's found in certain grains like wheat,\n\nbarley, rosin and others.\n\nAnd there are certain medical conditions\n\nthat you should avoid this particular protein.\n\nThis would be something like celiac disease,\n\nwhich is an autoimmune disorder.\n\nThere's been a lot of studies\n\nin whether or not avoiding gluten offers a benefit,\n\nand the big consensus is is that it doesn't.\n\nSometimes we hear claims that the gluten here is worse\n\nbecause we use all the processed chemicals\n\nand we use all the pesticides.\n\nAnd when you went to Europe,\n\nyou were able to eat all the bread you wanted\n\nand you didn't have those issues with the gluten.\n\nAnd unfortunately, the gluten quantity in wheats\n\nacross countries is essentially the same.\n\nOn top of that, we also use the same pesticides.\n\nGlyphosate is one that's often demonized\n\nbecause it's used to dry down wheat,\n\nbut it's also used in Europe.\n\nEurope imports millions of pounds of American wheat\n\nevery year to make the very breads that you're eating.\n\nI would suggest that maybe you're more relaxed\n\nwhile you're on vacation,\n\nand you're not gulping down your food\n\nin between bringing kids to activities and swallowing air,\n\nleading to the perceived feeling of bloat,\n\nwhich has nothing to do with the gluten,\n\nbut everything to do with the rushing\n\nand the stress that you have with your day-to-day life.\n\n@TealePB wants to know what makes a study,\n\nany study, reliable?\n\nSo when we talk about the scientific method,\n\nwe have what we call the hierarchy of evidence.\n\nAt the bottom, you have things that are generally based\n\non small sample sizes or opinions.\n\nFrom there, you're going into animal trials\n\nand in vitro data.\n\nSo these are your Petri dish studies, or your animal data\n\nthat are not automatically representative\n\nof what's happening in people.\n\nSay you wanna study a disease process in humans\n\nand you use an animal model\n\nthat that disease doesn't occur in,\n\nthat's not going to be an accurate\n\nor representative research model,\n\nbecause it's not going to give you data\n\nthat you can then generalize to people.\n\nOnce you get above that, you're moving into human studies.\n\nRandomized controlled trials, they're usually also blinded.\n\nThose are considered our gold standard,\n\nso with vaccine studies, this is very common.\n\nThere is a group of people that receive the placebo,\n\nwhich is usually salt water,\n\nand there are people that received the vaccine.\n\nNone of them know what they received,\n\nyou might report different symptoms than if you knew\n\nyou were getting the placebo.\n\nAt the very top, you have what we call meta-analyses\n\nand systematic reviews.\n\nThese are analyses where we take multiple studies\n\nand we pool them and analyze them together.\n\nThere are really high quality journals like JAMA,\n\nwhich is the Journal of the American Medical Association\n\nor PNAS, which is the Proceedings\n\nof the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nBut as a rule of thumb, if you're trying to find information\n\non a given topic, you wanna look for at the minimum,\n\nthat it is indeed peer reviewed,\n\nand that it is aligning with other topics\n\nor other papers that are in that field.\n\nIt is very, very unlikely that one study\n\nis going to displace the thousands of other studies\n\nwithin a given field or topic.\n\nWe call that cherry picking.\n\n@WishWellTherapy wants know,\n\nstudy after study has revealed that aspartame,\n\nsucralose, and saccharin lead to cancer\n\nand other disorders of the cells and organ.\n\nSaccharin was actually banned temporarily in the US,\n\nbecause there was thought to be a relationship\n\nbetween saccharin and bladder cancer.\n\nIt turns out that the studies they were using\n\nwere using a type of rat.\n\nThese rats had a genetic predisposition\n\nthat they developed these bladder crystals,\n\nand made them more likely to develop tumors.\n\nNot only were we using rats that were not an appropriate\n\nor realistic research model, these rats were being fed\n\nclose to 10% of their body weight per day in saccharin.\n\nAnd it was at that point that a proportion of the male rats\n\ndeveloped bladder cancers.\n\nFollow-up studies using rhesus macaques, mice,\n\nand looking at human data have demonstrated\n\nthat saccharin is not related to cancer in humans at all,\n\nand so the ban was lifted.\n\nBut ultimately that stigma related to saccharin\n\nhas actually transferred to other artificial sweeteners.\n\n@flyrodu asks, how do we know that supplements work?\n\nIs there any real research on all these supplements\n\nthat exist?\n\nE.G, athletic greens, et cetera?\n\nSo in the United States alone,\n\nthe dietary supplement industry\n\nis worth nearly $160 billion.\n\nUnlike FDA approved medications,\n\nsupplements do not have to prove that they are helping\n\nor offering a benefit.\n\nA lot of people may take powdered vitamin C\n\nand mix it into their water\n\nwhen they feel like they have a cold or a flu coming on.\n\nVitamin C supplementation doesn't reduce the duration\n\nof respiratory illnesses,\n\nit doesn't lessen the severity of them,\n\nit doesn't prevent them.\n\nThere's been a lot of studies, especially in recent years\n\nthat have been looking at\n\nthe benefits of vitamin D supplement.\n\nSo this one assessed the efficacy of vitamin D and zinc\n\nin combination to improve outcomes of Covid-19.\n\nAnd ultimately what these show is that\n\nvitamin D supplementation did not lessen disease severity,\n\ndid not reduce hospital stay,\n\ndid not reduce severity of symptoms,\n\nand did not improve mortality outcomes.\n\nAnd there was a study that actually found over 50%\n\nof immune boosting supplements\n\nwere lying about what was in the product.\n\nAnd worse, some were not\n\nmentioning things that were in them.\n\n@pennebykameron wants to know,\n\nis there scientific evidence of crystals\n\nbefore and after charging?\n\nMany people believe that crystals have energetic powers,\n\nthat the crystal, or the energy in the crystal\n\nis vibrating with your own personal energy.\n\nAnd unfortunately there have been no studies\n\nthat have suggested that this is a true relationship.\n\nIt is likely nothing more than the placebo effect.\n\nThe placebo effect can be very strong.\n\nThere is a body of data that suggests that in some instances\n\npeople can feel like they're recovering\n\nfrom things more quickly or that their symptoms\n\nor side effects are lower\n\nbecause they have that power of the placebo.\n\nSo we don't wanna discount the placebo effect,\n\nbut we certainly don't want it to replace\n\nactual science-based medicine.\n\n@Janani802 wants to know, can fasting help cancer patients?\n\nSo this claim is really pervasive,\n\nand as someone who works in cancer research\n\nis really harmful for a lot of reasons,\n\nand it kind of breaks my heart.\n\nThis claim originated from in vitro studies,\n\nor Petri dish studies where we are growing cancer cells.\n\nAnd what they found was depriving them of nutrients,\n\nor simulating fasting cause the cancer cells to die.\n\nBut what that fails to account for is that\n\nany cell deprived of nutrient is going to fail to grow.\n\nAnd what happening in a piece of plastic\n\nor a plastic dish like this,\n\nis not what is happening inside the complex being of a human\n\nwho has cancer.\n\nFasting can actually be harmful if you're battling cancer,\n\n'cause you're depriving yourself and your body\n\nof very essential nutrients and calories that you need\n\nfor your immune system to do its best work.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nAlways be skeptical when you encounter things\n\nthat may not be as they seem.\n\nThanks for

The team was founded in 2017 and one of its original members, Adrienne So, is still on staff as a senior editor. We also work with a small group of trusted freelance contributors who are experts in their field. You\u2019ll find an author bio that outlines each tester\u2019s expertise on any review we publish. Our mission is to provide the most authentic and engaging buying advice for every product our audience needs or wants, to pioneer product discovery for tech enthusiasts, and to serve as a trusted hub for fair and thoughtful product reviews.\n\nHow does WIRED select products to test and review?\n\nWe\u2019re looking to write about products our readers are interested in, which means everything from groundbreaking new tech to novel gadgets they\u2019ve seen all over social media, to products like bed-in-a-box mattresses where it\u2019s difficult for any individual consumer to do proper comparison shopping. Our audience is tech-savvy, so you\u2019ll see lots of coverage of mobile phones, laptops, gaming devices, and the like, but WIRED readers also like to live comfortably and healthfully, score great deals, and often enjoy outdoor recreation.\n\nWhy should I trust WIRED\u2019s product reviews?\n\nBecause we tell the truth and we do the work. WIRED\u2019s Reviews team tests every product and service we write about, even when we\u2019re picking the best Amazon Prime Day deals. Our product recommendations are made in service to readers and independently of revenue considerations. While we do get a small cut of most sales when readers click to buy recommended products discussed in our product reviews and buying guides, the content in those guides is created through a rigorous and independent editorial process and is subjected to the same high standards as everything else WIRED publishes. Content from our Reviews team is fact-checked by editors and goes through the same prepublication review process as any other WIRED story. When we make a mistake, we immediately correct it and append an editor\u2019s note for transparency as appropriate.\n\nDoes the WIRED Reviews team use generative AI?\n\nNo. We follow the same editorial standards as everything else published by WIRED. You can read our whole policy here, but the gist is that we do not publish stories with text generated by AI, except when AI-generated text is the point of the story.\n\nDo you purchase every product you test?\n\nNo, but we do not accept \u201cfree products\u201d from manufacturers or make any agreements that involve a promise of editorial coverage in exchange for sending us a product. We often accept delivery of review samples directly from PR agencies and brands, which we typically don't pay for. We return or donate these samples after testing. When we know a specific product is of interest to readers and a review sample is not available, WIRED will purchase the product and the writer will donate it after testing.\n\nHow does the WIRED Reviews team conduct testing for product reviews?\n\nHow we test each product depends on what it is. We thoroughly test anything we recommend to readers and try to explain our methodology in each article without bogging it down with excessive detail many readers don\u2019t care about. Our overall goal in all testing is to replicate the product\u2019s regular use as closely as we can\u2014this is why we review mattresses by sleeping on them in our homes rather than dropping a bowling ball on them in a lab where we conduct \u201cnap tests.\u201d Since our testing methodology is a popular question with both readers and brands, we\u2019ve compiled the basic protocols for some of our key coverage areas below.\n\nEbikes: WIRED reviews upward of 50 new ebikes a year by riding them on a variety of terrain for at least 40 miles over the course of at least two weeks. We test cargo bikes by hauling kids and groceries, we ride mountain and gravel bikes on trails, and we test commuter bikes while running errands on regular city streets (including up and down steep hills). In addition to our real-life testing, we evaluate specs like weight, tire size, battery life, motor power, and the sourcing of key components to make our guides to the Best Ebikes and Best Cheap Ebikes.\n\nElectric scooters: WIRED reviewers ride electric scooters for at least 30 miles, though often much longer, on varying terrain and under various power loads (such as laden with groceries or up and down steep hills). Our main tester, the author of our guide to the Best Electric Scooters, is Brooklyn-based Julian Chokkattu, who takes electric scooters on the same routes through Bushwick during his tests so he can evaluate how a scooter may deviate from the established baseline.\n\nFitness trackers: WIRED\u2019s lead tester wears fitness trackers for at least two weeks and evaluates them on fit, specifications, durability, battery life, whether she can see the display in natural daylight, and whether features perform as advertised\u2014for example, AI coaching, climbing software, or GPS tracking. She also evaluates companion smartphone apps based on ease of use and claimed features.\n\nMattresses: We sleep on any mattress we recommend for at least a week in our own homes, though we sometimes give up on a mattress after a few nights (we then tell readers to avoid it), and we will sometimes spend months long-term testing. Lead reviewer Martin Cizmar has established a level of real-life mattress testing that\u2019s unmatched among our competitors, who frequently do a \"nap test\" where they form an opinion after sitting around on a mattress in their office.\n\nOffice chairs: We sit on every chair we test for several weeks while working\u2014two weeks at the minimum, but often much longer than that. We also invite different friends and family members to try the chairs out so we can assess comfort levels for folks with different heights and body types.\n\nMobile phones: To compile our expansive library of smartphone reviews and guides, our testers use any smartphone they\u2019re reviewing for at least a week, but sometimes longer. We test each phone by loading in our own SIM cards and using the phone as we would any personal device for the duration of the testing period. To compare cameras, we take the same photos on a second, similarly priced phone at the same time and study the results. For phone cases, which we test for at least a few days each, we look for alignment between ports and holes, check all buttons for clickiness, judge how it feels in our pockets, and check for how much the case is raised over the screen and camera lenses. We don't do drop tests as we don\u2019t have enough free phones to replace all the broken ones.\n\nInternet routers: WIRED tests Wi-Fi and mesh routers for at least one week, though often longer, in a home setting. We test the stated features and introduce stress testing, such as cutting the power to see how routers cope with a sudden loss of power. Our lead tester, Simon Hill, also runs a bevy of technical tests, including network throughput testing, file transfers, coverage heatmaps, and speed tests\u2014all organized into a handy (and impressive) spreadsheet.\n\nAir Purifiers: WIRED reviews more than 50 new air purifiers a year, assessing them in various home environments from coast to coast for months at a time. We test air purifiers in both homes and 100-year-old apartments with cats, dogs, and gas stoves, and near highways and in urban areas. In addition to our real-world testing, we measure decibel levels, ease of use, and efficacy, and we evaluate cost, design, length of warranty, and most importantly, the rate of air exchange in a specific-size room, making our deep dives, reviews, and Best Air Purifier guide essential reading.\n\nSoundbars: WIRED\u2019s staffers, including Parker Hall and Ryan Waniata, evaluate soundbars using a wide variety of testing material, from custom-made Dolby Atmos demos to familiar movies like Guardians of the Galaxy, sitcoms like Seinfeld and Parks and Recreation, and everything in between. We test apps and features like auto-calibration, surround sound speakers, and multiroom audio integration in multiple settings wherever possible. For music testing, we stream carefully curated playlists and random radio stations at compressed and lossless resolutions over Bluetooth and Wi-Fi where available. We live with these products over multiple days at minimum to test their usability the same way we expect you to use them.\n\nHeadphones and earbuds: Headphones and earbuds come in a multitude of styles, sizes, and varieties and we test them in accordance. For all headphones we test, sound quality, comfort, and fit are of the utmost importance. For wireless headphones and earbuds, we pay special attention to key aspects like ease of pairing and setup, battery life, app connection and settings, and convenience features like speak-to-chat. When focusing on sound quality, we use curated playlists with familiar music (from Fleetwood Mac\u2019s \u201cThe Chain\u201d to The Weeknd\u2019s \u201cStarboy\u201d) in both compressed and lossless resolution where applicable. For spatial audio, we test music and videos in multiple formats, including Dolby Atmos.\n\nTelevisions: TVs are among the most important products in A/V, and we test them accordingly. We spend at least a week with each TV we test, using it day and night as our daily driver. We utilize carefully selected video and audio content (from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows on Blu-ray to Our Planet in Dolby Vision and Atmos on Netflix). Our testing material runs the gamut, including live broadcasts, streaming content, and physical media with high-end Ultra HD Blu-ray players. We use Spears & Munsil\u2019s latest Ultra HD Benchmark discs to lock in settings and evaluate multiple resolution and HDR formats, including Dolby Vision, HDR10, and HDR10+. We watch content in various light conditions and test usability features, from smart assistants to services like AirPlay 2 and Chromecast to paint a holistic picture.\n\nRunning gear: Our lead writer runs four to five times a week, around 20 to 25 miles per week, and evaluates the gear\u2019s overall performance with a mix of long runs, interval runs, and trail and road running.\n\nPizza ovens: To name the best pizza ovens, we test each oven in our backyard for a minimum of two weeks. While using the oven, our testers also use handheld infrared thermometers to take the temperature of the baking stone at various places to gauge how evenly they heat and cook. We test all ovens with homemade dough, store-bought dough, and frozen pizzas.\n\nLuggage and backpacks: WIRED tests luggage designed primarily for air travel by taking it on at least two flights. When reviewing backpacks, our testers wear them for at least two weeks. In addition to this regular use, we also evaluate design details, like whether they have straight or curved zippers, what gauge the zippers are, whether they're toothed or coiled, what the warranty is, whether the hardware is metal or plastic, or whether the fabric is sustainable. Our reviewers also do things like fill backpacks full of books and toss them around, and kick carry-on bags to see whether they get foot marks or are easy to clean.\n\nUmbrellas: Our testers use umbrellas several times, whenever it rains. We test them as a normal person would while checking for the main hallmarks of what makes a good umbrella, as listed in our buying guide. We also aim to get a good sense of how each umbrella handles gusts and heavy storms.\n\nWebcams: We use every webcam we test for several weeks as a daily driver, and our testers also try to compare the image quality with another similar model. Reviewers make audio recordings to see how the mics pick up their voices. Webcam testers often solicit feedback on appearance and sound quality during our weekly Gear team meetings, which take place over Zoom.\n\nBidets: For our guide to the Best Bidets, our testers install the bidets on a toilet in their homes and use each sample for at least a week.\n\nMonitors: Reviewer Nena Farrell leads our coverage of the best computer monitors and tests each pick for at least one week, with a minimum of three working days. She sets monitors up with both a PC and Mac laptop to check performance, and she runs at least two different video games to see how the monitor performs, even if it isn't a monitor designed specifically for video games.\n\nCamp cookware: Reviewer Scott Gilbertson famously lives in an RV, so he is always testing camp cookware. In fact, grills and other cookware are tested for months before they ever make it into a guide. He cooks outside every day, rotating stoves every few months so he gets a good sense of how they perform, how they stand up to weather, and how hard they are to clean.\n\nTents: We aim to spend at least a week in every tent, ideally in a variety of weather conditions. Every pocket, zipper, guy line, and feature is tested. Will the rainfly catch on the door zippers? Is the ventilation good? Is the tent easy to set up? We assess all of the above and more, and list our favorites in our Best Tents buying guide.\n\nMeal kits: When testing meal kit delivery services, each service is evaluated meal-by-meal over the course of a few days. Our lead reviewer follows recipes to the letter and substitutes ingredients only if something arrives inedible\u2014for example, if something thaws during shipment or the produce is moldy (these substitutions are always noted). She always has at least one other person try a meal and notes down both of their first impressions and opinions before discussing the meal further. She assesses packaging, ingredient quality, texture, and taste, then factors in price to make recommendations.\n\nSecurity cameras: Indoor and outdoor security cameras are tested for at least one month. We test any manufacturer claims and special features, like motion detection or smartphone alerts, and stress-test the cameras as well. We also test videofeed quality and loading times.\n\nVideo doorbells: We test video doorbells for a minimum of two weeks. Any manufacturer claims are tested and verified, as are smartphone companion apps or smart home connectivity options. We also consider the data storage, retention, and privacy policies of the manufacturers of each camera we test, as these things also factor into our recommendations.\n\nSex toys and tech: We test sex tech for a minimum of two weeks using common sense. We test on different erogenous zones and different bodies. We also conduct controlled tests for features like battery life, waterproofness, and ease of cleaning. We test manufacturer claims as well.\n\nEspresso machines and coffee gear: We use espresso machines and coffee gear for at least two weeks in everyday situations. We also perform some controlled tests. Our lead reviewer tests for consistency, how hot the heating elements get, how quickly they heat up, how much time needs to pass between switching functions (brewing versus steaming), and the like. She also tests general usability. Is the machine easy to clean and maintain? Are things that need to be cleaned easily accessible? Does it look nice on the counter or does it seem to acquire a grime after only a couple uses? Does the steaming wand work efficiently? All of these factors inform our assessment.\n\nCoffee grinders: Our lead reviewer assesses coffee grinders for at least two weeks using a mix of everyday use and controlled tests. She\u2019s mostly testing for consistency, as well as factors like how quickly grime builds up in the burrs, how accessible the burrs are for cleaning, how loud the grinder is, and how finely or coarsely it can grind. She also assesses for ease of cleaning and overall maintenance requirements.\n\nDigital cameras: We test cameras by using them over a period of (ideally) months, but often just weeks because DSLR cameras, compact system cameras, and mirrorless cameras are generally loaned to us on a short-term basis, and camera companies are eager to pass them on to the next reviewer. Our lead reviewer tries to shoot at least 500 images on every camera he tests. He then views and edits the resulting RAW and JPG files in Darktable.\n\nCoolers: We test coolers by putting a standard bag of cube ice inside it on a warm day (at least 75 degrees Fahrenheit), putting the cooler in the shade, and then timing how long it takes for the ice to melt. We also assess weight, portability, durability, and overall design.\n\nBinoculars: We test binoculars by going birding. And to baseball games. And stargazing. For months and months.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast', 'Martin Cizmar', 'Mark Harris', 'Eric Ravenscraft', 'Adrienne So']", "top_image": "https://www.wired.com/verso/static/wired/assets/favicon.ico", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.wired.com/about/faq/", "timestamp": "1719366068.4402828", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "WIRED\u2019s \u2018On Background\u2019 Policy", "text": "Many powerful companies make a practice of obfuscating or dodging accountability when speaking to media outlets by providing information while insisting it not be attributed to anyone in particular, and sometimes not even to the company itself. For that reason, WIRED is joining the Verge, Quartz, and others in making its editorial standards clearer.\n\nAnyone talking to WIRED reporters in any official capacity does so on the record by default. This means that what you say or write can be quoted and attributed to you by name, not just as \u201ca company spokesperson.\u201d We typically allow anonymity only to sources who could face retaliation or be endangered by the information they provide, and when we do so we explain our reasons to readers. As Julia Angwin, editor in chief of the Markup, has noted, \u201cCorporate spokespeople who are paid to provide information simply don\u2019t meet the criteria for being granted anonymity.\u201d\n\nSometimes we may agree to have a conversation on background, meaning we can use the information you provide, but will not identify you by name. Conversations are on background only when we agree to it. If you send us a statement \u201con background\u201d without prior agreement, we may still treat it as on the record.\n\nYou must also get our agreement for each proposed condition of the conversation, such as requests to not quote a particular statement directly or to identify a source in a certain way. Please be clear about your exact requests every time you speak with WIRED. At our discretion we may also tell our readers why we\u2019re providing the information in this way.\n\nOff-the-record conversations cannot be used for publication, and they also must be agreed to (which we rarely do for corporate spokespeople).\n\nThe companies you speak for play significant roles in shaping the future; we have a responsibility to tell our readers how we got the information about your plans to shape it.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast', 'Martin Cizmar', 'Mark Harris', 'Eric Ravenscraft', 'Adrienne So']", "top_image": "https://www.wired.com/verso/static/wired/assets/favicon.ico", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.wired.com/about/wired-on-background-policy/", "timestamp": "1719366069.5793211", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "15 Best Mattresses You Can Buy Online (2024)", "text": "You'll spend a third of your life on a mattress, which means picking the right one is important. Start with your preferred sleeping position and how much support you need. Here are a few tips.\n\nShould you buy a firm or soft mattress? Generally, heavier people and back or stomach sleepers will do better with firmer mattresses, while lighter people and side sleepers enjoy softer mattresses. Temperature is also an issue: Softer mattresses sleep warmer since your body is sinking into a layer of fabric and foam. Keep in mind that all mattresses have a break-in period, and the way the mattress feels on your first night won't be how it feels after a week or two.\n\nDo you want a hybrid or foam mattress? The next big question is whether you want a foam mattress or a hybrid model that layers foam with built-in springs. We tend to recommend hybrids because they are more stable and supportive, and they usually stay cooler. Hybrids are often slightly pricier. Foam mattresses tend to be softer, lighter, and cheaper.\n\nWhat size mattress do you need? The prices below are based on the queen size, but almost all mattresses come in the standard sizes of Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, and California King. You'll want to buy a mattress based on the size of your bed frame.\n\nHow easy is it to set up a bed-in-a-box? Most of these mattresses are delivered in a box, vacuum-sealed, and rolled up. Some are pretty heavy\u2014up to 150 pounds\u2014so be sure you have someone to help you. After you unroll your bed-in-a-box mattress and cut the vacuum bag open, it'll immediately begin to inflate, so unbox it on your bed frame or near it. We have a helpful guide on how to set up the mattress you bought online with more tips. The mattresses are usually ready to go in a few hours, but most manufacturers recommend giving them two days to reach their normal state.\n\nShould you wait for a sale to buy a mattress? Mattresses go on sale often. If you see one at full price, there's a strong chance you can save hundreds of dollars by waiting for the next big sale event (every few months).\n\nWhat if you don't like the mattress you bought online? Most of the mattresses we have tested and recommend have at least a 100-night testing period and a 10-year warranty. You may want to look at the company's policy as you may be on the hook for a nominal return fee.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast', 'Martin Cizmar', 'Medea Giordano', 'Eric Ravenscraft', 'Scott Gilbertson', 'Louryn Strampe', 'Julian Chokkattu', 'Adrienne So', 'Nena Farrell']", "top_image": "https://media.wired.com/photos/664e22250b09b2ef41a851ac/191:100/w_2580,c_limit/Best-mattress-update-collage-052024-SOURCE-Martin-Cizmar.jpg", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-mattresses/", "timestamp": "1719366073.918457", "displayed": 0}
{"title": "The 16 Best Electric Bikes for Every Kind of Ride", "text": "For years, electric bicycles were bulky, inconvenient, expensive machines with limited battery life. Slowly, that has changed. Ebikes are now lighter, more attractive, and more powerful than ever. You don't need to be physically fit to ride one. They get you outside, reduce traffic congestion, and shrink your carbon footprint. I ride one daily to take my kids to school. They're just fun.\n\nOver the past few years, WIRED's Reviews team has tried almost every kind of electric bike, from the best heavy-duty cargo bikes to high-end mountain bikes. We review upward of 50 new ebikes a year by riding them on a variety of terrain for at least 40 miles over the course of at least two weeks. We test cargo bikes by hauling kids and groceries, we ride mountain and gravel bikes on trails, and we test commuter bikes while running errands on regular city streets (including up and down steep hills). In addition to our real-life testing, we evaluate specs like weight, tire size, battery life, motor power, and the sourcing of key components. If you don't see what you want, check back later (or drop me a note!). Once you buy an ebike, check out our Best Bike Accessories, Best Bike Locks, and the Best Ebikes for Elderly Riders. Not into pedaling? Read our Best Escooters guide for other transport options.\n\nUpdated June 2024: We added the Rad Power Radster Road, the Linus eDutchi, the Gazelle Eclipse, and the Aventon Ramblas. We also updated links and prices.\n\nSpecial offer for Gear readers: Get WIRED for just $5 ($25 off). This includes unlimited access to WIRED.com, full Gear coverage, and subscriber-only newsletters.

{"title": "Microsoft\u2019s Mustafa Suleyman says he loves Sam Altman, believes he\u2019s sincere about AI safety", "text": "In an interview at the Aspen Ideas Festival on Tuesday, Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, made it very clear that he admires OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\nCNBC\u2019s Andrew Ross Sorkin asked what the plan will be when Microsoft\u2019s enormous AI future isn\u2019t so closely dependent on OpenAI, using a metaphor of winning a bicycling race. But Suleyman sidestepped.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t buy the metaphor that there is a finish line. This is another false frame,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to stop framing everything as a ferocious race.\u201d\n\nHe then proceeded to toe the Microsoft corporate line about his company\u2019s arrangement with OpenAI, in which it invested a reported $10 billion through some combination of cash and cloud credits. The deal gives Microsoft a big stake in OpenAI\u2019s for-profit business, and allows it to embed its AI models into Microsoft wares and sell its tech to Microsoft cloud customers. Some reports indicate that Microsoft may also be entitled to some OpenAI payments.\n\n\u201cIt is true that we have ferocious competition with them,\u201d Suleyman said about OpenAI. \u201cThey are an independent company. We don\u2019t own or control them. We don\u2019t even have any board members. So they do entirely their own thing. But we have a deep partnership. I\u2019m very good friends with Sam, have huge respect and, trust and faith in what they\u2019ve done. And that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to roll for many, many years to come,\u201d Suleyman said.\n\nThis close/distant relationship is important for Suleyman to profess. Microsoft\u2019s investors and enterprise customers appreciate the close relationship. But regulators did get curious and in April, the EU agreed that its investment was not a true takeover. Should that change, in all likelihood so would the regulatory involvement.\n\nSuleyman says he trusts Altman on AI safety\n\nIn a sense, Suleyman was the Sam Altman of AI before OpenAI. He has spent most of his career in competition with OpenAI, and is known for his own ego.\n\nSuleyman was the founder of AI pioneer DeepMind and sold it to Google in 2014. He was reportedly put on administrative leave following allegations of bullying employees, as Bloomberg reported in 2019, then moved to other Google roles before leaving the company in 2022 to join Greylock Partners as a venture partner. A few months later, he and Greylock\u2019s Reid Hoffman, a Microsoft board member, launched Inflection AI to build its own LLM chatbot, among other goals.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella tried but failed to hire Sam Altman last fall, when OpenAI fired him and then quickly reinstated him. After that, Microsoft hired Suleyman and much of Inflection in March, leaving a shell of a company and a big check. In his new role at Microsoft, Suleyman has been auditing OpenAI code, Semafor reported earlier this month. As one of OpenAI\u2019s previous big rivals, he\u2019s now getting to dive deep inside the crown-jewel frenemy competitor.\n\nThere\u2019s yet another wrinkle to all of this. OpenAI was founded with a premise of doing AI safety research, to stop a one-day evil AI from destroying humankind. In 2023, when he was still an OpenAI competitor, Suleyman released a book called \u201cThe Coming Wave: Technology, Power and the 21st Century\u2019s Greatest Dilemma\u201d with researcher Michael Bhaskar. The book discusses the dangers of AI and how to prevent them.\n\nA group of former OpenAI employees signed a letter earlier this month outlining their fears that OpenAI and other AI companies are not taking safety seriously enough.\n\nWhen asked about that, Suleyman also proclaimed his love and trust for Altman, but also that he wants to see both regulation and a slower pace.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m a Brit with European tendencies, but I don\u2019t fear regulation in the way that sort of everyone seems to by default,\u201d he said, describing all of this fingerpointing by the former employees as a \u201chealthy dialogue.\u201d He added, \u201cI think it\u2019s a great thing that technologists and entrepreneurs and CEOs of companies like myself and Sam, who I love dearly and think is awesome\u201d are talking about regulation. \u201cHe is not cynical, he is sincere. He believes it genuinely.\u201d\n\nBut he also said, \u201cFriction is going to be our friend here. These technologies are becoming so powerful, they will be so intimate, they\u2019ll be so ever-present, that this is a moment where it\u2019s fine to take stock.\u201d If all of this dialog slows down AI development by six to 18 months or longer \u201cit\u2019s time well spent.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all very cozy between these players.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman Image Credits: TechCrunch\n\nSuleyman wants cooperation with China, AI in classrooms\n\nSuleyman also made some interesting comments on other issues. On the AI race with China:\n\n\u201cWith all due respect to my good friends in DC and the military industrial complex, if it\u2019s the default frame that it can only be a new Cold War, then that is exactly what it will be because it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. They will fear that we fear that we\u2019re going to be adversarial so they have to be adversarial and this is only going to escalate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to find ways to cooperate, be respectful of them, whilst also acknowledging that we have a different set of values.\u201d\n\nThen again, he also said that China is \u201cbuilding their own technology ecosystem, and they\u2019re spreading that around the world. We should really pay close attention.\u201d\n\nWhen asked his opinion on kids using AI for schoolwork, Suleyman, who said he doesn\u2019t have kids, shrugged it off. \u201cI think we have to be slightly careful about fearing the downside of every tool, you know, just as when calculators came in, there was a kind of this gut reaction, oh, no, everyone\u2019s gonna be able to sort of solve all the equations instantly. And it\u2019s gonna make us dumber because we weren\u2019t able to do mental arithmetic.\u201d\n\nHe also envisions a time, very soon, where AI is like a teacher\u2019s aide, perhaps chatting live in the classroom, as AI\u2019s verbal skills improve. \u201cWhat would it look like for a great teacher or educator to have a profound conversation with an AI that is live and in front of their audience?\u201d\n\nThe upshot takeaway is that, if we want the people who are building and profiting from AI to govern and protect humanity from its worst effects, we may be setting unrealistic expectations.", "authors": "['Julie Bort']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Microsoft-AI-CEO-Mustafa-Suleyman.png?resize=1200,624", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/microsofts-mustafa-suleyman-says-he-loves-sam-altman-believes-hes-sincere-about-ai-safety/", "timestamp": "1719366109.204651", "displayed": 0}

(Its multimodal capabilities and ability to understand media give the AI model its name; the \u201co\u201d stands for \u201comni.\u201d)\n\nChatGPT\u2019s desktop app was announced in the same press release, as a new app for both free and paid users. The company noted at the time that it could be called up with the simple keyboard shortcut and users could also take and discuss screenshots directly in the app. Users can upload files and other photos via the macOS app, too, as well as speak to ChatGPT from their desktop and search through their past conversations.\n\nThe app had been slowly rolling out to Mac users, starting with Plus subscribers, but today the company announced in a post on X that it\u2019s now available to everyone.\n\nThis isn\u2019t OpenAI\u2019s only integration with Apple devices. At WWDC, the companies announced a more expansive deal that will also see Apple customers gaining access to ChatGPT from their iPhones and iPads, including through Siri and within other areas that could be aided by AI, like Writing Tools. These integrations are also powered by GPT-4o and will roll out to Apple customers later this year with the launch of Apple\u2019s newest operating systems.", "authors": "['Sarah Perez']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/chatgpt-mac.jpg?resize=1200,672", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/chatgpt-for-mac-is-now-available-to-all/", "timestamp": "1719366129.2917042", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "The RIAA\u2019s lawsuit against generative music startups will be the bloodbath AI needs", "text": "Like many AI companies, music generation startups Udio and Suno appear to have relied on unauthorized scrapes of copyrighted works in order to train their models. This is by their own and investors\u2019 admission, as well as according to new lawsuits filed against them by music companies. If these suits go before a jury, the trial could be both a damaging expos\u00e9 and a highly useful precedent for similarly sticky-fingered AI companies facing certain legal peril.\n\nThe lawsuits, filed by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), put us all in the uncomfortable position of rooting for the RIAA, which for decades has been the bogeyman of digital media. I myself have received nastygrams from them! The case is simply that clear.\n\nThe gist of the two lawsuits, which are extremely similar in content, is that Suno and Udio (strictly speaking, Uncharted Labs doing business as Udio) indiscriminately pillaged more or less the entire history of recorded music to form datasets, which they then used to train a music-generating AI.\n\nAnd here let us quickly note that these AIs don\u2019t \u201cgenerate\u201d so much as match the user\u2019s prompt to patterns from their training data and then attempt to complete that pattern. In a way, all these models do is perform covers or mashups of the songs they ingested.\n\nThat Suno and Udio did ingest said copyrighted data seems, for all intents and purposes (including legal ones), very likely. The companies\u2019 leadership and investors have been unwisely loose-lipped about the copyright challenges of the space.\n\nThey have admitted that the only way to create a good music generation model is to ingest a large amount of high-quality music. It is very simply a necessary step for creating machine learning models of this type.\n\nThen they said that they did so without the permission of music labels. Investor Antonio Rodriguez of Matrix Partners told Rolling Stone just a few months ago:\n\nHonestly, if we had deals with labels when this company got started, I probably wouldn\u2019t have invested in it. I think that they needed to make this product without the constraints.\n\nThe companies told the RIAA\u2019s lawyers that they believe the media it has ingested falls under fair-use doctrine \u2014 which fundamentally only comes into play in the unauthorized use of a work. Now, fair use is admittedly a complex and hazy concept in idea and execution, but the companies\u2019 use does appear to stray somewhat outside the intended safe harbor of, say, a seventh grader using a Pearl Jam song in the background of their video on global warming.\n\nTo be blunt, it looks like these companies\u2019 goose is cooked. They might have hoped that they could take a page from OpenAI\u2019s playbook, using evasive language and misdirection to stall their less deep-pocketed critics, like authors and journalists. (If by the time AI companies\u2019 skulduggery is revealed and they\u2019re the only option for distribution, it no longer matters.)\n\nBut it\u2019s harder to pull off when there\u2019s a smoking gun in your hand. And unfortunately for Udio and Suno, the RIAA says in its lawsuit that it has a few thousand smoking guns and that songs it owns are clearly being regurgitated by the music models. Its claim: that whether Jackson 5 or Maroon 5, the \u201cgenerated\u201d songs are lightly garbled versions of the originals \u2014 something that would be impossible if the original were not included in the training data.\n\nThe nature of LLMs \u2014 specifically, their tendency to hallucinate and lose the plot the more they write \u2014 precludes regurgitation of, for example, entire books. This has likely mooted a lawsuit by authors against OpenAI, since the latter can plausibly claim the snippets its model does quote were grabbed from reviews, first pages available online and so on. (The latest goalpost move is that they did use copyright works early on but have since stopped, which is funny because it\u2019s like saying you only juiced the orange once but have since stopped.)\n\nWhat you can\u2019t do is plausibly claim that your music generator only heard a few bars of \u201cGreat Balls of Fire\u201d and somehow managed to spit out the rest word for word and chord for chord. Any judge or jury would laugh in your face, and with luck a court artist will have their chance at illustrating that.\n\nThis is not only intuitively obvious but legally consequential as well, as the re-creation of entire works (garbled, but quite obviously based on the originals) opens up a new avenue for relief. If the RIAA can convince the judge that Udio and Suno are doing real and major harm to the business of the copyright holders and artists, it can ask the court to shut down the AI companies\u2019 whole operation at the outset of the trial with an injunction.\n\nOpening paragraphs of your book coming out of an LLM? That\u2019s an intellectual issue to be discussed at length. Dollar-store \u201cCall Me Maybe\u201d generated on demand? Shut it down. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right, but it\u2019s likely.\n\nThe predictable response from the companies has been that the system is not intended to replicate copyrighted works: a desperate, naked attempt to offload liability onto users under Section 230 safe harbor. That is, the same way Instagram isn\u2019t liable if you use a copyrighted song to back your Reel. Here, the argument seems unlikely to gain traction, partly because of the aforementioned admissions that the company itself ignored copyright to begin with.\n\nWhat will be the consequence of these lawsuits? As with all things AI, it\u2019s quite impossible to say ahead of time, since there is little in the way of precedent or applicable, settled doctrine.\n\nMy prediction is that the companies will be forced to expose their training data and methods, these things being of clear evidentiary interest. And if this evidence shows that they are indeed misusing copyrighted material, we\u2019ll see an attempt to settle or avoid trial, and/or a speedy judgment against Udio and Suno. It\u2019s likely that at least one of the two will attempt to continue onward, using legal (or at least legal-adjacent) sources of music, but the resulting model would (by their own standards for training data) almost certainly result in a huge step down in quality, and users would flee.\n\nInvestors? Ideally, they\u2019ll lose their shirts, having placed their bets on something that was in all likelihood illegal and certainly unethical, and not just in the eyes of nebbish author associations but according to the legal minds at the infamously and ruthlessly litigious RIAA.\n\nThe consequences may be far-reaching: If investors in a hot new generative media startup suddenly see a hundred million dollars vaporized due to the fundamental nature of generative media, suddenly a different level of diligence will seem appropriate.\n\nCompanies may learn from the trial or settlement documents what can be said \u2014 or perhaps more importantly, what should not be said \u2014 to avoid liability and keep copyright holders guessing.\n\nThough this particular suit seems almost a foregone conclusion, it will not be a playbook to prosecuting or squeezing settlements out of other generative AI companies but an object lesson in hubris.\n\nIt\u2019s good to have one of those every once in a while, even if the teacher happens to be the RIAA.", "authors": "['Devin Coldewey']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-1495170962.jpg?resize=1200,800", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/the-riaas-lawsuit-against-generative-music-startups-will-be-the-bloodbath-ai-needs/", "timestamp": "1719366141.555956", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "Etched is building an AI chip that only runs one type of model", "text": "As generative AI touches a growing number of industries, the companies producing chips to run the models are benefiting enormously. Nvidia, in particular, wields massive influence, commanding an estimated 70% to 95% of the market for AI chips. Cloud providers from Meta to Microsoft are spending billions of dollars on Nvidia GPUs, wary of falling behind in the generative AI race.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable, then, that generative AI vendors aren\u2019t pleased with the status quo. A large portion of their success hinges on the whims of the dominant chipmakers. And so they, along with opportunist VCs, are on the hunt for promising upstarts to challenge the AI chip incumbents.\n\nEtched is among the many, many alternative chip companies vying for a seat at the table \u2014 but it\u2019s also among the most intriguing. Only two years old, Etched was founded by a pair of Harvard dropouts, Gavin Uberti (ex-OctoML and ex-Xnor.ai) and Chris Zhu, who along with Robert Wachen and former Cypress Semiconductor CTO Mark Ross, sought to create a chip that could do one thing: run AI models.\n\nThat\u2019s not unusual. Plenty of startups and tech giants are developing chips that exclusively run AI models, also known as inferencing chips. Meta has MTIA, Amazon has Graviton and Inferentia, and so on. But Etched\u2019s chips are unique in that they only run a single type of model: Transformers.\n\nThe transformer, proposed by a team of Google researchers back in 2017, has become the dominant generative AI model architecture by far.\n\nTransformers underpin OpenAI\u2019s video-generating model Sora. They\u2019re at the heart of text-generating models like Anthropic\u2019s Claude and Google\u2019s Gemini. And they power art generators such as the newest version of Stable Diffusion.\n\n\u201cIn 2022, we made a bet that transformers would take over the world,\u201d Uberti, Etched\u2019s CEO, told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve hit a point in the evolution of AI where specialized chips that can perform better than general-purpose GPUs are inevitable \u2014 and the technical decision-makers of the world know this.\u201d\n\nEtched\u2019s chip, called Sohu, is an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) \u2014 a chip tailored for a particular application \u2014 made for running transformers. Manufactured using TSMC\u2019s 4nm process, Sohu can deliver dramatically better inferencing performance than GPUs and other general-purpose AI chips while drawing less energy, claims Uberti.\n\n\u201cSohu is an order of magnitude faster and cheaper than even Nvidia\u2019s next generation of Blackwell GB200 GPUs when running text, image and video transformers,\u201d Uberti said. \u201cOne Sohu server replaces 160 H100 GPUs. \u2026 Sohu will be a more affordable, efficient and environmentally friendly option for business leaders that need specialized chips.\u201d\n\nHow does Sohu achieve all this? In a few ways, but the most obvious (and intuitive) is a streamlined inferencing hardware-and-software pipeline. Because Sohu doesn\u2019t run non-transformer models, the Etched team could do away with hardware components not relevant to transformers and trim the software overhead traditionally used for deploying and running non-transformers.\n\nA graph from Etched comparing hardware performance running Meta\u2019s open model Llama 70B. Image Credits: Etched\n\nEtched is arriving on the scene at an inflection point in the race for generative AI infrastructure. Beyond cost concerns, the GPUs and other hardware components necessary to run models at scale today are dangerously power-hungry.\n\nGoldman Sachs predicts that AI is poised to drive a 160% increase in data center electricity demand by 2030, contributing to a significant uptick in greenhouse gas emissions. Researchers at UC Riverside, meanwhile, estimate that global AI usage could cause data centers to suck up 1.1 trillion to 1.7 trillion gallons of fresh water by 2027, impacting local resources. (Many data centers use water to cool servers.)\n\nUberti optimistically \u2014 or bombastically, depending on how you interpret it \u2014 pitches Sohu as the solution to the industry\u2019s consumption problem.\n\n\u201cIn short, our future customers won\u2019t be able to afford not to switch to Sohu,\u201d Uberti said. \u201cCompanies are willing to take a bet on Etched because speed and cost are existential to the AI products they are trying to build.\u201d\n\nBut can Etched, assuming it meets its goal of bringing Sohu to the mass market in the next few months, succeed when so many others are following close behind it?\n\nThe company lacks a direct competitor at present, but AI chip startup Perceive recently previewed a processor with hardware acceleration for transformers. Groq has also invested heavily in transformer-specific optimizations for its ASIC.\n\nCompetition aside, what if transformers one day fall out of favor? Uberti says, in that case, Etched will do the obvious: Design a new chip. Fair enough, but that\u2019s a pretty drastic fallback option, considering how long it\u2019s taken to bring Sohu to fruition.\n\nNone of these concerns have dissuaded investors from pouring an enormous amount of money into Etched, though.\n\nToday, Etched said it has closed a $120 million Series A funding round, co-led by Primary Venture Partners and Positive Sum Ventures. Bringing Etched\u2019s total raised to $125.36 million, the round saw participation from heavyweight angel backers including Peter Thiel (Uberti, Zhu and Wachen are Thiel Fellowship alums), GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke, Cruise (and the Bot Company) co-founder Kyle Vogt, and Quora co-founder Charlie Cheever.\n\nThese investors presumably believe Etched has a reasonable chance of successfully scaling up its business of selling servers. Perhaps it does \u2014 Uberti claims unnamed customers have reserved \u201ctens of millions of dollars\u201d in hardware so far. The forthcoming launch of the Sohu Developer Cloud, which will let customers preview Sohu via an online interactive playground, should drive additional sales, Uberti suggested.\n\nStill, it seems too early to tell whether this will be enough to propel Etched and its 35-person team into the future its co-founders are envisioning. The AI chip segment can be unforgiving in the best of times \u2014 see the high-profile near-failures of AI chip startups like Mythic and Graphcore, and the declining investment in AI chip ventures in 2023.\n\nUberti makes a strong sales pitch, though: \u201cVideo generation, audio-to-audio modalities, robotics, and other future AI use cases will only be possible with a faster chip like Sohu. The entire future of AI technology will be shaped by whether the infrastructure can scale.\u201d", "authors": "['Kyle Wiggers']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1425576452.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/etched-is-building-an-ai-chip-that-only-runs-transformer-models/", "timestamp": "1719366209.719746", "displayed": 0}

Nvidia, in particular, wields massive influence, commanding an estimated 70% to 95% of the market for AI chips. Cloud providers from Meta to Microsoft are spending billions of dollars on Nvidia GPUs, wary of falling behind in the generative AI race.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable, then, that generative AI vendors aren\u2019t pleased with the status quo. A large portion of their success hinges on the whims of the dominant chipmakers. And so they, along with opportunist VCs, are on the hunt for promising upstarts to challenge the AI chip incumbents.\n\nEtched is among the many, many alternative chip companies vying for a seat at the table \u2014 but it\u2019s also among the most intriguing. Only two years old, Etched was founded by a pair of Harvard dropouts, Gavin Uberti (ex-OctoML and ex-Xnor.ai) and Chris Zhu, who along with Robert Wachen and former Cypress Semiconductor CTO Mark Ross, sought to create a chip that could do one thing: run AI models.\n\nThat\u2019s not unusual. Plenty of startups and tech giants are developing chips that exclusively run AI models, also known as inferencing chips. Meta has MTIA, Amazon has Graviton and Inferentia, and so on. But Etched\u2019s chips are unique in that they only run a single type of model: Transformers.\n\nThe transformer, proposed by a team of Google researchers back in 2017, has become the dominant generative AI model architecture by far.\n\nTransformers underpin OpenAI\u2019s video-generating model Sora. They\u2019re at the heart of text-generating models like Anthropic\u2019s Claude and Google\u2019s Gemini. And they power art generators such as the newest version of Stable Diffusion.\n\n\u201cIn 2022, we made a bet that transformers would take over the world,\u201d Uberti, Etched\u2019s CEO, told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve hit a point in the evolution of AI where specialized chips that can perform better than general-purpose GPUs are inevitable \u2014 and the technical decision-makers of the world know this.\u201d\n\nEtched\u2019s chip, called Sohu, is an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) \u2014 a chip tailored for a particular application \u2014 made for running transformers. Manufactured using TSMC\u2019s 4nm process, Sohu can deliver dramatically better inferencing performance than GPUs and other general-purpose AI chips while drawing less energy, claims Uberti.\n\n\u201cSohu is an order of magnitude faster and cheaper than even Nvidia\u2019s next generation of Blackwell GB200 GPUs when running text, image and video transformers,\u201d Uberti said. \u201cOne Sohu server replaces 160 H100 GPUs. \u2026 Sohu will be a more affordable, efficient and environmentally friendly option for business leaders that need specialized chips.\u201d\n\nHow does Sohu achieve all this? In a few ways, but the most obvious (and intuitive) is a streamlined inferencing hardware-and-software pipeline. Because Sohu doesn\u2019t run non-transformer models, the Etched team could do away with hardware components not relevant to transformers and trim the software overhead traditionally used for deploying and running non-transformers.\n\nA graph from Etched comparing hardware performance running Meta\u2019s open model Llama 70B. Image Credits: Etched\n\nEtched is arriving on the scene at an inflection point in the race for generative AI infrastructure. Beyond cost concerns, the GPUs and other hardware components necessary to run models at scale today are dangerously power-hungry.\n\nGoldman Sachs predicts that AI is poised to drive a 160% increase in data center electricity demand by 2030, contributing to a significant uptick in greenhouse gas emissions. Researchers at UC Riverside, meanwhile, estimate that global AI usage could cause data centers to suck up 1.1 trillion to 1.7 trillion gallons of fresh water by 2027, impacting local resources. (Many data centers use water to cool servers.)\n\nUberti optimistically \u2014 or bombastically, depending on how you interpret it \u2014 pitches Sohu as the solution to the industry\u2019s consumption problem.\n\n\u201cIn short, our future customers won\u2019t be able to afford not to switch to Sohu,\u201d Uberti said. \u201cCompanies are willing to take a bet on Etched because speed and cost are existential to the AI products they are trying to build.\u201d\n\nBut can Etched, assuming it meets its goal of bringing Sohu to the mass market in the next few months, succeed when so many others are following close behind it?\n\nThe company lacks a direct competitor at present, but AI chip startup Perceive recently previewed a processor with hardware acceleration for transformers. Groq has also invested heavily in transformer-specific optimizations for its ASIC.\n\nCompetition aside, what if transformers one day fall out of favor? Uberti says, in that case, Etched will do the obvious: Design a new chip. Fair enough, but that\u2019s a pretty drastic fallback option, considering how long it\u2019s taken to bring Sohu to fruition.\n\nNone of these concerns have dissuaded investors from pouring an enormous amount of money into Etched, though.\n\nToday, Etched said it has closed a $120 million Series A funding round, co-led by Primary Venture Partners and Positive Sum Ventures. Bringing Etched\u2019s total raised to $125.36 million, the round saw participation from heavyweight angel backers including Peter Thiel (Uberti, Zhu and Wachen are Thiel Fellowship alums), GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke, Cruise (and the Bot Company) co-founder Kyle Vogt, and Quora co-founder Charlie Cheever.\n\nThese investors presumably believe Etched has a reasonable chance of successfully scaling up its business of selling servers. Perhaps it does \u2014 Uberti claims unnamed customers have reserved \u201ctens of millions of dollars\u201d in hardware so far. The forthcoming launch of the Sohu Developer Cloud, which will let customers preview Sohu via an online interactive playground, should drive additional sales, Uberti suggested.\n\nStill, it seems too early to tell whether this will be enough to propel Etched and its 35-person team into the future its co-founders are envisioning. The AI chip segment can be unforgiving in the best of times \u2014 see the high-profile near-failures of AI chip startups like Mythic and Graphcore, and the declining investment in AI chip ventures in 2023.\n\nUberti makes a strong sales pitch, though: \u201cVideo generation, audio-to-audio modalities, robotics, and other future AI use cases will only be possible with a faster chip like Sohu. The entire future of AI technology will be shaped by whether the infrastructure can scale.\u201d", "authors": "['Kyle Wiggers']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1425576452.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/etched-is-building-an-ai-chip-that-only-runs-transformer-models/", "timestamp": "1719366213.554847", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "TechWolf raises $43M to take an AI-sized bite out of the internal recruiting game", "text": "Layoffs continue to buffet the world of technology, but with the need for tech talent in organizations only growing, there\u2019s a bigger focus on how internal talent is managed.\n\nA startup from Ghent in Belgium called TechWolf is taking a unique approach to addressing that need. It has built an AI engine that ingests data from internal workflows to learn about the people doing that work. This is then turned into data for managers and internal recruiters to assess various employees\u2019 interests and skills more accurately, help connect them with different projects, and ultimately provide them with better training and more.\n\nThe company is making some waves with its technology, boasting an impressive list of customers that include GSK, HSBC, Booking.com and many others. And now it has raised nearly $43 million ($42.75 million, more precisely) in funding to expand its business.\n\nLondon-based Felix Capital is leading this Series B, while SAP, ServiceNow and Workday \u2014 three titans in HR \u2014 are co-investing alongside each other for the first time ever. Other backers include Acadian Ventures, Fortino Capital Partners, Notion Capital, SemperVirens and 20VC, along with unnamed \u201cAI leaders\u201d from DeepMind and Meta. From what we understand, the startup is now valued around $150 million.\n\nCEO Andreas De Neve, who co-founded TechWolf with Jeroen Van Hautte and Mika\u00ebl Wornoo, started the company in 2018 when the three were still computer science students at the University of Ghent in Belgium and Cambridge in England.\n\nThe original plan was to build an HR platform \u2014 with the startup building its own language model \u201clike ChatGPT,\u201d he said \u2014 to help source and hire talent from outside.\n\n\u201cIt failed,\u201d he said simply. Recruitment, or at least the part of it that they were trying to address, was just not that broken. Employers \u201cdidn\u2019t need AI to filter out the good applicants from the bad.\u201d\n\nBut the founders discovered that their target customers did have a different problem that needed fixing.\n\n\u201cThey said: \u2018Hey, so this AI model, is there any chance we could use it on our 40,000 employees instead of our applicants? Because there might be people who we could recruit internally,\u201d De Neve said. \u201cThe HR leaders pointed us toward the right problem to solve: identifying the skills of employees.\u201d\n\nThe question \u201cWhat is it you actually do?\u201d was a recurring joke about Chandler (an IT worker) on the TV show \u201cFriends.\u201d But it turns out to be a major issue in businesses in the real world, and it gets worse the bigger the organization becomes. \u201cYou can have 100,000 employees that are all super capable, who all spend a lot of time in software systems that create data,\u201d De Neve said. \u201cBut structurally, these companies know very little about these people. So that\u2019s what we set out to do.\u201d\n\nThat is just the kind of problem AI can solve, he said. \u201cWe started building language models that integrate with the systems people use for work: project trackers, documentation systems for developers, research repositories for researchers. And from all that data, we infer what skills those workers have. You can almost think of it as a set of AI models that connect with the digital exhaust of an organization.\u201d\n\nTechWolf touches on a few significant currents in the market right now that are worth noting:\n\nThe real innovators\u2019 dilemma? The seminal book \u201cThe Innovator\u2019s Dilemma\u201d paints a convincing picture of how even the most successful, large companies can be undone by smaller businesses that move more nimbly to respond to change. But looking at this a different way, the core asset that helps one organization work more flexibly than another is its people: How easily teams can be formed around different projects and goals arguably will be what makes or breaks those efforts. And it turns out that organizations are willing to pay good money for tech that can help them with that task.\n\nLLM vs. MLM vs. SLM. \u201cLarge\u201d language models and companies that are building them continue to generate a huge amount of interest. And \u201cgenerate\u201d is really the operative word here, since they are what underpin buzzy generative AI applications like ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, Claude, Suno and more. But there is definitely a rising tide for \u201csmaller\u201d language models that can be applied to very specific use cases, which are potentially less complex to build and operate, and ultimately more constrained and thus less prone to hallucination. TechWolf is not the only company working in this area, nor the only one to be catching the eye of investors. (Another example is the startup Poolside, which is building AI for a specific use case: developers and their coding tasks.)\n\nFocus indeed counts for a lot. I asked De Neve whether TechWolf had any ambitions to leverage the platform to expand into other areas like enterprise search or business intelligence. After all, it is already ingesting so much enterprise information, wouldn\u2019t it be one simple step further to build more products around that?\n\nNon, was De Neve\u2019s flat answer: \u201cWe can process data like nobody else in the market, but we are super, super focused on solving the skills problem, because there\u2019s too much demand for us already, right now, in the market where we operate.\u201d\n\nAt a time when it feels like there is a lot of noise in the world of AI, focus rings like a clear bell and could be one reason why investors are interested in companies like these.\n\nJulien Codorniou, the partner at Felix who led on this deal, believes TechWolf could outmaneuver even much bigger companies coming from other corners like AI-based enterprise search. \u201cDoing one thing well can really pay off,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be Workday or ServiceNow.

It has built an AI engine that ingests data from internal workflows to learn about the people doing that work. This is then turned into data for managers and internal recruiters to assess various employees\u2019 interests and skills more accurately, help connect them with different projects, and ultimately provide them with better training and more.\n\nThe company is making some waves with its technology, boasting an impressive list of customers that include GSK, HSBC, Booking.com and many others. And now it has raised nearly $43 million ($42.75 million, more precisely) in funding to expand its business.\n\nLondon-based Felix Capital is leading this Series B, while SAP, ServiceNow and Workday \u2014 three titans in HR \u2014 are co-investing alongside each other for the first time ever. Other backers include Acadian Ventures, Fortino Capital Partners, Notion Capital, SemperVirens and 20VC, along with unnamed \u201cAI leaders\u201d from DeepMind and Meta. From what we understand, the startup is now valued around $150 million.\n\nCEO Andreas De Neve, who co-founded TechWolf with Jeroen Van Hautte and Mika\u00ebl Wornoo, started the company in 2018 when the three were still computer science students at the University of Ghent in Belgium and Cambridge in England.\n\nThe original plan was to build an HR platform \u2014 with the startup building its own language model \u201clike ChatGPT,\u201d he said \u2014 to help source and hire talent from outside.\n\n\u201cIt failed,\u201d he said simply. Recruitment, or at least the part of it that they were trying to address, was just not that broken. Employers \u201cdidn\u2019t need AI to filter out the good applicants from the bad.\u201d\n\nBut the founders discovered that their target customers did have a different problem that needed fixing.\n\n\u201cThey said: \u2018Hey, so this AI model, is there any chance we could use it on our 40,000 employees instead of our applicants? Because there might be people who we could recruit internally,\u201d De Neve said. \u201cThe HR leaders pointed us toward the right problem to solve: identifying the skills of employees.\u201d\n\nThe question \u201cWhat is it you actually do?\u201d was a recurring joke about Chandler (an IT worker) on the TV show \u201cFriends.\u201d But it turns out to be a major issue in businesses in the real world, and it gets worse the bigger the organization becomes. \u201cYou can have 100,000 employees that are all super capable, who all spend a lot of time in software systems that create data,\u201d De Neve said. \u201cBut structurally, these companies know very little about these people. So that\u2019s what we set out to do.\u201d\n\nThat is just the kind of problem AI can solve, he said. \u201cWe started building language models that integrate with the systems people use for work: project trackers, documentation systems for developers, research repositories for researchers. And from all that data, we infer what skills those workers have. You can almost think of it as a set of AI models that connect with the digital exhaust of an organization.\u201d\n\nTechWolf touches on a few significant currents in the market right now that are worth noting:\n\nThe real innovators\u2019 dilemma? The seminal book \u201cThe Innovator\u2019s Dilemma\u201d paints a convincing picture of how even the most successful, large companies can be undone by smaller businesses that move more nimbly to respond to change. But looking at this a different way, the core asset that helps one organization work more flexibly than another is its people: How easily teams can be formed around different projects and goals arguably will be what makes or breaks those efforts. And it turns out that organizations are willing to pay good money for tech that can help them with that task.\n\nLLM vs. MLM vs. SLM. \u201cLarge\u201d language models and companies that are building them continue to generate a huge amount of interest. And \u201cgenerate\u201d is really the operative word here, since they are what underpin buzzy generative AI applications like ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, Claude, Suno and more. But there is definitely a rising tide for \u201csmaller\u201d language models that can be applied to very specific use cases, which are potentially less complex to build and operate, and ultimately more constrained and thus less prone to hallucination. TechWolf is not the only company working in this area, nor the only one to be catching the eye of investors. (Another example is the startup Poolside, which is building AI for a specific use case: developers and their coding tasks.)\n\nFocus indeed counts for a lot. I asked De Neve whether TechWolf had any ambitions to leverage the platform to expand into other areas like enterprise search or business intelligence. After all, it is already ingesting so much enterprise information, wouldn\u2019t it be one simple step further to build more products around that?\n\nNon, was De Neve\u2019s flat answer: \u201cWe can process data like nobody else in the market, but we are super, super focused on solving the skills problem, because there\u2019s too much demand for us already, right now, in the market where we operate.\u201d\n\nAt a time when it feels like there is a lot of noise in the world of AI, focus rings like a clear bell and could be one reason why investors are interested in companies like these.\n\nJulien Codorniou, the partner at Felix who led on this deal, believes TechWolf could outmaneuver even much bigger companies coming from other corners like AI-based enterprise search. \u201cDoing one thing well can really pay off,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be Workday or ServiceNow. They want to be the Switzerland of the HR department.\u201d", "authors": "['Ingrid Lunden']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/founders-6.jpg?resize=1200,800", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/24/techwolf-raises-43m-to-take-an-ai-sized-bite-out-of-the-internal-recruiting-game/", "timestamp": "1719366238.373448", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "Emergence thinks it can crack the AI agent code", "text": "Yet another generative AI venture has raised a bundle of money. And, like the others before it, it\u2019s promising the moon.\n\nEmergence, whose co-founders include Satya Nitta, the former head of global AI solutions at IBM\u2019s research division, on Monday emerged from stealth with $97.2 million in funding from Learn Capital plus credit lines totaling more than $100 million. Emergence claims to be building an \u201cagent-based\u201d system that can perform many of the tasks typically handled by knowledge workers, in part by routing these tasks to first- and third-party generative AI models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o.\n\n\u201cAt Emergence, we are working on multiple aspects of the evolving field of generative AI agents,\u201d Nitta, Emergence\u2019s CEO, told TechCrunch. \u201cIn our R&D labs, we are advancing the science of agentic systems and tackling this from a \u2018first principles\u2019 perspective. This includes critical AI tasks such as planning and reasoning as well as self-improvement in agents.\u201d\n\nNitta says that the idea for Emergence came shortly after he co-founded Merlyn Mind, which builds education-oriented virtual assistants. He realized that some of the same technologies developed at Merlyn could be applied to automate workstation software and web apps.\n\nSo Nitta recruited fellow ex-IBMers Ravi Kokku and Sharad Sundararajan to launch Emergence, with the goal of \u201cadvancing the science and development of AI agents,\u201d in Nitta\u2019s words.\n\n\u201cCurrent generative AI models, while powerful in language understanding, still lag in advanced planning and reasoning capabilities necessary for more complex automation tasks which are the provenance of agents,\u201d Nitta said. \u201cThis is what Emergence specializes in.\u201d\n\nEmergence has a very aspirational roadmap that includes a project called Agent E, which seeks to automate tasks like filling out forms, searching for products across online marketplaces and navigating streaming services like Netflix. An early form of Agent E is already available, trained on a mix of synthetic and human-annotated data. But Emergence\u2019s first finished product is what Nitta describes as an \u201corchestrator\u201d agent.\n\nThis orchestrator, open sourced Monday, doesn\u2019t perform any tasks itself. Rather, it functions as a kind of automatic model switcher for workflow automations. Factoring in things like the capabilities of and the cost to use a model (if it\u2019s third party), the orchestrator considers the task to be performed \u2014 for example, writing an email \u2014 then chooses a model from a developer-curated list to complete that task.\n\nAn early version of Emergence\u2019s Agent E project. Image Credits: Emergence\n\n\u201cDevelopers can add appropriate guardrails, use multiple models for their workflows and applications, and seamlessly switch to the latest open source or generalist model on demand without having to worry about issues such as cost, prompt migration or availability,\u201d Nitta said.\n\nEmergence\u2019s orchestrator seems quite similar in concept to AI startup Martian\u2019s model router, which takes in a prompt intended for an AI model and automatically routes it to different models depending on things like uptime and features. Another startup, Credal, provides a more basic model-routing solution driven by hard-coded rules.\n\nNitta doesn\u2019t deny the similarities. But he not-so-subtly suggests that Emergence\u2019s model-routing tech is more reliable than others; he also notes that it offers additional configuration features like a manual model selector, API management and a cost overview dashboard.\n\n\u201cOur orchestrator agent is built with a deep understanding of scalability, robustness and availability that enterprise systems need and is backed by decades of experience that our team possesses in building some of the most scaled AI deployments in the world,\u201d he said.\n\nEmergence intends to monetize the orchestrator with a hosted, available-through-an-API premium version in the coming weeks. But that\u2019s only a slice of the company\u2019s grand plan to build a platform that, among other things, processes claims and documents, manages IT systems, and integrates with customer relationship management systems like Salesforce and Zendesk to triage customer inquiries.\n\nToward this end, Emergence says it\u2019s formed strategic partnerships with Samsung and touch display company Newline Interactive \u2014 both of which are existing Merlyn Mind customers, in what seems unlikely to be a coincidence \u2014 to integrate Emergence\u2019s tech into future products.\n\nAnother screenshot of Emergence\u2019s Agent E in action. Image Credits: Emergence\n\nWhich specific products and when can we expect to see them? Samsung\u2019s WAD interactive displays and Newline\u2019s Q and Q Pro series displays, Nitta said, but he didn\u2019t have an answer to the second question, implying that it\u2019s very early days.\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that AI agents are buzzy right now. Generative AI powerhouses OpenAI and Anthropic are developing task-performing agentic products, as are Big Tech companies, including Google and Amazon.\n\nBut it\u2019s not obvious where Emergence\u2019s differentiation lies, besides the sizable amount of cash out of the starting gate.\n\nTechCrunch recently covered another AI agent startup, Orby, with a similar sales pitch: AI agents trained to work across a range of desktop software. Adept, too, was developing tech along these lines, but despite raising more than $415 million reportedly now finds itself on the brink of a bailout from either Microsoft or Meta.\n\nEmergence is positioning itself as more R&D-heavy than most: the \u201cOpenAI of agents,\u201d if you will, with a research lab dedicated to investigating how agents might plan, reason and self-improve. And it\u2019s drawing from an impressive talent pool; many of its researchers and software engineers hail from Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and the Allen Institute for AI.\n\nNitta says that Emergence\u2019s guiding light will be prioritizing openly available work while building paid services on top of its research, a playbook borrowed from the software-as-a-service sector. Tens of thousands of people are already using early versions of Emergence\u2019s services, he claims.\n\n\u201cOur conviction is that our work becomes foundational to how multiple enterprise workflows get automated in the future,\u201d Nitta said.\n\nColor me skeptical, but I\u2019m not convinced that Emergence\u2019s 50-person team can outgun the rest of the players in the generative AI space \u2014 nor that it\u2019ll solve the overarching technical challenges plaguing generative AI, like hallucinations and the mammoth cost of developing models. Cognition Labs\u2019 Devin, one of the best-performing agents for building and deploying software, only manages to get around a 14% success rate on a benchmark test measuring the ability to resolve issues on GitHub. There\u2019s clearly a lot of work to be done to reach the point where agents can juggle complex processes without oversight.\n\nEmergence has the capital to try \u2014 for now. But it might not in the future as VCs \u2014 and businesses \u2014 express increased skepticism in generative AI tech\u2019s path to ROI.\n\nNitta, projecting the confidence of someone whose startup just raised $100 million, asserted that Emergence is well-positioned for success.\n\n\u201cEmergence is resilient due to its focus on solving fundamental AI infrastructure problems that have a clear and immediate ROI for enterprises,\u201d he said. \u201cOur open-core business model, combined with premium services, ensures a steady revenue stream while fostering a growing community of developers and early adopters.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll see soon enough.", "authors": "['Kyle Wiggers']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nice-A1-Key-Alt-4.jpeg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/24/emergence-thinks-it-can-crack-the-ai-agent-code/", "timestamp": "1719366242.8473642", "displayed": 0}

It was a privilege building with you, and we learned a ton from you.\u201d\n\nWith Multi, Embiricos (an ex-Dropbox product manager) and Multi\u2019s second co-founder, Charley Ho (an ex-Google software engineer), set out to build a Zoom-based platform designed for remote teams to work together through video chats. Multi offered features like the ability to collaborate across screen shares from up to 10 people at the same time, customizable shortcuts and automatic deep links for code, designs and documents.\n\nExcited to share that Multi has been acquired by OpenAI!\n\n\n\nTo everyone who used Multi, submitted feedback and offered feature suggestions, Thank You. https://t.co/KU0AroW1tQ \u2014 Charley Ho (@potatoarecool) June 24, 2024\n\nAccording to Crunchbase data, Multi raised $13 million in cash from VCs including Greylock and First Round Capital prior to Monday\u2019s exit.\n\nAs with the Rockset buy, the Multi deal seems to fit into OpenAI\u2019s broader recent strategy of investing heavily in enterprise solutions. OpenAI recently revealed that the corporate tier of its viral AI-powered chatbot platform, ChatGPT, had close to 600,000 users, including 93% of all Fortune 500 firms.\n\nIn May, OpenAI signed an agreement with PwC to resell OpenAI\u2019s tools to other businesses. The month before, the company launched a business-oriented custom AI model tuning and consulting program.\n\nThe enterprise buys appear to be paying dividends, with OpenAI\u2019s revenue set to eclipse $3.4 billion this year, per The Information.\n\nAlong the same vein as OpenAI\u2019s other corporate-aimed product efforts, could we one day see a spruced-up ChatGPT with videoconferencing and remote collaboration capabilities? Maybe. I wouldn\u2019t put it past OpenAI \u2014 particularly as the lag time between the org\u2019s flagship models lengthens.", "authors": "['Kyle Wiggers']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/OpenAI-and-ChatGPT.jpeg?resize=1200,676", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/24/openai-buys-a-remote-collaboration-platform/", "timestamp": "1719366255.421599", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "\u200b\u200bWhat Vinod Khosla says he\u2019s \u2018worried about the most\u2019", "text": "Vinod Khosla is more popular than ever right now. The Sun Microsystems co-founder turned prominent investor \u2014 first at Kleiner Perkins and, for the last 20 years, at his venture firm Khosla Ventures \u2014 has always been sought after by founders thanks to his no-nonsense advice and his firm\u2019s track record, including bets on Stripe, Square, Affirm, and DoorDash. But a $50 million gamble on OpenAI back in 2019 \u2014 when it was far from clear that the outfit would succeed on the scale that it has \u2014 put Khosla Ventures, and Khosla himself, squarely in the spotlight.\n\nHe\u2019s thoroughly enjoying himself. I sat down with Khosla this past week in Toronto at the Collision conference, and ahead of our stage appearance, he told me that he\u2019s been appearing in public \u2014 either onstage or on podcasts or television interviews \u2014 several times a week lately. Asked if he was exhausted by the schedule \u2014 for example, he flew into Toronto just hours before our sit-down \u2014 he shrugged off the suggestion.\n\nCertainly, there are things he prefers to talk about, and the art of deal-making is not among these things. \u201cFrankly, the investor side is much less interesting to me,\u201d he said when I asked him about something I heard recently, which is that he hasn\u2019t taken a dollar in management fees since starting Khosla Ventures, despite that it now has $18 billion in assets under management. (He confirmed this, but he said that\u2019s only true of himself and not a corporate-wide policy.)\n\nHe\u2019s much more passionate about the startup opportunities he spies in a landscape being changed daily by advances in AI, so we talked about some of this white space. We also talked about what concerns him the most about AI\u2019s ripple effects; FTC Chair Lina Khan; and why, in his view, the \u201cEuropeans have regulated themselves out of leading in any technology area.\u201d\n\nWe talked first about Apple\u2019s splashy new deal with OpenAI, which allows Apple to integrate ChatGPT into Siri and its generative AI tools. Apple may be striking similar deals with other AI models, including with Meta, but naturally, as an OpenAI investor, Khosla is bullish on the tie-up, which is the only one Apple has announced publicly so far.\n\nKhosla called it \u201cvalidation\u201d for OpenAI; by announcing its pact with OpenAI during its high-profile developers\u2019 conference, Apple was also \u201cexpressing confidence, I believe, in [OpenAI CEO] Sam [Altman] to lead [developments in AI] the next five or 10 years,\u201d said Khosla. \u201cWhen a company like Apple bets on a technology, they don\u2019t change it the next year usually.\u201d\n\nBut was it good news and also bad news for Khosla, I wondered? As we\u2019ve noted in TechCrunch, many startups will likely be disrupted right out of existence by some of Apple\u2019s newest features, and it seemed likely that Khosla\u2019s portfolio companies aren\u2019t entirely immune. I was especially curious about Rabbit, whose AI-powered hardware device promises to be a kind of AI assistant to users and is backed by Khosla Ventures.\n\nVinod Khosla onstage at Collision with TechCrunch editor-in-chief Connie Loizos. Image Credits: Vaughn Ridley / Collision\n\nAsked if the device could be made obsolete by Apple, Khosla suggested the device is more flexible than people imagine and could wind up being used by enterprises like hospitals, including in emergency room environments. He put it in the growing array of things that will \u201cwatch what you do, see what you do, and respond automatically.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Khosla suggested that his team has actively avoided anything that could become \u201croadkill\u201d as large language models like that of OpenAI progress further. And he highlighted at least one company that\u2019s not in his portfolio: Grammarly, a writing assistant startup that was valued by its backers not so long ago at $13 billion.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re doing Grammarly, say, it\u2019s really a light wrapper on today\u2019s model, and Grammarly won\u2019t keep up; it should never have been an app. It shows the need for that capability, but it will be part of Word or Google Docs. It\u2019s pretty obvious. When we talk to YC companies or others,\u201d Khosla continued, \u201cI can usually say, \u2018Half of these companies will be obsolete before the YC batch is over.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhere Khosla sees plenty of opportunities are in verticals where expertise will become near free, although it\u2019s not clear to me how these companies will sustainably make money (even after asking him). Think tutoring, or even oncology.\n\nSaid Khosla: \u201cOpen AI or Google isn\u2019t going to build a chip designer [to have on your smartphone]. OpenAI and Google aren\u2019t going to build a structural engineer. They\u2019re not going to build a primary care doctor or a mental health therapist,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there are so many areas for [founders to mine]. But they have to look at where the models are going next year and five years from now, and say, \u2018We want to leverage that capability.\u2019\u201d\n\nWe also talked about regulation. I observed that Khosla has said before that closed large language models like that of OpenAI should be safeguarded, even while there should be a regulatory framework around them. I wondered if that means that Khosla will forever forswear other, \u201copen source\u201d AI.\n\nNot at all, he said, noting that he\u2019s a \u201chuge fan\u201d of open source. Sun was one of the first companies to \u201cjump on open source,\u201d opening sourcing its file system, he said. He also noted that Khosla Ventures was the earliest investor in GitLab, whose software invites people to work on code jointly.\n\nBut he suggested that open source in the context of large language models is a different animal altogether. The \u201clargest risk we face with AI is China\u201d and \u201cpowerful Chinese AI\u201d that competes with the \u201cliberal values\u201d of the U.S., he said, adding that \u201cwe need to make sure that China stays behind us.\u201d Otherwise, he warned, it will be China providing the \u201cfree doctors and free oncologists\u201d to the rest of the world and, while they are at it, they\u2019ll \u201cexport both the economic power that comes with AI and their political philosophy.\u201d\n\nOnstage, I mentioned to Khosla my recent sit-down with FTC Chair Lina Khan, who does not believe in the national champions model as a reason to coddle outfits like Google or OpenAI as they further their development of AI.\n\nKhan hears all the time from executives and investors who say that government intervention will put the U.S. on a dangerous path. But during my sit-down with Khan, she argued that time and again, the U.S. has chosen \u201cthe path of competition\u201d and it has \u201cended up fueling and catalyzing so many of these breakthrough innovations and so much of the remarkable growth that our country has enjoyed and that has allowed us to stay ahead globally.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you look at some other countries that instead chose that national champions model,\u201d Khan added at the time, \u201cthey\u2019re the ones who got left behind.\u201d\n\nI had barely mentioned Khan, however, when Khosla became dismissive, calling her \u201cnot a rational human being\u201d and accusing her of not understanding business.\n\nA close-up shot of Vinod Khosla at the Collision conference. Image Credits: Vaughn Ridley / Collison\n\n\u201c[Khan] shouldn\u2019t be in that role,\u201d said Khosla. \u201cAntitrust is a good thing to have in any country, any economic system. But antitrust [that\u2019s] over enforced or over executed is bad economic policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne thing the U.S. has over its European rivals is much more rational business environments. That\u2019s why the Europeans have regulated themselves out of leading in any technology area; they just basically have regulated themselves out of AI, out of all social media, out of all internet startups,\u201d he said.\n\nOf course, if some antitrust enforcement is good, but too much is not good, the question is where to draw the line. On this point, before we parted ways, I brought up the \u201cabundance\u201d that Altman foresees created by AI. During one of TechCrunch\u2019s StrictlyVC events last year, Altman said that the \u201cgood case\u201d for AI is \u201cjust so unbelievably good that you sound like a really crazy person to start talking about it.\u201d\n\nKhosla has said he believes the same. But I\u2019ve long wondered how, exactly, society will enjoy all this upside if regulators don\u2019t get more involved in the trajectory of these companies. After all, I told Khosla onstage, we\u2019ve already seen a massive aggregation of wealth and power tied to a smaller and smaller group of companies and individuals. When will enough be enough?\n\nHere, Khosla said the issue bothers him greatly. \u201cI think 25 years from now, when I hope I\u2019m still working \u2026 the need to work will mostly disappear.\u201d Still, while AI should create \u201cgreat abundance, great GDP growth, great productivity \u2014 all the things economists measure,\u201d he said, he worries \u201cmore than anything else\u201d about \u201cincreasing income disparity. How do we [ensure the] equitable distribution of the benefits of AI?\u201d\n\nHe has an inkling where the tipping point might be. \u201cIf [U.S] GDP growth goes from 2% today \u2014 it\u2019s less than 1% in Europe right now \u2014 to 4%, 5%, 6%, we\u2019ll have enough abundance to share the wealth and share the benefits.\u201d\n\nWhether and how that happens, of course, are even bigger questions, and for all his brilliance, Khosla, a self-described techno optimist, didn\u2019t have the answers.\n\nInstead, after one last closing remark, he thanked the crowd for their time. Then he walked offstage, where a dozen young founders were gathered in the wings, each of them hoping to bend his ear for as long as they could.", "authors": "['Connie Loizos']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/53800655026_a615ec2ef8_k.jpg?resize=1200,800", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/23/what-vinod-khosla-says-hes-worried-about-the-most/", "timestamp": "1719366274.4198", "displayed": 0}

Asked if he was exhausted by the schedule \u2014 for example, he flew into Toronto just hours before our sit-down \u2014 he shrugged off the suggestion.\n\nCertainly, there are things he prefers to talk about, and the art of deal-making is not among these things. \u201cFrankly, the investor side is much less interesting to me,\u201d he said when I asked him about something I heard recently, which is that he hasn\u2019t taken a dollar in management fees since starting Khosla Ventures, despite that it now has $18 billion in assets under management. (He confirmed this, but he said that\u2019s only true of himself and not a corporate-wide policy.)\n\nHe\u2019s much more passionate about the startup opportunities he spies in a landscape being changed daily by advances in AI, so we talked about some of this white space. We also talked about what concerns him the most about AI\u2019s ripple effects; FTC Chair Lina Khan; and why, in his view, the \u201cEuropeans have regulated themselves out of leading in any technology area.\u201d\n\nWe talked first about Apple\u2019s splashy new deal with OpenAI, which allows Apple to integrate ChatGPT into Siri and its generative AI tools. Apple may be striking similar deals with other AI models, including with Meta, but naturally, as an OpenAI investor, Khosla is bullish on the tie-up, which is the only one Apple has announced publicly so far.\n\nKhosla called it \u201cvalidation\u201d for OpenAI; by announcing its pact with OpenAI during its high-profile developers\u2019 conference, Apple was also \u201cexpressing confidence, I believe, in [OpenAI CEO] Sam [Altman] to lead [developments in AI] the next five or 10 years,\u201d said Khosla. \u201cWhen a company like Apple bets on a technology, they don\u2019t change it the next year usually.\u201d\n\nBut was it good news and also bad news for Khosla, I wondered? As we\u2019ve noted in TechCrunch, many startups will likely be disrupted right out of existence by some of Apple\u2019s newest features, and it seemed likely that Khosla\u2019s portfolio companies aren\u2019t entirely immune. I was especially curious about Rabbit, whose AI-powered hardware device promises to be a kind of AI assistant to users and is backed by Khosla Ventures.\n\nVinod Khosla onstage at Collision with TechCrunch editor-in-chief Connie Loizos. Image Credits: Vaughn Ridley / Collision\n\nAsked if the device could be made obsolete by Apple, Khosla suggested the device is more flexible than people imagine and could wind up being used by enterprises like hospitals, including in emergency room environments. He put it in the growing array of things that will \u201cwatch what you do, see what you do, and respond automatically.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Khosla suggested that his team has actively avoided anything that could become \u201croadkill\u201d as large language models like that of OpenAI progress further. And he highlighted at least one company that\u2019s not in his portfolio: Grammarly, a writing assistant startup that was valued by its backers not so long ago at $13 billion.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re doing Grammarly, say, it\u2019s really a light wrapper on today\u2019s model, and Grammarly won\u2019t keep up; it should never have been an app. It shows the need for that capability, but it will be part of Word or Google Docs. It\u2019s pretty obvious. When we talk to YC companies or others,\u201d Khosla continued, \u201cI can usually say, \u2018Half of these companies will be obsolete before the YC batch is over.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhere Khosla sees plenty of opportunities are in verticals where expertise will become near free, although it\u2019s not clear to me how these companies will sustainably make money (even after asking him). Think tutoring, or even oncology.\n\nSaid Khosla: \u201cOpen AI or Google isn\u2019t going to build a chip designer [to have on your smartphone]. OpenAI and Google aren\u2019t going to build a structural engineer. They\u2019re not going to build a primary care doctor or a mental health therapist,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there are so many areas for [founders to mine]. But they have to look at where the models are going next year and five years from now, and say, \u2018We want to leverage that capability.\u2019\u201d\n\nWe also talked about regulation. I observed that Khosla has said before that closed large language models like that of OpenAI should be safeguarded, even while there should be a regulatory framework around them. I wondered if that means that Khosla will forever forswear other, \u201copen source\u201d AI.\n\nNot at all, he said, noting that he\u2019s a \u201chuge fan\u201d of open source. Sun was one of the first companies to \u201cjump on open source,\u201d opening sourcing its file system, he said. He also noted that Khosla Ventures was the earliest investor in GitLab, whose software invites people to work on code jointly.\n\nBut he suggested that open source in the context of large language models is a different animal altogether. The \u201clargest risk we face with AI is China\u201d and \u201cpowerful Chinese AI\u201d that competes with the \u201cliberal values\u201d of the U.S., he said, adding that \u201cwe need to make sure that China stays behind us.\u201d Otherwise, he warned, it will be China providing the \u201cfree doctors and free oncologists\u201d to the rest of the world and, while they are at it, they\u2019ll \u201cexport both the economic power that comes with AI and their political philosophy.\u201d\n\nOnstage, I mentioned to Khosla my recent sit-down with FTC Chair Lina Khan, who does not believe in the national champions model as a reason to coddle outfits like Google or OpenAI as they further their development of AI.\n\nKhan hears all the time from executives and investors who say that government intervention will put the U.S. on a dangerous path. But during my sit-down with Khan, she argued that time and again, the U.S. has chosen \u201cthe path of competition\u201d and it has \u201cended up fueling and catalyzing so many of these breakthrough innovations and so much of the remarkable growth that our country has enjoyed and that has allowed us to stay ahead globally.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you look at some other countries that instead chose that national champions model,\u201d Khan added at the time, \u201cthey\u2019re the ones who got left behind.\u201d\n\nI had barely mentioned Khan, however, when Khosla became dismissive, calling her \u201cnot a rational human being\u201d and accusing her of not understanding business.\n\nA close-up shot of Vinod Khosla at the Collision conference. Image Credits: Vaughn Ridley / Collison\n\n\u201c[Khan] shouldn\u2019t be in that role,\u201d said Khosla. \u201cAntitrust is a good thing to have in any country, any economic system. But antitrust [that\u2019s] over enforced or over executed is bad economic policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne thing the U.S. has over its European rivals is much more rational business environments. That\u2019s why the Europeans have regulated themselves out of leading in any technology area; they just basically have regulated themselves out of AI, out of all social media, out of all internet startups,\u201d he said.\n\nOf course, if some antitrust enforcement is good, but too much is not good, the question is where to draw the line. On this point, before we parted ways, I brought up the \u201cabundance\u201d that Altman foresees created by AI. During one of TechCrunch\u2019s StrictlyVC events last year, Altman said that the \u201cgood case\u201d for AI is \u201cjust so unbelievably good that you sound like a really crazy person to start talking about it.\u201d\n\nKhosla has said he believes the same. But I\u2019ve long wondered how, exactly, society will enjoy all this upside if regulators don\u2019t get more involved in the trajectory of these companies. After all, I told Khosla onstage, we\u2019ve already seen a massive aggregation of wealth and power tied to a smaller and smaller group of companies and individuals. When will enough be enough?\n\nHere, Khosla said the issue bothers him greatly. \u201cI think 25 years from now, when I hope I\u2019m still working \u2026 the need to work will mostly disappear.\u201d Still, while AI should create \u201cgreat abundance, great GDP growth, great productivity \u2014 all the things economists measure,\u201d he said, he worries \u201cmore than anything else\u201d about \u201cincreasing income disparity. How do we [ensure the] equitable distribution of the benefits of AI?\u201d\n\nHe has an inkling where the tipping point might be. \u201cIf [U.S] GDP growth goes from 2% today \u2014 it\u2019s less than 1% in Europe right now \u2014 to 4%, 5%, 6%, we\u2019ll have enough abundance to share the wealth and share the benefits.\u201d\n\nWhether and how that happens, of course, are even bigger questions, and for all his brilliance, Khosla, a self-described techno optimist, didn\u2019t have the answers.\n\nInstead, after one last closing remark, he thanked the crowd for their time. Then he walked offstage, where a dozen young founders were gathered in the wings, each of them hoping to bend his ear for as long as they could.", "authors": "['Connie Loizos']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/53800655026_a615ec2ef8_k.jpg?resize=1200,800", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/23/what-vinod-khosla-says-hes-worried-about-the-most/", "timestamp": "1719366277.372843", "displayed": 0}

Previously, she worked as a race and technology practitioner fellow at the Stanford Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society. Before this, she led Trust & Safety at Twitch and Twitter. Navaroli is perhaps best known for her congressional testimony about Twitter, where she spoke about the ignored warnings of impending violence on social media that prefaced what would become the January 6 Capitol attack.\n\nBriefly, how did you get your start in AI? What attracted you to the field?\n\nAbout 20 years ago, I was working as a copy clerk in the newsroom of my hometown paper during the summer when it went digital. Back then, I was an undergrad studying journalism. Social media sites like Facebook were sweeping over my campus, and I became obsessed with trying to understand how laws built on the printing press would evolve with emerging technologies. That curiosity led me through law school, where I migrated to Twitter, studied media law and policy, and I watched the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street movements play out. I put it all together and wrote my master\u2019s thesis about how new technology was transforming the way information flowed and how society exercised freedom of expression.\n\nI worked at a couple law firms after graduation and then found my way to Data & Society Research Institute leading the new think tank\u2019s research on what was then called \u201cbig data,\u201d civil rights, and fairness. My work there looked at how early AI systems like facial recognition software, predictive policing tools, and criminal justice risk assessment algorithms were replicating bias and creating unintended consequences that impacted marginalized communities. I then went on to work at Color of Change and lead the first civil rights audit of a tech company, develop the organization\u2019s playbook for tech accountability campaigns, and advocate for tech policy changes to governments and regulators. From there, I became a senior policy official inside Trust & Safety teams at Twitter and Twitch.\n\nWhat work are you most proud of in the AI field?\n\nI am the most proud of my work inside of technology companies using policy to practically shift the balance of power and correct bias within culture and knowledge-producing algorithmic systems. At Twitter, I ran a couple campaigns to verify individuals who shockingly had been previously excluded from the exclusive verification process, including Black women, people of color, and queer folks. This also included leading AI scholars like Safiya Noble, Alondra Nelson, Timnit Gebru, and Meredith Broussard. This was in 2020 when Twitter was still Twitter. Back then, verification meant that your name and content became a part of Twitter\u2019s core algorithm because tweets from verified accounts were injected into recommendations, search results, home timelines, and contributed toward the creation of trends. So working to verify new people with different perspectives on AI fundamentally shifted whose voices were given authority as thought leaders and elevated new ideas into the public conversation during some really critical moments.\n\nI\u2019m also very proud of the research I conducted at Stanford that came together as Black in Moderation. When I was working inside of tech companies, I also noticed that no one was really writing or talking about the experiences that I was having every day as a Black person working in Trust & Safety. So when I left the industry and went back into academia, I decided to speak with Black tech workers and bring to light their stories. The research ended up being the first of its kind and has spurred so many new and important conversations about the experiences of tech employees with marginalized identities.\n\nHow do you navigate the challenges of the male-dominated tech industry and, by extension, the male-dominated AI industry?\n\nAs a Black queer woman, navigating male-dominated spaces and spaces where I am othered has been a part of my entire life journey. Within tech and AI, I think the most challenging aspect has been what I call in my research \u201ccompelled identity labor.\u201d I coined the term to describe frequent situations where employees with marginalized identities are treated as the voices and/or representatives of entire communities who share their identities.\n\nBecause of the high stakes that come with developing new technology like AI, that labor can sometimes feel almost impossible to escape. I had to learn to set very specific boundaries for myself about what issues I was willing to engage with and when.\n\nWhat are some of the most pressing issues facing AI as it evolves?\n\nAccording to investigative reporting, current generative AI models have gobbled up all the data on the internet and will soon run out of available data to devour. So the largest AI companies in the world are turning to synthetic data, or information generated by AI itself, rather than humans, to continue to train their systems.\n\nThe idea took me down a rabbit hole. So, I recently wrote an Op-Ed arguing that I think this use of synthetic data as training data is one of the most pressing ethical issues facing new AI development. Generative AI systems have already shown that based on their original training data, their output is to replicate bias and create false information. So the pathway of training new systems with synthetic data would mean constantly feeding biased and inaccurate outputs back into the system as new training data. I described this as potentially devolving into a feedback loop to hell.\n\nSince I wrote the piece, Mark Zuckerberg lauded that Meta\u2019s updated Llama 3 chatbot was partially powered by synthetic data and was the \u201cmost intelligent\u201d generative AI product on the market.\n\nWhat are some issues AI users should be aware of?\n\nAI is such an omnipresent part of our present lives, from spellcheck and social media feeds to chatbots and image generators. In many ways, society has become the guinea pig for the experiments of this new, untested technology. But AI users shouldn\u2019t feel powerless.\n\nI\u2019ve been arguing that technology advocates should come together and organize AI users to call for a People Pause on AI. I think that the Writers Guild of America has shown that with organization, collective action, and patient resolve, people can come together to create meaningful boundaries for the use of AI technologies. I also believe that if we pause now to fix the mistakes of the past and create new ethical guidelines and regulation, AI doesn\u2019t have to become an existential threat to our futures.\n\nWhat is the best way to responsibly build AI?\n\nMy experience working inside of tech companies showed me how much it matters who is in the room writing policies, presenting arguments, and making decisions. My pathway also showed me that I developed the skills I needed to succeed within the technology industry by starting in journalism school. I\u2019m now back working at Columbia Journalism School and I am interested in training up the next generation of people who will do the work of technology accountability and responsibly developing AI both inside of tech companies and as external watchdogs.\n\nI think [journalism] school gives people such unique training in interrogating information, seeking truth, considering multiple viewpoints, creating logical arguments, and distilling facts and reality from opinion and misinformation. I believe that\u2019s a solid foundation for the people who will be responsible for writing the rules for what the next iterations of AI can and cannot do. And I\u2019m looking forward to creating a more paved pathway for those who come next.\n\nI also believe that in addition to skilled Trust & Safety workers, the AI industry needs external regulation. In the U.S., I argue that this should come in the form of a new agency to regulate American technology companies with the power to establish and enforce baseline safety and privacy standards. I\u2019d also like to continue to work to connect current and future regulators with former tech workers who can help those in power ask the right questions and create new nuanced and practical solutions.", "authors": "['Dominic-Madori Davis']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/women-in-ai-navaroli.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/23/women-in-ai-anika-collier-navaroli-is-working-to-shift-the-power-imbalance/", "timestamp": "1719366286.8751402", "displayed": 0}

From there, I became a senior policy official inside Trust & Safety teams at Twitter and Twitch.\n\nWhat work are you most proud of in the AI field?\n\nI am the most proud of my work inside of technology companies using policy to practically shift the balance of power and correct bias within culture and knowledge-producing algorithmic systems. At Twitter, I ran a couple campaigns to verify individuals who shockingly had been previously excluded from the exclusive verification process, including Black women, people of color, and queer folks. This also included leading AI scholars like Safiya Noble, Alondra Nelson, Timnit Gebru, and Meredith Broussard. This was in 2020 when Twitter was still Twitter. Back then, verification meant that your name and content became a part of Twitter\u2019s core algorithm because tweets from verified accounts were injected into recommendations, search results, home timelines, and contributed toward the creation of trends. So working to verify new people with different perspectives on AI fundamentally shifted whose voices were given authority as thought leaders and elevated new ideas into the public conversation during some really critical moments.\n\nI\u2019m also very proud of the research I conducted at Stanford that came together as Black in Moderation. When I was working inside of tech companies, I also noticed that no one was really writing or talking about the experiences that I was having every day as a Black person working in Trust & Safety. So when I left the industry and went back into academia, I decided to speak with Black tech workers and bring to light their stories. The research ended up being the first of its kind and has spurred so many new and important conversations about the experiences of tech employees with marginalized identities.\n\nHow do you navigate the challenges of the male-dominated tech industry and, by extension, the male-dominated AI industry?\n\nAs a Black queer woman, navigating male-dominated spaces and spaces where I am othered has been a part of my entire life journey. Within tech and AI, I think the most challenging aspect has been what I call in my research \u201ccompelled identity labor.\u201d I coined the term to describe frequent situations where employees with marginalized identities are treated as the voices and/or representatives of entire communities who share their identities.\n\nBecause of the high stakes that come with developing new technology like AI, that labor can sometimes feel almost impossible to escape. I had to learn to set very specific boundaries for myself about what issues I was willing to engage with and when.\n\nWhat are some of the most pressing issues facing AI as it evolves?\n\nAccording to investigative reporting, current generative AI models have gobbled up all the data on the internet and will soon run out of available data to devour. So the largest AI companies in the world are turning to synthetic data, or information generated by AI itself, rather than humans, to continue to train their systems.\n\nThe idea took me down a rabbit hole. So, I recently wrote an Op-Ed arguing that I think this use of synthetic data as training data is one of the most pressing ethical issues facing new AI development. Generative AI systems have already shown that based on their original training data, their output is to replicate bias and create false information. So the pathway of training new systems with synthetic data would mean constantly feeding biased and inaccurate outputs back into the system as new training data. I described this as potentially devolving into a feedback loop to hell.\n\nSince I wrote the piece, Mark Zuckerberg lauded that Meta\u2019s updated Llama 3 chatbot was partially powered by synthetic data and was the \u201cmost intelligent\u201d generative AI product on the market.\n\nWhat are some issues AI users should be aware of?\n\nAI is such an omnipresent part of our present lives, from spellcheck and social media feeds to chatbots and image generators. In many ways, society has become the guinea pig for the experiments of this new, untested technology. But AI users shouldn\u2019t feel powerless.\n\nI\u2019ve been arguing that technology advocates should come together and organize AI users to call for a People Pause on AI. I think that the Writers Guild of America has shown that with organization, collective action, and patient resolve, people can come together to create meaningful boundaries for the use of AI technologies. I also believe that if we pause now to fix the mistakes of the past and create new ethical guidelines and regulation, AI doesn\u2019t have to become an existential threat to our futures.\n\nWhat is the best way to responsibly build AI?\n\nMy experience working inside of tech companies showed me how much it matters who is in the room writing policies, presenting arguments, and making decisions. My pathway also showed me that I developed the skills I needed to succeed within the technology industry by starting in journalism school. I\u2019m now back working at Columbia Journalism School and I am interested in training up the next generation of people who will do the work of technology accountability and responsibly developing AI both inside of tech companies and as external watchdogs.\n\nI think [journalism] school gives people such unique training in interrogating information, seeking truth, considering multiple viewpoints, creating logical arguments, and distilling facts and reality from opinion and misinformation. I believe that\u2019s a solid foundation for the people who will be responsible for writing the rules for what the next iterations of AI can and cannot do. And I\u2019m looking forward to creating a more paved pathway for those who come next.\n\nI also believe that in addition to skilled Trust & Safety workers, the AI industry needs external regulation. In the U.S., I argue that this should come in the form of a new agency to regulate American technology companies with the power to establish and enforce baseline safety and privacy standards. I\u2019d also like to continue to work to connect current and future regulators with former tech workers who can help those in power ask the right questions and create new nuanced and practical solutions.", "authors": "['Dominic-Madori Davis']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/women-in-ai-navaroli.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/23/women-in-ai-anika-collier-navaroli-is-working-to-shift-the-power-imbalance/", "timestamp": "1719366291.016536", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "Apple might partner with Meta on AI", "text": "As Apple enters the AI race, it\u2019s also looking for help from partners.\n\nDuring the announcement of Apple Intelligence earlier this month, Apple said it would be partnering with OpenAI to bring ChatGPT into the revamped version of Siri. Now the Wall Street Journal reports that Apple and Facebook\u2019s parent company Meta are in talks around a similar deal.\n\nThese talks have reportedly not been finalized and could still fall through. Meta declined to comment; Apple did not immediately respond.\n\nAs Sarah Perez noted, Apple\u2019s approach to AI currently sounds a bit boring and practical \u2014 rather than treating this as an opportunity for wholesale reinvention or disruption, it\u2019s starting out by adding AI-powered features (like writing suggestions and custom emojis) to its existing products. But emphasizing practicality over flashiness might be the key to AI adoption. Then Apple can leverage partnerships to go beyond the capabilities of its own AI models.\n\nSo a deal with Meta could make Apple less reliant on a single partner, while also providing validation for Meta\u2019s generative AI tech.

{"title": "Apple might partner with Meta on AI", "text": "As Apple enters the AI race, it\u2019s also looking for help from partners.\n\nDuring the announcement of Apple Intelligence earlier this month, Apple said it would be partnering with OpenAI to bring ChatGPT into the revamped version of Siri. Now the Wall Street Journal reports that Apple and Facebook\u2019s parent company Meta are in talks around a similar deal.\n\nThese talks have reportedly not been finalized and could still fall through. Meta declined to comment; Apple did not immediately respond.\n\nAs Sarah Perez noted, Apple\u2019s approach to AI currently sounds a bit boring and practical \u2014 rather than treating this as an opportunity for wholesale reinvention or disruption, it\u2019s starting out by adding AI-powered features (like writing suggestions and custom emojis) to its existing products. But emphasizing practicality over flashiness might be the key to AI adoption. Then Apple can leverage partnerships to go beyond the capabilities of its own AI models.\n\nSo a deal with Meta could make Apple less reliant on a single partner, while also providing validation for Meta\u2019s generative AI tech. The WSJ reports that Apple isn\u2019t offering to pay for these partnerships; instead, it provides distribution to AI partners who can then sell premium subscriptions.\n\nAnd while Elon Musk, who co-founded OpenAI but is now competing with it through his new startup xAI, seemed so concerned about the possibility that ChatGPT would be deeply integrated with Apple\u2019s operating systems that he threatened to ban Apple devices from his companies, Apple has said it will ask for users\u2019 permission before sharing any questions and data with ChatGPT.

{"title": "How 2 high school teens raised a $500K seed round for their API startup (yes, it\u2019s AI)", "text": "Just a few weeks ago, 18-year-old best friends Christopher Fitzgerald and Nicholas Van Landschoot graduated from high school.\n\nWhile most teens their age would be living it up in their last summer before college or the adult jobs that await them, Fitzgerald and Van Landschoot are hunkered down in a VC office in Denver, Colorado.\n\nThey\u2019re spending the summer working on their startup APIGen after they raised a $500,000 pre-seed investment from Varana Capital. Fitzgerald will head off to Duke in the fall and Van Landschoot will move near the university but is putting his college plans on hold to be a full-time startup founder.\n\nThe money was raised while they were still in high school after a prototype for their idea garnered a lot of interest among the large Boulder community of AI enthusiasts.\n\nAPIGen is working on a platform that will build custom APIs from natural language prompts. It will be able to, for instance, allow an e-commerce business to simply ask for an API that connects its web front end to its database, and the platform will deliver it.\n\nBy API, the founders don\u2019t just mean a standard \u201capplication programming interface\u201d that allows applications to exchange data or perform some other simple workflow function. They want APIGen to create complex custom APIs that can do multiple or serial tasks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually generating the code for the APIs so that you can have business logic, actual custom functionalities within those APIs as well,\u201d Van Landschoot told TechCrunch.\n\nIn addition to web apps and databases, Fitzgerald says IoT devices are one of his startup\u2019s target areas. He offers the example of a customer asking for an API that instructs a drone to fly around the perimeter of an area, capture images and allow another application to interface with the result. Another example is an API that uses face recognition for building security. Once a database of photos of verified employee faces is created, the user could ask APIGen for an API that lets a smartlock\u2019s door camera check the face of everyone who arrives against that database before unlocking the door.\n\n\u201cAPIs at the end of the day, can be as simple or as complex as you make them to be,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cThey can range from just new connectors that take one entry of data, one row of data from a table of a database, to entire back ends. And that\u2019s really what we\u2019re trying to target there, for entire web apps for entire IoT applications.\u201d\n\nThe teens met on their school\u2019s debate team and bonded over their love of coding. Their first project together was a chatbot that would allow people to chat with data. They soon realized that it wasn\u2019t an original idea. Still, while building that app, they learned that their tech relied on APIs and that \u201cmaking APIs was kind of a pain,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cThey were hard to design.\u201d\n\nSo they focused on that. Once they crafted an alpha version of their idea, a demo-level tool, they began to show it around to the programmers in their circle to get feedback. They knew people in their local tech industry. Van Landschoot\u2019s dad works in cybersecurity IT, and Fitzgerald landed a summer internship at SoftBank through a connection with a friend\u2019s dad.\n\nAnd then they started sending cold messages to VCs on LinkedIn and to anyone else they thought might respond.\n\n\u201cWe asked people to destroy this pitch deck,\u201d Fitzgerald said.\n\nPhil Broenniman (left), Ankur Ahuja (right), Varana Capital Image Credits: Varana Capital\n\nA VC is so impressed, he offers to invest\n\nOne of the people who got the message \u2014 and had heard about the founders through other connections in Denver/Boulder\u2019s tight-knit startup community \u2014 was Philip Broenniman, founder of Denver\u2019s Varana Capital. Varana began as a family office for Broenniman and a partner 13 years ago, and has since expanded into a firm with institutional LP money and $400 million in AUM, he told TechCrunch\n\nBroenniman and Varana COO Ankur Ahuja agreed to meet with the teens. \u201cWe went into the meeting thinking we were going to provide some fatherly, avuncular advice; provide some words of wisdom,\u201d Broenniman told TechCrunch. \u201cWe walked out after two hours of their presentation thinking that this was the best presentation we had heard in the last five years. We were blown away by the cogent insights these two 18-year-olds gave.\u201d\n\nWith Fitzgerald dressed in his best sweater and Van Landschoot in a debate-team-style collared shirt, they leaned into their debate training and pitched their company, their vision, the potential market and themselves.\n\nRather than feedback on the pitch, \u201cAt the end of the meeting, they mentioned that they were actually interested,\u201d Fitzgerald said of the Varana partners. Broenniman asked the teens how much money they were looking for.\n\nVarana did its diligence looking into the potential of the API market, which has created multibillion dollars\u2019 worth of successes (MuleSoft bought by Salesforce, Apigee bought by Google, to name just two). And it looked at the founders\u2019 backgrounds: Fitzgerald graduated as valedictorian of a top-ranked high school in Boulder, which has a highly ranked public education system; Van Landschoot was such a gifted programmer that he had been tutoring college computer science students since he was 14.\n\nThe Varana partners scheduled a second meeting for the founders to demo their tech to make sure the teens weren\u2019t just \u201cgood at talking but not delivering and doing stuff,\u201d as Van Landschoot described.\n\nThe teens were nervous, they confessed, but the demo went well and the VC offered a term sheet: $250,000 of pre-seed money with another $250,000 in a SAFE, which is a note that converts to equity if the startup raises later. The VC also provided office space.\n\nWhile they were pitching to the VCs, Fitzgerald learned about Boulder\u2019s active AI Meetup that has 1,400 members, organized by a dad of one of Fitzgerald\u2019s tennis team teammates. Boulder has a famously close and cozy startup community and, along with nearby Denver, hosts office outposts for Amazon, IBM, Google, Microsoft and many others.\n\nThe teens joined the group and demoed their product, and the local AI enthusiasts rallied behind them and their idea.\n\nAPIGen is obviously very early. And it isn\u2019t the only one working on automating APIs. Giant tech companies like Salesforce\u2019s MuleSoft and established startups like RapidAPI are already working on this market, as are most of the cloud giants.\n\nAPIGen also doesn\u2019t yet have its minimum viable product built, though it\u2019s getting closer with a beta version that will be released this month. \u201cWe\u2019ve already had some interest from businesses, but obviously we\u2019re still pre-MVP at this stage, and just cranking, trying to get it out as soon as possible,\u201d Fitzgerald said.\n\nStill, Broenniman, who takes board seats with investments, is in for the ride. He points to how the young founders have already built a community of eager supporters.\n\n\u201cAPIGen may be the vehicle into which we\u2019re making an investment, but we\u2019re creating partnership with Christopher and Nicholas,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a $7 billion-plus market. They are entering with some elements of competition there but are carving out their own space.

She\u2019s also an AI expert consultant at the African Union High Level Panel on Emerging Technologies and works on the AU-AI continental Strategy titled \u201cHarnessing Artificial Intelligence for Africa\u2019s Socio-Economic Development\u201d with a focus on shaping the AI governance landscape in Africa.\n\nN\u2019Guessan has also co-authored several publications and is the first woman recipient of the Africa Prize for Engineering Innovation awarded by the Royal Academy of Engineering.\n\nBriefly, how did you get your start in AI? What attracted you to the field?\n\nI have an engineering background from a formal and informal education. I have always been passionate about the use of technology to build solutions that would positively impact my communities. This ambition led me to relocate to Ghana in 2017, where I aimed to learn from the anglophone market and kickstart my tech entrepreneurial journey.\n\nIn the development process of my startup, my former co-founders and I conducted market research to identify challenges in the financial sector, resulting in online identity fraud. We then decided to build a secure, reliable, and effective solution for financial institutions to bridge the gap in serving the unbanked populations in remote areas and establish online trust. This led to a software solution leveraging facial recognition and AI technologies, tailored to facilitate organizations in processing online client ID verification while ensuring our model was trained with representative data from the African market. This marked my initial involvement in the AI industry. Note that in 2023, despite our efforts, we encountered various challenges that led us to stop commercializing our product on the market. However, this experience fueled my determination to continue working in the AI field.\n\nWhat attracted me to AI was the realization of its immense power as a tool for solving societal problems. Once you grasp the technology, you can see its potential to address a wide range of issues. This understanding fueled my passion for AI and continues to drive my work in the field today.\n\nWhat work are you most proud of in the AI field?\n\nI am incredibly proud of my journey as a deep tech entrepreneur. Building an AI-driven startup in Africa isn\u2019t easy, so for those who have embarked on this journey, it\u2019s a significant achievement. This experience has been a major milestone in my professional career, and I am grateful for the challenges and opportunities it has brought.\n\nCurrently, I am proud of the work we do at Amini, where we are tackling the challenge of data scarcity on the African continent. Having faced this issue as a former founder myself, I am very grateful to work with inspiring and talented problem solvers. Today, my team and I have developed a solution by building a data infrastructure using space technology and AI to make data accessible and comprehensible. Our work is a game-changer and a crucial starting point for more data-driven products to emerge in the African market.\n\nHow do you navigate the challenges of the male-dominated tech industry and, by extension, the male-dominated AI industry?\n\nTruth is, what we are facing today in the industry has been shaped by societal biases and gender stereotypes. This is a societal mindset that has been nurtured for years. Most of the women working in the AI industry have been told at least once that they were in the wrong industry because they were expected to be A, B, C and D.\n\nWhy should we have to choose? Why should society dictate our paths for us? It\u2019s important to remind ourselves that women have made remarkable contributions to science, leading to some of the most impactful technological advancements that society is benefiting today. They exemplify what women can achieve when provided with education and resources.\n\nI am aware that it takes time to change a mindset, but we can\u2019t wait; we need to continue encouraging girls to study science and embrace careers in AI. Honestly, I\u2019ve seen progress compared to previous years, which gives me hope. I believe that ensuring equal opportunities in the industry will attract more women to AI roles, and providing more access to leadership positions for women will accelerate change toward gender balance in male-dominated industries.\n\nWhat advice would you give to women seeking to enter the AI field?\n\nFocus on your learning and ensure you acquire the skills needed in the AI field. Understand that the industry may expect you to demonstrate your capabilities more intensely compared to your male fellows. Honestly, investing in your skills is crucial and serves as a solid foundation. I believe this will not only boost your confidence in seizing opportunities but also enhance your resilience and professional growth.\n\nWhat are some of the most pressing issues facing AI as it evolves?\n\nSome of the most pressing issues facing AI as it evolves include challenges in articulating its short-term and long-term impacts on humans. This is currently a global conversation due to uncertainty surrounding emerging technologies. While we have witnessed impressive applications of AI in industries globally, including in Africa, particularly with the recent advancements in generative AI solutions and the capability of AI models to process vast volumes of data with minimal latency, we have also observed AI models riddled with various biases and hallucinations. The world is undeniably moving toward a more AI-driven future. However, several questions remain unanswered and need to be addressed:\n\nWhat is the future of humans in the AI loop?\n\nWhat is the appropriate approach for regulators to define policies and laws to mitigate risks in AI models?\n\nWhat does AI responsibility and ethical framework mean?\n\nWho should be held accountable for the outcomes of AI models?\n\nWhat are some issues AI users should be aware of?\n\nI like to remind people that we are all first AI users before any other title. Each of us interacts with AI solutions in various ways, whether it\u2019s directly or through our people (such as family members, friends, etc.) using various devices. That\u2019s why it is important to have an understanding of the technology itself. One of the things you should know is that most AI solutions on the market require your data, and as a user, be curious to understand the extent of control you give the machine over your data. When considering consuming an AI solution, consider data privacy and the security offered by the platform. This is crucial for your protection.\n\nAdditionally, there has been a lot of excitement about generative AI content. However, it\u2019s essential to be cautious about what you generate with these tools and to discern between content that is real and that which is false. For instance, social media users have faced the spread of deepfake-generated content, which serves as an example of how people with malicious intentions can misuse these tools. Always verify the source of generated content before sharing it, to avoid contributing to the problem.\n\nLastly, AI users should be mindful of becoming overly dependent on these tools. Some individuals may become addicted, and we\u2019ve seen instances where users have taken negative actions based on recommendations from AI chats. It\u2019s important to remember that AI models can produce inaccurate outcomes due to societal biases or other factors. In the long-term, users should strive to maintain independence to prevent potential mental health issues arising from unethical AI tools.\n\nWhat is the best way to responsibility build AI?\n\nThis is an interesting topic. I have been working with the High Panel on Emerging Technologies of the African Union as an AI expert consultant, focusing on drafting the AU-AI continental strategy with stakeholders from various backgrounds and countries involved. The goal of this strategy is to guide AU member states to recognize the value of AI for economic growth and develop a framework that supports the development of AI solutions while protecting Africans. Some key principles I always advise considering when building responsible AI for the African market are as follows:\n\nContext matters : Ensure your models are diverse and inclusive to address societal discrimination based on gender, regions, race, age, etc.\n\n: Ensure your models are diverse and inclusive to address societal discrimination based on gender, regions, race, age, etc. Accessibility : Is your solution accessible by your users?

However, one of the challenges is that many investors may lack knowledge and understanding about AI technology. What I have learned is that AI-driven products don\u2019t undergo the same investment risk assessment as other technological products on the market.\n\nTo address this challenge, investors should look beyond trends and deeply evaluate the solution at both the technical and impact levels.

{"title": "\u2018What\u2019s in it for us?\u2019 journalists ask as publications sign content deals with AI firms", "text": "Now writers are picking up the pace to put AI protections in contracts\n\nVox Media\u2019s president, Pam Wasserstein, sent her staff a Slack message and an email on May 29 detailing what the company\u2019s journalists say was shocking news: Vox had signed a content licensing deal with OpenAI.\n\nThe deal gives the AI company access to Vox\u2019s current content, as well as the entire archive of its journalistic work, to train ChatGPT and other models. Wasserstein sent the alerts just moments before Axios published an exclusive detailing the licensing and product deal, much to the surprise of her journalists.\n\nWriters at The Atlantic, which signed a similar deal with the Microsoft-backed AI giant, were also sent an email moments before the Axios piece went up.\n\n\u201cAtlantic staffers have largely learned of this agreement from outside sources, and both the company and OpenAI have refused to answer questions about the terms of the deal,\u201d reads a May 30 statement from The Atlantic Union.\n\nNone of the current or former journalists at either company who TechCrunch interviewed had any inkling that their work would be handed over to OpenAI. All of them are concerned that their employers are making short-sighted deals that will ultimately harm writers and journalism as a whole.\n\nBoth Vox Media \u2014 which includes The Verge, New York, Eater, The Cut and more publications \u2014 and The Atlantic have published pieces that are critical of OpenAI and generative AI. They have aired concerns about the environmental impact of the power needed to run large language models, the board upheavals at OpenAI, and the \u201cgeneral lack of trustworthiness\u201d in the company, said Amy McCarthy, a reporter at Eater and communications chair of Vox\u2019s union.\n\nVox did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSince the deals were announced, journalists at each publisher have wrangled meetings with business-side higher-ups to learn more about the agreements, looking for one crucial piece of information: What\u2019s in it for the journalists?\n\nA sense of urgency\n\nIn the face of an increasing number of AI media deals, news guilds are now notching up the pace of negotiations to put in place AI protections similar to the ones Hollywood writing teams fought for.\n\n\u201cThe Writers Guild and Vox Media Union are firmly of the opinion that implementation of AI is a mandatory subject of bargaining, even though our contracts may not explicitly have AI provisions,\u201d McCarthy told TechCrunch. \u201cWe do have provisions in our contract that essentially mean that the company has to bargain with us over fundamental changes to our working conditions, and we very much believe this is a workplace issue, that it\u2019s a working conditions issue, and that the company is obligated to bargain with us about how this will work.\u201d\n\nThis means publishers that strike deals with AI providers might be contractually required to engage in discussions and negotiations with unions about these changes.\n\nThe Atlantic Media Union had also intended to bring this issue to the bargaining table, but the OpenAI deal adds a sense of urgency, one current employee told TechCrunch, requesting anonymity.\n\nDuring negotiations this month, The Atlantic\u2019s union put forward a proposal, per which AI wouldn\u2019t be used to replace writing, fact-checking, copy editing and illustration. It also proposed that writers can use AI at their discretion, in accordance with journalistic principles and ethics, but they can\u2019t be made to use it. That proposal is yet to be accepted.\n\nOther unions are working to put in similar protections. Nebraska journalists at the Omaha World-Herald Guild secured protections from AI earlier this year. In 2023, after CNET published a series of AI-generated articles, journalists at the publication went public with their union drive, demanding AI protections and a say in how AI is implemented in employee workflows.\n\nMaking companies include such safeguards in journalists\u2019 contracts is vital, because protection from the law isn\u2019t guaranteed. Companies like OpenAI contend that they\u2019re not breaking copyright laws by scraping what they say is publicly available content. They also say their chatbots don\u2019t reproduce the material in its entirety.\n\nBut publications like The New York Times, Raw Story, AlterNet and The Intercept have all sued OpenAI for using copyrighted works by journalists to train ChatGPT without properly crediting or citing the sources. Novelists, computer programmers and other groups have also filed copyright suits against OpenAI and other companies building generative AI.\n\nRichard Tofel, former president of nonprofit newsroom ProPublica and a consultant to news outlets, thinks these lawsuits will end up in the Supreme Court. If the courts rule that OpenAI and others are guilty of copyright infringement, \u201cthey\u2019ll need to make a deal with everybody.\u201d\n\nTofel thinks most publishers will end up making deals with AI companies. He noted that Google also faced similar copyright suits back when its search product was taking off, but by the time those were settled, users were so dependent on search that no publisher wanted to keep its content out of it.\n\nMcCarthy says writers can\u2019t rely only on the courts: \u201cWe have to look at every potential avenue as a way to push back against AI implementation.\u201d\n\nAnother concern for journalists is the adoption of AI by publishers for writing content, which some media outlets have already begun experimenting with.\n\nCNET and Gannett have published AI-generated stories and art, and in the case of Sports Illustrated, under fabricated bylines. Those stories were called out as AI-generated mainly because they were riddled with factual errors, but if AI gets a free pass to train on good journalism, those obvious errors may decrease over time.\n\nIf journalists won\u2019t question this, who will?\n\nJournalists understand the basic structure of the deals, but they still have questions.\n\nThe Atlantic\u2019s VP of communications, Anna Bross, said the company\u2019s partnership positions it as a premium news source within OpenAI, similar to other publishers\u2019 deals.\n\n\u201cThe Atlantic\u2019s articles will be discoverable within OpenAI\u2019s products, including ChatGPT, and as a partner, The Atlantic will help to shape how news is surfaced and presented in future real-time discovery products,\u201d Bross told TechCrunch. \u201cThe deal ensures guardrails and protections around how our content does appear within OpenAI\u2019s products. \u2026 If an Atlantic article is surfaced in response to a query, there will be Atlantic branding and a link back to the article on our site.\u201d\n\nBross noted that this is not a syndication license, meaning that OpenAI doesn\u2019t have permission to reproduce The Atlantic\u2019s articles or create similar reproductions of whole articles or lengthy excerpts.\n\nHowever, Atlantic journalists are still waiting on their leadership to explain why such content doesn\u2019t qualify as derivative work, which they would have the chance of being paid directly for. The Atlantic recently launched a new line of paperback books with the collected works of its writers, and it compensated the writers for those works, multiple sources told TechCrunch.\n\nBross noted that The Atlantic\u2019s contract with OpenAI protects against the creation of a derivative work.\n\nThe Atlantic\u2019s editorial staff brought up that topic at an all-hands meeting in mid-June, headed by the publication\u2019s CEO Nick Thompson, and they learned that while ChatGPT will be getting access to their work, the edit team is otherwise \u201cfairly insulated from it.\u201d\n\nIn other words, there\u2019s not an immediate threat of ChatGPT being used to write articles.\n\nThe financial terms of The Atlantic and Vox deals still elude journalists inside and outside the publications, but we know that The Atlantic\u2019s is a two-year contract, and that both will include the use of OpenAI technology for building products and features. OpenAI says that its tech will not be used to mimic writers\u2019 own voices.\n\nNews Corp, The Wall Street Journal\u2019s parent company, has also signed a deal with OpenAI that\u2019s reportedly worth more than $250 million over five years.

{"title": "\u2018What\u2019s in it for us?\u2019 journalists ask as publications sign content deals with AI firms", "text": "Now writers are picking up the pace to put AI protections in contracts\n\nVox Media\u2019s president, Pam Wasserstein, sent her staff a Slack message and an email on May 29 detailing what the company\u2019s journalists say was shocking news: Vox had signed a content licensing deal with OpenAI.\n\nThe deal gives the AI company access to Vox\u2019s current content, as well as the entire archive of its journalistic work, to train ChatGPT and other models. Wasserstein sent the alerts just moments before Axios published an exclusive detailing the licensing and product deal, much to the surprise of her journalists.\n\nWriters at The Atlantic, which signed a similar deal with the Microsoft-backed AI giant, were also sent an email moments before the Axios piece went up.\n\n\u201cAtlantic staffers have largely learned of this agreement from outside sources, and both the company and OpenAI have refused to answer questions about the terms of the deal,\u201d reads a May 30 statement from The Atlantic Union.\n\nNone of the current or former journalists at either company who TechCrunch interviewed had any inkling that their work would be handed over to OpenAI. All of them are concerned that their employers are making short-sighted deals that will ultimately harm writers and journalism as a whole.\n\nBoth Vox Media \u2014 which includes The Verge, New York, Eater, The Cut and more publications \u2014 and The Atlantic have published pieces that are critical of OpenAI and generative AI. They have aired concerns about the environmental impact of the power needed to run large language models, the board upheavals at OpenAI, and the \u201cgeneral lack of trustworthiness\u201d in the company, said Amy McCarthy, a reporter at Eater and communications chair of Vox\u2019s union.\n\nVox did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSince the deals were announced, journalists at each publisher have wrangled meetings with business-side higher-ups to learn more about the agreements, looking for one crucial piece of information: What\u2019s in it for the journalists?\n\nA sense of urgency\n\nIn the face of an increasing number of AI media deals, news guilds are now notching up the pace of negotiations to put in place AI protections similar to the ones Hollywood writing teams fought for.\n\n\u201cThe Writers Guild and Vox Media Union are firmly of the opinion that implementation of AI is a mandatory subject of bargaining, even though our contracts may not explicitly have AI provisions,\u201d McCarthy told TechCrunch. \u201cWe do have provisions in our contract that essentially mean that the company has to bargain with us over fundamental changes to our working conditions, and we very much believe this is a workplace issue, that it\u2019s a working conditions issue, and that the company is obligated to bargain with us about how this will work.\u201d\n\nThis means publishers that strike deals with AI providers might be contractually required to engage in discussions and negotiations with unions about these changes.\n\nThe Atlantic Media Union had also intended to bring this issue to the bargaining table, but the OpenAI deal adds a sense of urgency, one current employee told TechCrunch, requesting anonymity.\n\nDuring negotiations this month, The Atlantic\u2019s union put forward a proposal, per which AI wouldn\u2019t be used to replace writing, fact-checking, copy editing and illustration. It also proposed that writers can use AI at their discretion, in accordance with journalistic principles and ethics, but they can\u2019t be made to use it. That proposal is yet to be accepted.\n\nOther unions are working to put in similar protections. Nebraska journalists at the Omaha World-Herald Guild secured protections from AI earlier this year. In 2023, after CNET published a series of AI-generated articles, journalists at the publication went public with their union drive, demanding AI protections and a say in how AI is implemented in employee workflows.\n\nMaking companies include such safeguards in journalists\u2019 contracts is vital, because protection from the law isn\u2019t guaranteed. Companies like OpenAI contend that they\u2019re not breaking copyright laws by scraping what they say is publicly available content. They also say their chatbots don\u2019t reproduce the material in its entirety.\n\nBut publications like The New York Times, Raw Story, AlterNet and The Intercept have all sued OpenAI for using copyrighted works by journalists to train ChatGPT without properly crediting or citing the sources. Novelists, computer programmers and other groups have also filed copyright suits against OpenAI and other companies building generative AI.\n\nRichard Tofel, former president of nonprofit newsroom ProPublica and a consultant to news outlets, thinks these lawsuits will end up in the Supreme Court. If the courts rule that OpenAI and others are guilty of copyright infringement, \u201cthey\u2019ll need to make a deal with everybody.\u201d\n\nTofel thinks most publishers will end up making deals with AI companies. He noted that Google also faced similar copyright suits back when its search product was taking off, but by the time those were settled, users were so dependent on search that no publisher wanted to keep its content out of it.\n\nMcCarthy says writers can\u2019t rely only on the courts: \u201cWe have to look at every potential avenue as a way to push back against AI implementation.\u201d\n\nAnother concern for journalists is the adoption of AI by publishers for writing content, which some media outlets have already begun experimenting with.\n\nCNET and Gannett have published AI-generated stories and art, and in the case of Sports Illustrated, under fabricated bylines. Those stories were called out as AI-generated mainly because they were riddled with factual errors, but if AI gets a free pass to train on good journalism, those obvious errors may decrease over time.\n\nIf journalists won\u2019t question this, who will?\n\nJournalists understand the basic structure of the deals, but they still have questions.\n\nThe Atlantic\u2019s VP of communications, Anna Bross, said the company\u2019s partnership positions it as a premium news source within OpenAI, similar to other publishers\u2019 deals.\n\n\u201cThe Atlantic\u2019s articles will be discoverable within OpenAI\u2019s products, including ChatGPT, and as a partner, The Atlantic will help to shape how news is surfaced and presented in future real-time discovery products,\u201d Bross told TechCrunch. \u201cThe deal ensures guardrails and protections around how our content does appear within OpenAI\u2019s products. \u2026 If an Atlantic article is surfaced in response to a query, there will be Atlantic branding and a link back to the article on our site.\u201d\n\nBross noted that this is not a syndication license, meaning that OpenAI doesn\u2019t have permission to reproduce The Atlantic\u2019s articles or create similar reproductions of whole articles or lengthy excerpts.\n\nHowever, Atlantic journalists are still waiting on their leadership to explain why such content doesn\u2019t qualify as derivative work, which they would have the chance of being paid directly for. The Atlantic recently launched a new line of paperback books with the collected works of its writers, and it compensated the writers for those works, multiple sources told TechCrunch.\n\nBross noted that The Atlantic\u2019s contract with OpenAI protects against the creation of a derivative work.\n\nThe Atlantic\u2019s editorial staff brought up that topic at an all-hands meeting in mid-June, headed by the publication\u2019s CEO Nick Thompson, and they learned that while ChatGPT will be getting access to their work, the edit team is otherwise \u201cfairly insulated from it.\u201d\n\nIn other words, there\u2019s not an immediate threat of ChatGPT being used to write articles.\n\nThe financial terms of The Atlantic and Vox deals still elude journalists inside and outside the publications, but we know that The Atlantic\u2019s is a two-year contract, and that both will include the use of OpenAI technology for building products and features. OpenAI says that its tech will not be used to mimic writers\u2019 own voices.\n\nNews Corp, The Wall Street Journal\u2019s parent company, has also signed a deal with OpenAI that\u2019s reportedly worth more than $250 million over five years. Axel Springer, which runs Politico and Business Insider, has also joined hands with OpenAI in a deal reportedly worth tens of millions of euros.\n\nOther media outlets that have already signed similar partnerships with OpenAI include Dotdash Meredith (publisher of People, Better Homes & Gardens, Allrecipes, Investopedia and more), The Associated Press, The Financial Times, Le Monde in France, and Prisa Media in Spain.\n\n(We should also note that TechCrunch\u2019s parent company, Yahoo, is also dabbling with AI via the Yahoo News app. It\u2019s powered by the underlying code of the app Artifact, which Yahoo acquired in April.)\n\nOpenAI claims its agreements will help journalists by driving traffic back to their articles, but that remains to be seen as the implementations aren\u2019t yet live.\n\nTofel said that if users can ask an AI chatbot for the latest on the Israel-Hamas war, for example, it would present \u201cthe ultimate nightmare for the news companies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey could be very significantly disintermediated by an AI news product,\u201d he said.\n\nOpenAI was not able to confirm specifics about the user experience design, which could determine how likely a reader is to click an external link to an article.\n\nAnd if readers don\u2019t have to go to a publisher\u2019s website to read articles, its ad revenue will suffer \u2014 that\u2019s something the news industry is already struggling with as Google and Meta have deprioritized news in their algorithms. Journalists and writers will have a smaller audience for their work as well.\n\nJournalism is suffering from a lack of funding, mostly because tech giants like Meta and Google today rake in the lion\u2019s share of digital ad revenue. Publishers will no doubt welcome a new revenue stream to augment their balance sheets.\n\nBut journalists are questioning whether this is the best way forward.\n\n\u201cIt feels very much like a protection racket,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cLike we made a deal with the guy who just robbed our house, and he\u2019s pinky promising that he won\u2019t rob the house.\u201d\n\nSome AI startups are already lifting content without striking any deals.

{"title": "Apple\u2019s App Store breaches EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act", "text": "A few months after opening a non-compliance case on Apple and the Digital Markets Act (DMA), the European Commission has shared its preliminary findings with Apple. And the bottom line is that the current App Store rules are in breach of the DMA. Confirmed violations of the DMA can lead to fines of up to 10% of global annual turnover.\n\n\u201c\u2018Act different\u2019 should be their new slogan,\u201d the EU\u2019s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, wrote on X. \u201cFor too long, Apple has been squeezing out innovative companies \u2014 denying consumers new opportunities & choices.\u201d\n\nIn this particular case, the European Commission believes third-party developers should be able to inform customers of alternative purchasing possibilities \u2014 free of charge.\n\nFor instance, developers who have released apps on the App Store can\u2019t advertise different prices or alternative distribution channels in their apps. While Apple now allows developers to include a link to their site, the European Commission believes there are too many restrictions with this link-out mechanism.\n\nEven if developers redirect users to their websites and handle transactions on their websites, they have to report transactions to Apple and pay a commission. Apple only waives a 3% payment processing fee for web purchases.\n\n\u201cApple has made a number of changes to comply with the DMA in response to feedback from developers and the European Commission,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe are confident our plan complies with the law, and estimate more than 99% of developers would pay the same or less in fees to Apple under the new business terms we created.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these preliminary findings, the European Commission is opening a third non-compliance investigation into Apple\u2019s new contractual terms for EU developers. This time, the Commission is going to focus on Apple\u2019s controversial Core Technology Fee (CTF) and alternative app marketplaces.\n\nEuropean developers can remain on the standard business terms or choose new business terms that allow them to distribute their apps outside of the App Store. However, these new terms lead to a \u20ac0.50 fee per installed app after one million downloads.\n\nThe company has already adjusted the CTF so that it doesn\u2019t apply to free non-commercial apps. There\u2019s also a three-year transition period for small developers that release a hit app and get more than one million downloads for the first time. But that doesn\u2019t change much in the long term. With this new formal investigation, the EC will determine whether the CTF effectively complies with the DMA.\n\nIf you\u2019ve tried to install a third-party app store in the EU, such as the AltStore, Setapp Mobile or Aptoide, you may have noticed that it requires quite a few taps. You first get an error in your web browser. You have to open the Settings app, accept app installations from this site, go back to your web browser, download the alternative store again, and accept popups about the risks involved with a third-party app store. The EC will examine this \u201cmulti-step user journey\u201d and its compliance with the DMA rules.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that Apple designed its new business model to discourage app developers and end users from taking advantage of the opportunities afforded to them by the DMA,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, the Commission EVP in charge of competition policy, said in a speech.\n\n\u201cThe letter of the DMA is clear: Gatekeepers have to allow for alternative app stores to establish themselves on their platform, and for consumers to be fully informed about the offers available to them so that they can freely choose where they want to source their apps, and at what conditions,\u201d she added.\n\nAs for today\u2019s preliminary findings, Apple can now respond to the European Commission in writing. The final decision is due one year after the opening of the formal investigation, which means that Apple can negotiate with the EU and adjust its business terms once again to avoid a hefty fine.", "authors": "['Romain Dillet']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2112138706.jpg?resize=1200,795", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/24/apples-app-store-breaches-eus-digital-markets-act/", "timestamp": "1719366344.221361", "displayed": 0}
{"title": "Silicon Valley leaders are once again declaring \u2018DEI\u2019 bad and \u2018meritocracy\u2019 good \u2014 but they\u2019re wrong", "text": "No, Silicon Valley, a \u2018meritocracy\u2019 is not better than DEI, according to the data\n\nWho\u2019s afraid of the Big Bad DEI? The acronym is near-poisonous now \u2014 a word that creates almost instant tension between those who embrace it and those who want it dead.\n\nA prime example of this divide was the response to startup Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang\u2019s post on X last week. He wrote about moving away from DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) to instead embrace \u201cMEI\u201d \u2014 merit, excellence, and intelligence.\n\n\u201cScale is a meritocracy, and we must always remain one,\u201d Wang wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal whenever we invite someone to join our mission, and those decisions have never been swayed by orthodoxy or virtue signaling or whatever the current thing is.\u201d\n\nToday we\u2019ve formalized an important hiring policy at Scale. We hire for MEI: merit, excellence, and intelligence.\n\n\n\nThis is the email I\u2019ve shared with our @scale_AI team.\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\nMERITOCRACY AT SCALE\n\n\n\nIn the wake of our fundraise, I\u2019ve been getting a lot of questions\u2026 \u2014 Alexandr Wang (@alexandr_wang) June 13, 2024\n\nThe commenters on X \u2014 which included Elon Musk, Palmer Luckey, and Brian Armstrong \u2014 were thrilled. On LinkedIn, however, the startup community gave a less-than-enthusiastic response. Those commenters pointed out that Wang\u2019s post made it seem as if \u201cmeritocracy\u201d was the definitive benchmark to find qualified hiring candidates \u2014 without taking into consideration that the idea of meritocracy is itself subjective. In the days that have followed the post, more and more people have shared their thoughts and what Wang\u2019s comments reveal about the current state of DEI in tech.\n\n\u201cThe post is misguided because people who support the meritocracy argument are ignoring the structural reasons some groups are more likely to outperform others,\u201d Mutale Nkonde, a founder working in AI policy, told TechCrunch. \u201dWe all want the best people for the job, and there is data to prove that diverse teams are more effective.\u201d\n\nEmily Witko, an HR professional at AI startup Hugging Face, told TechCrunch that the post was a \u201cdangerous oversimplification,\u201d but that it received so much attention on X because it \u201copenly expressed sentiments that are not always expressed publicly and the audience there is hungry to attack DEI.\u201d Wang\u2019s MEI thought \u201cmakes it so easy to refute or criticize any conversations regarding the importance of acknowledging underrepresentation in tech,\u201d she continued.\n\nBut Wang is far from the only Silicon Valley insider to attack DEI in recent months. He joins a chorus of those who feel that DEI programs implemented at businesses over the past several years, peaking with the Black Lives Matter movement, caused a backslide in corporate profitability \u2014 and that a return to \u201cmeritocratic principles\u201d is overdue. Indeed, much of the tech industry has worked to dismantle recruitment programs that considered candidates who, under previous hiring regimes, were often overlooked in the hiring process.\n\nSeeking to make a change, in 2020, many organizations and power players came together to promise more of a focus on DEI, which, contrary to the mainstream discussion, is not simply about hiring someone based on the color of their skin but is about ensuring qualified people from all walks of life \u2014 regardless of skin, gender, or ethnic background \u2014 are better represented and included in recruitment funnels. It\u2019s also about taking a look at disparities and pipeline issues, analyzing the reasoning behind why certain candidates are constantly overlooked in a hiring process.\n\nIn 2023, the U.S. data industry saw new women recruit levels drop by two-thirds, from 36% in 2022 to just 12%, according to a report from HR staffing firm Harnham. Meanwhile, the percentage of Black, Indigenous, and professionals of color in VP or above data roles stood at just 38% in 2022.\n\nAlexandr Wang (pictured above) caused a stir on social media when he posted about meritocracy in tech on X. Image Credits: Drew Angerer / Staff / Getty Images\n\nDEI-related job listings have also fallen out of favor, declining 44% in 2023, according to data from the job site Indeed. In the AI industry, a recent Deloitte survey of women found that over half said they ended up leaving at least one employer because of how men and women were treated differently, while 73% considered leaving the tech industry altogether due to unequal pay and an inability to advance in their careers.\n\nYet, for an industry that prides itself on being data-driven, Silicon Valley cannot let the idea of a meritocracy go \u2014 despite all the data and research showing how such thinking is just a belief system and one that can lead to biased outcomes. The idea of going out and hiring \u201cthe best person for the job\u201d without taking into account any human sociology is how pattern-matching occurs \u2014 teams and companies of people who are alike, when the research has long shown that more diverse teams perform better. Moreover, it has only raised suspicions about who the Valley considers excellent and why.\n\nExperts we spoke to said this subjectiveness revealed other issues with Wang\u2019s missive \u2014 mostly that he presents MEI as a revolutionary idea and not one that Silicon Valley and most of corporate America have long embraced. The acronym \u201cMEI\u201d appears to be a scornful nod to DEI, intended to drive home the notion that a company must choose between hiring diverse candidates or candidates that meet certain \u201cobjective\u201d qualifications.\n\nNatalie Sue Johnson, co-founder of the DEI consulting firm Paradigm, told TechCrunch that research has shown meritocracy to be a paradox and that organizations that focus too much on it actually see an increase in bias. \u201cIt frees people up from thinking that they have to try hard to be fair in their decision-making,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey think that meritocracy is inherent, not something that needs to be achieved.\u201d\n\nAs Nkonde mentioned, Johnson noted that Wang\u2019s approach doesn\u2019t acknowledge that underrepresented groups face systemic barriers society is still struggling to address. Ironically, the most meritorious person could be the one who has achieved a skill set for a job despite such barriers that may have influenced their educational background or prevented them from filling their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with the kind of college internships that impresses Silicon Valley.\n\nTreating a person as a faceless, nameless candidate, without understanding their unique experiences, and therefore their employability, is a mistake, Johnson said. \u201cThere is nuance.\u201d\n\nWitko added to that: \u201cA meritocratic system is built on criteria that reflect the status quo, and therefore, it will perpetuate existing inequalities by continuously favoring those who already have advantages.\u201d\n\nTo be somewhat charitable to Wang, given how acidic the term DEI has become, developing a new term that still represents the value of fairness to all candidates, isn\u2019t a terrible idea \u2014 even if \u201cmeritocracy\u201d is misguided. And his post suggests that Scale AI\u2019s values could align with the spirit of diversity, equity, and inclusion even if he might not realize it, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cCasting a wide net for talent and making objective hiring decisions that do not disadvantage candidates based on identity is exactly what diversity, equity, and inclusion work seeks to do,\u201d she explained.\n\nBut again, where Wang undermines this is endorsing the mistaken belief that meritocracy will produce outcomes based on one\u2019s abilities and merits alone.\n\nPerhaps it is all a paradox. If one looks at Scale AI\u2019s treatment of its data annotators \u2014 many of whom live in economically depressed countries and scrape by on little pay \u2014 it suggests the company has scant real interest in disrupting the status quo.\n\nScale AI\u2019s annotators work on tasks for multiple eight-hour workdays \u2014 no breaks \u2014 for pay ranging as low as $10 (per the Verge and NY Mag). It\u2019s on the backs of these annotators that Scale AI has built a business worth over $13 billion and with more than $1.6 billion in cash in the bank.\n\nWhen asked for comment on the allegations made in the Verge and NY Mag piece, a spokesperson pointed to this blog post, in which it described its human annotator jobs as \u201cgig work.\u201d The spokesperson didn\u2019t address TechCrunch\u2019s request for clarification on Scale AI\u2019s MEI policy.\n\nJohnson said Wang\u2019s post is a great example of the box many leaders and companies find themselves trapped in.\n\nShe pondered, can they trust that having meritocratic ideals is enough to lead to truly meritocratic outcomes, and promote diversity?\n\n\u201cOr,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cdo they acknowledge that ideals are not enough, and to truly build more diverse workforces where everyone has the same access to opportunities and can do their best work requires intention?\u201d", "authors": "['Dominic-Madori Davis', 'Kyle Wiggers']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DEI-big-bad-wolf.jpg?resize=1200,645", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/23/silicon-valley-leaders-are-once-again-declaring-dei-bad-and-meritocracy-good-but-theyre-wrong/", "timestamp": "1719366346.544696", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "iOS 18 could \u2018sherlock\u2019 $400M in app revenue", "text": "Apple\u2019s practice of leveraging ideas from its third-party developer community to become new iOS and Mac features and apps has a hefty price tag, a new report indicates. With the release of iOS 18 later this fall, Apple\u2019s changes may affect apps that today have an estimated $393 million in revenue and have been downloaded roughly 58 million times over the past year, according to an analysis by app intelligence firm Appfigures.\n\nEvery June at Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference, the iPhone maker teases the upcoming releases of its software and operating systems, which often include features previously only available through third-party apps. The practice is so common now it\u2019s even been given a name: \u201csherlocking\u201d \u2014 a reference to a 1990s search app for Mac that borrowed features from a third-party app known as Watson. Now when Apple launches a new feature that was before the domain of a third-party app, it\u2019s said to have \u201csherlocked\u201d the app.\n\nIn earlier years, sherlocking apps made some sense. After all, did the iPhone\u2019s flashlight really need to be a third-party offering, or would it be better as a built-in function? Plus, Apple has been able to launch features that made its software better adapted to consumers\u2019 wants and needs by looking at what\u2019s popular among the third-party developer community.\n\nOf course, this practice also raises the question as to whether Apple is leveraging proprietary data to make its determinations about what to build next, and whether the apps it competes with are being offered an even playing field. For example, before Apple launched its own parental controls system, it shut down many third-party apps that had built businesses in this space by saying their solutions were now noncompliant with its rules and policies. The apps weren\u2019t offered access to a developer API for managing Apple\u2019s built-in parental controls for years, prompting an antitrust investigation.\n\nIn more recent years, Apple has \u201csherlocked\u201d third parties with launches of features like Continuity Camera, medication tracking, sleep tracking and mood tracking, as well as apps like Freeform and Journal. This year, it turned its attention to password managers, call recording and transcription apps, those for making custom emoji, AI-powered writing tools and math helpers, trail apps and more.\n\nIn an analysis of third-party apps that generated more than 1,000 downloads per year, Appfigures discovered several genres that had found themselves in Apple\u2019s crosshairs in 2024.\n\nIn terms of worldwide gross revenue, these categories have generated significant income over the past 12 months, with the trail app category making the most at $307 million per year, led by market leader and 2023 Apple \u201cApp of the Year\u201d AllTrails. Grammar helper apps, like Grammarly and others, also generated $35.7 million, while math helpers and password managers earned $23.4 million and $20.3 million, respectively. Apps for making custom emoji generated $7 million, too.\n\nImage Credits: Appfigures\n\nOf these, trail apps accounted for the vast majority of \u201cpotentially sherlocked\u201d revenue, or 78%, noted Appfigures, as well as 40% of downloads of sherlocked apps. In May 2024, they accounted for an estimated $28.8 million in gross consumer spending and 2.5 million downloads, to give you an idea of scale.\n\nMany of these app categories were growing quickly, with math solvers having seen revenue growth of 43% year-over-year followed by grammar helpers (+40%), password managers (+38%) and trail apps (+28%). Emoji-making apps, however, were seeing declines at -17% year-over-year.\n\nImage Credits: Appfigures\n\nBy downloads, grammar helpers had seen 9.4 million installs over the past 12 months, followed by emoji makers (10.6 million), math-solving apps (9.5 million) and password managers (457,000 installs).\n\nAlthough these apps certainly have dedicated user bases that may not immediately choose to switch to a first-party offering, Apple\u2019s ability to offer similar functionality built-in could be detrimental to their potential growth. Casual users may be satisfied by Apple\u2019s \u201cgood enough\u201d solutions and won\u2019t seek out alternatives.\n\nHowever, apps that continue to develop new features and add enhancements beyond what Apple includes while also taking advantage of other new ways to reach users, like through Apple\u2019s improved Siri, may have a better shot than others.", "authors": "['Sarah Perez']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/app-store-2024-v1.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/18/ios-18-could-sherlock-400m-in-app-revenue/", "timestamp": "1719366350.43683", "displayed": 0}

This version of ChatGPT will have \u201cslightly more restrictive content policies,\u201d according to OpenAI. When TechCrunch asked for more details, however, the response was unclear:\n\n\u201cThe signed out experience will benefit from the existing safety mitigations that are already built into the model, such as refusing to generate harmful content. In addition to these existing mitigations, we are also implementing additional safeguards specifically designed to address other forms of content that may be inappropriate for a signed out experience,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\nMarch 2024\n\nOpenAI\u2019s chatbot store is filling up with spam\n\nTechCrunch found that the OpenAI\u2019s GPT Store is flooded with bizarre, potentially copyright-infringing GPTs.

How does it work?\n\nChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.\n\nWhen did ChatGPT get released?\n\nNovember 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.\n\nWhat is the latest version of ChatGPT?\n\nBoth the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.\n\nCan I use ChatGPT for free?\n\nThere is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.\n\nWho uses ChatGPT?\n\nAnyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.\n\nWhat companies use ChatGPT?\n\nMultiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.\n\nMost recently, Microsoft announced at it\u2019s 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.\n\nWhat does GPT mean in ChatGPT?\n\nGPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.\n\nWhat is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?\n\nA chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they\u2019ll give canned responses to questions.\n\nChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.\n\nCan ChatGPT write essays?\n\nYes.\n\nCan ChatGPT commit libel?\n\nDue to the nature of how these models work, they don\u2019t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That\u2019s a problem when you\u2019re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn\u2019t commit, that may well at this point be libel.\n\nWe will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.\n\nDoes ChatGPT have an app?\n\nYes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.\n\nWhat is the ChatGPT character limit?\n\nIt\u2019s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.\n\nDoes ChatGPT have an API?\n\nYes, it was released March 1, 2023.\n\nWhat are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?\n\nEveryday examples include programing, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.\n\nWhat are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?\n\nAdvanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.\n\nHow good is ChatGPT at writing code?\n\nIt depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can\u2019t necessarily program an entire app\u2019s worth of code. That\u2019s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness \u2014 in other words, the generated code isn\u2019t always appropriate for the specific context in which it\u2019s being used.\n\nCan you save a ChatGPT chat?\n\nYes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.\n\nAre there alternatives to ChatGPT?\n\nYes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google\u2019s Gemini and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.\n\nHow does ChatGPT handle data privacy?\n\nOpenAI has said that individuals in \u201ccertain jurisdictions\u201d (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression \u201cin accordance with applicable laws\u201d.\n\nThe web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled \u201cOpenAI Personal Data Removal Request\u201d.\n\nIn its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on \u201clegitimate interest\u201d (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out \u2014 when it writes: \u201cSee here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.\u201d\n\nWhat controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?\n\nRecently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI\u2019s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.\n\nAn Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT\u2019s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.\n\nCNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.\n\nSeveral major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.\n\nThere have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.\n\nWhere can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?\n\nSeveral marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.\n\nCan ChatGPT be detected?\n\nPoorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they\u2019re inconsistent at best.\n\nAre ChatGPT chats public?\n\nNo. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users\u2019 conversations to other people on the service.\n\nWhat lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?\n\nNone specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.\n\nAre there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?\n\nYes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.", "authors": "['Kyle Wiggers', 'Cody Corrall', 'Alyssa Stringer']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1462188043.jpg?resize=1200,798", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/17/chatgpt-everything-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot/", "timestamp": "1719366356.8159418", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "10 of the most exciting digital health startups of 2024, according to VCs", "text": "In the post-COVID world, VCs say it\u2019s not as easy to get excited about investing in digital health. Deal activity in healthcare IT was relatively flat in Q1 2024 at 74 total deals, valued at about $1 billion total, up only 3% from the year-ago quarter, according to PitchBook data.\n\nStill, promising startups have grabbed investors\u2019 attention this year. TechCrunch spoke with about a dozen healthcare VCs about the companies they think have the most promising future. While recently formed AI-driven startups that are solving staggering administrative challenges in the U.S. healthcare system dominated their recommendations, they also mentioned several slightly older, non-AI-focused businesses.\n\nWe narrowed their suggestions to the list of names that more than one VC mentioned, which came in at an even 10 companies. VCs discussed with us the companies that were both in their portfolios and not.\n\nAbridge\n\nWhat it does: Uses AI to automate medical records based on conversations between doctors and patients.\n\nFounded in 2018 by Shiv Rao, a practicing cardiologist, Abridge is an early entrant into the medical note-taking space and one that has secured integration with the all-powerful Epic Systems health records software.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: The Pittsburgh-based startup generates excitement among investors and hospital systems eager to free up physicians\u2019 time spent on note-taking. Abridge is the health tech startup that among investors we talked to was mentioned the most.\n\nSome investors said that Abridge is leading its category. Other companies competing to dominate the AI-powered medical note-taking market include Ambience, Nabla, Microsoft-owned Nuance and Suki.\n\nFunding: In February, Abridge raised a $150 million Series C led by Lightspeed Ventures at a valuation of $850 million, a mere four months after the virtual medical scribe startup grabbed a $30 million Series B from Spark Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners, CVS Health Ventures and others.\n\nCodaMetrix\n\nWhat it does: Founded in 2019, CodaMetrix uses AI to automate medical coding. The company\u2019s technology translates medical notes stored in electronic health records into diagnostic codes, helping to reduce errors and administrative burdens.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Medical coding is tedious and error-prone. Entering an incorrect code for a condition or treatment can lead to insurance rejection of claims and other administrative problems. Moreover, the burden of entering codes falls on already busy physicians and nurses, leading to increased stress and burnout.\n\nThe company has competitors, including Fathom Health, but investors say that CodaMetrix has one of the largest annotated coding datasets.\n\nFunding and valuation: In March, CodaMetrix grabbed a $40 million Series B from Transformation Capital with participation of returning investors SignalFire and Cressey Ventures. The deal valued the Boston-based company at $220 million, according to PitchBook.\n\nCohere Health\n\nWhat it does: Cohere Health expedites health insurance approval process, known as prior authorization, for medical conditions with the help of AI.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Prior authorization management could take medical and administrative staff hours as it requires gathering appropriate documentation for submission to health insurers or Medicaid. Cohere Health\u2019s AI can reduce the time it takes to do this to minutes, saving medical and administrative staff hours on these tasks.\n\nInvestors say that Cohere is for now the leader in the space, but other startups that expedite health insurance approval for medical conditions include Anterior and Alaffia Health.\n\nFunding: Cohere Health raised a $50 million Series B earlier this year from Deerfield Management with participation from Define Ventures, Polaris Partners, Longitude Capital and Flare Capital Partners.\n\nGrow Therapy\n\nWhat it does: Grow Therapy connects therapists who want to start independent practices with patients and insurers. Founded in 2020, the startup employs the so-called business-in-box model because it gives mental health professionals tools for filing claims, receiving payments and being matched with patients.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: The company claims that its business model offers therapists more flexibility than if they were to provide their services through marketplaces like Headway or Lyra. While it\u2019s not clear whether that\u2019s indeed the case, Grow, true to its name, is growing fast, investors say.\n\nFunding and valaution: In April, Grow closed an $88 million Series C led by Sequoia at a $1.4 billion valuation, according to PitchBook data.\n\nEquip\n\nWhat it does: Four-year-old Equip provides online treatment for kids, teens and adults in all 50 states and accepts most health insurances. Equip providers are also trained to address co-occurring conditions like anxiety, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: About 10% of the U.S. population develops an eating disorder during their lives, but only a fraction of these people receive help, according to the National Eating Disorders Association. The company\u2019s offering brings care to those who don\u2019t live near an eating disorder facility or prefer to be treated online.\n\nFunding and valuation: Equip was last valued at $505 million and has secured a total of $135 million in funding from investors, including Optum Ventures and General Catalyst, according to PitchBook data.\n\nMaven\n\nWhat it does: The New York-based health clinic and benefits platform offers services for fertility, adoption, parenting, pediatrics and menopause through employers, including Microsoft and AT&T. Maven also serves Medicaid patients.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Investors say that 10-year-old Maven continues to grow, given that its area of focus \u2014 digital health services for women and families \u2014 has been historically underserved. While VC interest in women\u2019s health has grown in recent years, the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022 has shined an even brighter spotlight on the need for technologies that serve the female population.\n\nFunding and valuation: Since its founding, Maven has raised nearly $300 million in funding and was last valued in late 2022 at $1.35 billion in a Series E round led by General Catalyst with the participation of VCs, including Lux Capital, Oak HC/FT and Sequoia.\n\nMemora Health\n\nWhat it does: Memora Health offers virtual AI-based care coordination, reducing administrative burdens for medical staff. The company\u2019s technology uses text messages to communicate with patients, automating tasks like appointment reminders, answering patients\u2019 common questions and collecting data about symptoms and post-procedure recovery.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Like many other AI-based healthcare startups, Memora saves medical staff time. The company also helps patients feel more supported on their health journey.\n\nFunding: The company spun out of Harvard Innovation Lab and went through Y Combinator in 2018. Since then, it has raised nearly $80 million and was valued in April 2023 at $430 million, according to PitchBook data. Memora\u2019s investors include General Catalyst and Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nSmarterDx\n\nWhat it does: Founded in 2020, SmarterDx uses AI to help hospitals not miss out on revenues by analyzing patients\u2019 lab results, medications and doctors\u2019 notes to find minor errors and omissions in patients\u2019 diagnoses and associated medical codes. The company\u2019s technology reviews patient charts for accuracy before a claim is sent to health insurance or Medicare.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Investors say that since Smarter Dx helps health systems realize more revenues, the value of the company\u2019s technology is easy to measure.\n\nFunding: In May, SmarterDx raised a $50 million Series B round led by Transformation Capital, with participation from Bessemer Venture Partners, Flare Capital Partners and Floodgate Fund. The latest capital infusion brought the company\u2019s total funding to $71 million.\n\nSummer Health\n\nWhat it does: The two-year-old Summer Health connects parents to pediatricians who, within minutes, respond to urgent care and behavioral concerns. The company provides its text messaging service directly to consumers and through employers who offer access to Summer Health as a benefit.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Busy and worried parents want answers to their children\u2019s health issues right away and around the clock. Summer Health reduces parents\u2019 concerns because they can get fast responses to their questions via an app.\n\nFunding: In April, Summer Health raised its $12 million Series A led by 7wireVentures and existing investors including Sequoia, Lux Capital and Chelsea Clinton\u2019s Metrodora Ventures.\n\nTranscarent\n\nWhat it does: Four-year-old Transcarent helps large companies save money on providing health insurance to employees. The startup gives employees access to discounted medications, telehealth services and personalized AI-generated answers about their health coverage.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Part of the company\u2019s fast rise could be attributed to its founder, Glen Tullman, who previously started Livongo, a chronic condition management company Teledoc acquired for $18.5 billion in 2020.\n\nThe company also recently introduced an AI platform that answers members\u2019 questions about coverage, offers clinical information and connects them with medical staff as needed.\n\nFunding and valuation: In May, the company raised a $450 million Series D at a $2.2 billion valuation led by General Catalyst and 7wireVentures.", "authors": "['Marina Temkin']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-927809262.jpg?resize=1200,600", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/10-of-the-most-exciting-digital-health-startups-of-2024-according-to-vcs/", "timestamp": "1719366380.33484", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "Fearless Fund\u2019s founder has resigned, and it\u2019s a sad reflection on the VC world for Black women", "text": "On Monday, Fearless Fund\u2019s co-founder Ayana Parsons announced that she was stepping down from her leadership role from the firm. She will no longer be its general partner and COO but will be off \u201cenjoying island life\u201d with her family, she said in a LinkedIn post. She co-founded the fund in 2019 with partner Arian Simone, who remains its CEO.\n\nFearless Fund was founded with a mission to provide venture capital financing, grants and financial education to startups founded by Black women. That\u2019s a demographic that is both particularly underserved and promising. Less than 1% of all VC dollars in 2023 went to Black-founded startups, which amounts to around $661 million out of $136 billion, according to Crunchbase data.\n\nSo Fearless Fund is doing exactly what venture capitalists are supposed to do: find an overlooked area (in Silicon Valley they might call it taking a \u201ccontrarian view\u201d) and invest. The fund has so far invested $26 million into over 40 companies that include Slutty Vegan, The Lip Bar, Partake Foods, and Live Tinted, Atlanta Daily World reports.\n\nThe money invested and granted is from private limited partners. The LPs who supported the fund want to support this thesis. The companies receiving money are still private startups. Since so little classic VC funding is going to these businesses, the community is building their own rails. Everyone in this ecosystem is OK with this.\n\nStill, it is being sued by a politically conservative group called the American Alliance for Equal Rights (AAER) over its charitable grants program. AAER is challenging the fund\u2019s right to provide $20,000 in small business grants to Black women, claiming the program violates the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which bans the use of race in contracts.\n\nAAER was founded by Edward Blum, an activist who helped successfully overturn affirmative action in universities and is now conducting several other lawsuits in similar veins (e.g., the AAER is currently suing the Smithsonian Institute\u2019s Latino Museum Studies Program for hiring Latino interns).\n\nThe case is not going particularly well for Fearless Fund. As TechCrunch recently reported, earlier this month an appeals court ruled against Fearless. It upheld a preliminary injunction that prevents the firm from making grants to Black women business owners. The firm told TechCrunch at that time it is weighing its options on how to proceed.\n\nLast year, when the case made national news, numerous founders and investors told TechCrunch about the infuriating irony of using the Civil Rights Act of 1866 to protest the firm\u2019s program, as it was initially put into place to help the formerly enslaved and is now being used against the community it sought to help.\n\nIn the months that followed, the frustration of this case within the community has not lessened. Earlier on Monday, Parsons had an emotional moment onstage at the ForbesBLK Summit in Atlanta. She was joined by political leader Stacey Abrams and the chief diversity officer of Congress, Dr. Sesha Joi Moon.\n\n\u201cAnytime you are surrounded by Black women, they are going to pour into you,\u2019\u2019 Parsons said, according to Forbes. \u201cSo, when I walked on this stage, these eyes were watering because they understood the heavy burden that is on all of us in this country.\u2019\u2019\n\nAfter announcing her resignation, Parsons told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and her spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the lawsuit against Fearless was not a motivating factor. But she did not otherwise explain her decision to leave. She also remains an investor in the fund. \u201cAs co-founder, Ayana is still an investor and she has always had multiple ventures centered around inclusion leadership and development, venture capital, and entrepreneurship. Fearless Fund is merely one avenue in her pursuit to be an advocate for the marginalized,\u201d her spokesperson said.\n\nParsons said in her LinkedIn post that she founded the firm \u201cto help change the game for women of color entrepreneurs. And my rationale was simple: women of color are the most founded yet the least funded. They are starting businesses at a faster rate than any other demographic yet lack access to the capital, resources, education and networks needed to scale their businesses.\u201d\n\nShe also promised not to give up on her goal. \u201cI remain steadfast in my support of and commitment to the advancement of women of color,\u201d she said in an emailed statement, mentioning that she\u2019ll soon be publishing a book, too.\n\nStill, as we previously pointed out, the sad fact is that big names in the tech ecosystem have not exactly come out swinging in support. CEO Simone told Inc. earlier this year that the fund had lost nearly all its partnerships aside from two, JPMorgan and Costco. Even Mastercard, who sponsored the now-contested Strivers Grant, has publicly never commented on the lawsuit.\n\nIndeed, support for anything considered DEI has done a complete pendulum swing in tech in 2024, from its height in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd.

But it won\u2019t reveal how much.\n\nGreycroft, Coatue Management, Sound Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, O\u2019Shaughnessy Ventures and angel investors Prem Akkaraju, ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt, Robert Nelsen and Napster founder and ex-Facebook exec Sean Parker have injected fresh capital into Stability, the company revealed Tuesday morning. Parker has joined Stability AI as executive board chairman, sitting alongside Greycroft managing partner Dana Settle, Coatue Management COO Colin Bryant and Akkaraju \u2014 who\u2019s been appointed Stability\u2019s CEO \u2014 on the company\u2019s board of directors.\n\n\u201cStability AI has made a global impact by creating the leading generative image foundation models and fostering the largest ecosystem of generative AI media creators and developers,\u201d Parker said in a statement. \u201cInnovation happens at the intersection of art and technology: the company\u2019s world-class research and applied AI teams collaborate with a vibrant community of AI artists, model builders and developers who have ingeniously extended the capabilities of the company\u2019s core models.\u201d\n\nThe announcement was preempted by The Information earlier this week, which revealed in a scoop that Stability AI was close to reaching a deal with VCs as it faces a cash crunch and unpaid cloud bills. Both The Information and Reuters reported that the fundraise could result in a lower valuation for the startup; Stability AI declined to comment.\n\nStability rose to prominence in 2022 after the release of Stable Diffusion, an image-generating AI model developed at Ludwig Maximilian University in collaboration with AI startup Runway. Stability delivered updates to the open source model and built services around it, eventually commercializing it and growing Stable Diffusion into one of the most widely used open image-generating models today.\n\nStability\u2019s ambitions grew in the subsequent years, and the startup ventured into a number of domains, including code, text, doodle, music, sound, 3D model and video generation and even biomedical research. But the company\u2019s co-founder and ex-CEO, Emad Mostaque, reportedly mismanaged Stability into financial ruin, leading staff to resign, a partnership with Canva to fall through and investors to grow concerned about Stability\u2019s prospects.\n\nStability had just $4 million in the bank last October, per reports \u2014 a far cry from the over $100 million in capital it raised in the proceeding years from investors including Intel \u2014 and was projected to make just $11 million in sales in 2023. Meanwhile, the company was on the hook for $99 million a year for cloud infrastructure rentals from AWS, Google Cloud and CoreWeave to train and run its models and $53 million in operating expenses and wages.\n\nBy December, Stability had pivoted to a subscription model for commercial use of its technology with prices starting at $20 per month. The company also considered reselling its compute resources as a managed service, according to reporting \u2014 and, at the urging of Lightspeed, selling itself.\n\nMostaque left in March following pressure from investors.\n\nStability\u2019s new investors, including Schmidt, have committed $80 million to effectively take over Stability; struck a deal with the startup\u2019s suppliers to forgive some $100 million in debt; and negotiated for Stability to be released from $300 million in future obligations largely meant to go to cloud infrastructure providers, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear where Stability goes from here. Key talent including several researchers behind the development of Stable Diffusion, as well as Ed Newton-Rex, who was heading up Stability\u2019s generative AI audio efforts, have left.

{"title": "Notion Sites takes Notion sites up a level", "text": "Popular productivity tool Notion has long allowed its users to make any of their pages public. Now, the company is expanding on this with the launch of Notion Sites, which adds several new features to its existing publishing tools. For the most part, these are pretty straightforward, but together, they do make for a more polished publishing experience.\n\nA lot of content-centric work already happens in Notion, be that organizing publishing calendars or actually working on documents. Over the years, Notion users figured out all kinds of ways to turn their pages into websites \u2014 and some startups were even founded solely on that idea. Given that there\u2019s a clear demand, it makes sense then for the company to lean into publishing that work directly.\n\nImage Credits: Notion\n\n\u201cOne of the best features of Notion has always been that with a single click, you can turn a Notion page into a publicly facing website,\u201d Notion product lead Matt Piccolella told me ahead of today\u2019s launch. \u201cThe problem with these pages is that they\u2019ve always been missing many of the bells and whistles that you might expect to see on a website.\u201d\n\nNotion Sites adds some of those bells and whistles. Specifically, that means the ability to do things like customizing favicons and building navigation bars with links, as well as using breadcrumb navigation. These Notion Sites can now also easily be published under custom domains and, for better visibility and analytics, there are also basic SEO features (mostly title and description) as well as a Google Analytics integration. Notion users can now also customize their share previews to define how a site is represented on social media. And for finding information on the sites themselves, Notion has added a search feature.\n\nLike before, the idea here is to help users publish any Notion page they may have been working on internally and then make those publicly available. That also means that virtually every existing Notion feature will appear on the public Notion Site, too.\n\nImage Credits: Notion\n\nOne thing the team has very specifically stayed away from, though, is the ability to customize sites in detail. There\u2019s a dark and light mode, just like in Notion itself, but that\u2019s about it. Over time, Piccolella said, the team plans to add more visual theming options. The mission here, Piccolella said, is to make this the \u201csimplest way to publish a beautiful website\u201d \u2014 that means a lot of choice for the user.\n\n\u201cI think one of the benefits of Notion is that you get that kind of Notion look and feel, which is kind of effortlessly beautiful,\u201d he said. \u201cFonts are going to look really nice and the colors are going to look really nice, without having to comb through tons of different visual styling and things like that. It\u2019s actually kind of the visual minimalism that we like.\u201d\n\nLike seemingly every company, Notion is also thinking about how it can add AI functionality to help users build their Notion Sites but also to make AI features available to their users. Piccolella wasn\u2019t yet ready to go into details about what that would look like, though.", "authors": "['Frederic Lardinois']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-114847550.jpg?resize=1200,780", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/notion-sites/", "timestamp": "1719366409.181338", "displayed": 0}

Over the years, Notion users figured out all kinds of ways to turn their pages into websites \u2014 and some startups were even founded solely on that idea. Given that there\u2019s a clear demand, it makes sense then for the company to lean into publishing that work directly.\n\nImage Credits: Notion\n\n\u201cOne of the best features of Notion has always been that with a single click, you can turn a Notion page into a publicly facing website,\u201d Notion product lead Matt Piccolella told me ahead of today\u2019s launch. \u201cThe problem with these pages is that they\u2019ve always been missing many of the bells and whistles that you might expect to see on a website.\u201d\n\nNotion Sites adds some of those bells and whistles. Specifically, that means the ability to do things like customizing favicons and building navigation bars with links, as well as using breadcrumb navigation. These Notion Sites can now also easily be published under custom domains and, for better visibility and analytics, there are also basic SEO features (mostly title and description) as well as a Google Analytics integration. Notion users can now also customize their share previews to define how a site is represented on social media. And for finding information on the sites themselves, Notion has added a search feature.\n\nLike before, the idea here is to help users publish any Notion page they may have been working on internally and then make those publicly available. That also means that virtually every existing Notion feature will appear on the public Notion Site, too.\n\nImage Credits: Notion\n\nOne thing the team has very specifically stayed away from, though, is the ability to customize sites in detail. There\u2019s a dark and light mode, just like in Notion itself, but that\u2019s about it. Over time, Piccolella said, the team plans to add more visual theming options. The mission here, Piccolella said, is to make this the \u201csimplest way to publish a beautiful website\u201d \u2014 that means a lot of choice for the user.\n\n\u201cI think one of the benefits of Notion is that you get that kind of Notion look and feel, which is kind of effortlessly beautiful,\u201d he said. \u201cFonts are going to look really nice and the colors are going to look really nice, without having to comb through tons of different visual styling and things like that. It\u2019s actually kind of the visual minimalism that we like.\u201d\n\nLike seemingly every company, Notion is also thinking about how it can add AI functionality to help users build their Notion Sites but also to make AI features available to their users. Piccolella wasn\u2019t yet ready to go into details about what that would look like, though.", "authors": "['Frederic Lardinois']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-114847550.jpg?resize=1200,780", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/notion-sites/", "timestamp": "1719366412.885893", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "Smashing, from Goodreads\u2019 co-founder, curates the best of the web using AI and human recommendations", "text": "Goodreads\u2018 co-founder Otis Chandler is back to build the next big app community. But this time, his focus isn\u2019t on books; it\u2019s on the content you can find online, including news articles, blog posts, social media posts, podcasts and more. With Smashing, an AI and community-powered content recommendation app, now launching into an invite-only beta, the goal is to help connect users to their interests by surfacing the internet\u2019s hidden gems.\n\nThe launch comes at a time when many news consumers are still lamenting the loss of Artifact, the AI news reader from Instagram\u2019s co-founder that recently sold to TechCrunch parent Yahoo.\n\nAt the same time, the media ecosystem is becoming more fragmented than ever with journalists establishing their own newsletters and Substacks. Twitter, once a hot spot for finding the latest breaking news, has morphed into a more right-leaning app \u201cX,\u201d whose existence has prompted a host of new competitors. In addition, changes at Google and Meta have resulted in a sizable drop in traffic to online publishers, leading to widespread media layoffs. And with AI, the situation looks like it may worsen, as apps and Google begin offering AI summaries of news, potentially losing publishers even more clicks.\n\nChandler believes Smashing can address many of these problems by not only surfacing the articles and posts that are worth people\u2019s time but also encouraging users to visit the publishers\u2019 sites to read more.\n\n\u201cI named Goodreads \u2018Goodreads\u2019 and not \u2018Goodbooks\u2019 because I one day hoped to add articles,\u201d Chandler said. As it turned out, \u201cbooks\u201d was a large enough category on its own to sustain the app, which sold to Amazon in 2013. Chandler continued to work there until five years ago.\n\nImage Credits: Smashing\n\nThe Smashing CEO says he always had an \u201citch to scratch around the rest of the content on the web, which is not just articles.\u201d It\u2019s podcasts, blogs, news articles, tweets, social media posts and YouTube videos, he says. \u201cAny interesting content.\u201d\n\nImage Credits: Smashing\n\nWhat prompted him to start building Smashing, however, was an experience he had during his sabbatical from work following his departure from Amazon. After a month or two of downtime, Chandler decided to challenge himself by entering a Half Ironman triathlon.\n\n\u201cThat led me down a journey of, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve got to learn about training and bicycling, and how to stay in shape and not burn my legs out, and how to eat right for nutrition, how to, therefore, cook better, because I didn\u2019t know how to cook before that,\u201d he said. But, when trying to use a traditional search engine, it was hard to find the best content. \u201cIf you just Google, \u2018how to train for a Half Ironman Triathlon\u2019 or \u2018how to eat healthy,\u2019 you get a lot of content. But it\u2019s not the content you\u2019re really looking for. It\u2019s a lot of SEO-optimized, ad-stuffed pages.\u201d\n\nTo try to find the content he wanted, Chandler tried news aggregators, like Apple News and Google News, Reddit, Twitter, social media and other smaller and medium-sized apps.\n\n\u201cI tried everything I could find, and I was really dissatisfied with the answers I got. I couldn\u2019t find anything I could dial to give me just good, interesting, accurate content. And that led me to the thesis for Smashing,\u201d Chandler said.\n\nHe then teamed up in 2022 with a former co-worker, Greg Veen, now a Smashing co-founder, whose tech background includes founding Measure Map, which sold to Google, and Typekit, which exited to Adobe.\n\nFrom user research, they found that people generally had five or six main interests they\u2019d follow online, including a few related to work and a few that were personal interests. They would follow sources that ranged from niche newsletters to social media influencers to publications and more. But they reported feeling overwhelmed.\n\nImage Credits: Smashing\n\nBuilt over the last year, following a seed round, Smashing\u2019s iOS app lets users follow their interests in a way that\u2019s reminiscent of another AI news app, Artifact, but with a broader focus. Users can submit their own content and thumbs up and down the app\u2019s AI-powered recommendations of content shared by others and aggregated from the web. However, it\u2019s not only limited to news: Anything with a URL can be submitted.\n\nSimilar to Digg, a news aggregator from the Web 2.0 era, users can vote up the content they think is interesting and deserves attention. But users will only get 30 votes per day, which they can spend all on one amazing article, or distribute across a wider number of links, depending on their preference.\n\nAs with Artifact, users can like, save and comment on articles, too, which further helps surface the best content.\n\nAI technology in Smashing offers summaries of the news, key excepts and interesting pull quotes. AI also helps to identify topics and threads of interest to individual users, but the real \u201cmagic happens,\u201d Chandler says, by creating a community that works in conjunction with the AI.\n\nImage Credits: Smashing\n\nBut despite its use of AI, Chandler argues that Smashing should drive traffic to online publishers, not lessen it. \u201cWe really designed Smashing to be something that helps you curate interesting, long-form content and drives readers to it. We\u2019re not trying to be an aggregated replacement for reading it.

{"title": "Smashing, from Goodreads\u2019 co-founder, curates the best of the web using AI and human recommendations", "text": "Goodreads\u2018 co-founder Otis Chandler is back to build the next big app community. But this time, his focus isn\u2019t on books; it\u2019s on the content you can find online, including news articles, blog posts, social media posts, podcasts and more. With Smashing, an AI and community-powered content recommendation app, now launching into an invite-only beta, the goal is to help connect users to their interests by surfacing the internet\u2019s hidden gems.\n\nThe launch comes at a time when many news consumers are still lamenting the loss of Artifact, the AI news reader from Instagram\u2019s co-founder that recently sold to TechCrunch parent Yahoo.\n\nAt the same time, the media ecosystem is becoming more fragmented than ever with journalists establishing their own newsletters and Substacks. Twitter, once a hot spot for finding the latest breaking news, has morphed into a more right-leaning app \u201cX,\u201d whose existence has prompted a host of new competitors. In addition, changes at Google and Meta have resulted in a sizable drop in traffic to online publishers, leading to widespread media layoffs. And with AI, the situation looks like it may worsen, as apps and Google begin offering AI summaries of news, potentially losing publishers even more clicks.\n\nChandler believes Smashing can address many of these problems by not only surfacing the articles and posts that are worth people\u2019s time but also encouraging users to visit the publishers\u2019 sites to read more.\n\n\u201cI named Goodreads \u2018Goodreads\u2019 and not \u2018Goodbooks\u2019 because I one day hoped to add articles,\u201d Chandler said. As it turned out, \u201cbooks\u201d was a large enough category on its own to sustain the app, which sold to Amazon in 2013. Chandler continued to work there until five years ago.\n\nImage Credits: Smashing\n\nThe Smashing CEO says he always had an \u201citch to scratch around the rest of the content on the web, which is not just articles.\u201d It\u2019s podcasts, blogs, news articles, tweets, social media posts and YouTube videos, he says. \u201cAny interesting content.\u201d\n\nImage Credits: Smashing\n\nWhat prompted him to start building Smashing, however, was an experience he had during his sabbatical from work following his departure from Amazon. After a month or two of downtime, Chandler decided to challenge himself by entering a Half Ironman triathlon.\n\n\u201cThat led me down a journey of, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve got to learn about training and bicycling, and how to stay in shape and not burn my legs out, and how to eat right for nutrition, how to, therefore, cook better, because I didn\u2019t know how to cook before that,\u201d he said. But, when trying to use a traditional search engine, it was hard to find the best content. \u201cIf you just Google, \u2018how to train for a Half Ironman Triathlon\u2019 or \u2018how to eat healthy,\u2019 you get a lot of content. But it\u2019s not the content you\u2019re really looking for. It\u2019s a lot of SEO-optimized, ad-stuffed pages.\u201d\n\nTo try to find the content he wanted, Chandler tried news aggregators, like Apple News and Google News, Reddit, Twitter, social media and other smaller and medium-sized apps.\n\n\u201cI tried everything I could find, and I was really dissatisfied with the answers I got. I couldn\u2019t find anything I could dial to give me just good, interesting, accurate content. And that led me to the thesis for Smashing,\u201d Chandler said.\n\nHe then teamed up in 2022 with a former co-worker, Greg Veen, now a Smashing co-founder, whose tech background includes founding Measure Map, which sold to Google, and Typekit, which exited to Adobe.\n\nFrom user research, they found that people generally had five or six main interests they\u2019d follow online, including a few related to work and a few that were personal interests. They would follow sources that ranged from niche newsletters to social media influencers to publications and more. But they reported feeling overwhelmed.\n\nImage Credits: Smashing\n\nBuilt over the last year, following a seed round, Smashing\u2019s iOS app lets users follow their interests in a way that\u2019s reminiscent of another AI news app, Artifact, but with a broader focus. Users can submit their own content and thumbs up and down the app\u2019s AI-powered recommendations of content shared by others and aggregated from the web. However, it\u2019s not only limited to news: Anything with a URL can be submitted.\n\nSimilar to Digg, a news aggregator from the Web 2.0 era, users can vote up the content they think is interesting and deserves attention. But users will only get 30 votes per day, which they can spend all on one amazing article, or distribute across a wider number of links, depending on their preference.\n\nAs with Artifact, users can like, save and comment on articles, too, which further helps surface the best content.\n\nAI technology in Smashing offers summaries of the news, key excepts and interesting pull quotes. AI also helps to identify topics and threads of interest to individual users, but the real \u201cmagic happens,\u201d Chandler says, by creating a community that works in conjunction with the AI.\n\nImage Credits: Smashing\n\nBut despite its use of AI, Chandler argues that Smashing should drive traffic to online publishers, not lessen it. \u201cWe really designed Smashing to be something that helps you curate interesting, long-form content and drives readers to it. We\u2019re not trying to be an aggregated replacement for reading it. I know a lot of people are playing with that kind of model,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, no surprise to you, having done Goodreads, I\u2019m a believer in long-form, interesting content.

{"title": "k-ID wins $45M to help game devs speedrun the child safety compliance puzzle", "text": "For an indie developer building a game on their own, compliance with regulations is likely the last thing on their list of priorities \u2014 they first have to finish writing the code, designing the mechanics and running endless rounds of tests to make sure the game is actually fun to play. But compliance is often not a choice, especially when it comes to child safety, and that\u2019s a task that gets harder every year as regulations evolve fast and frequently around the world.\n\nA startup called k-ID wants to smoothen that compliance journey, and it has now raised $45 million in a Series A round to build out its platform that makes it easy for game devs to comply with child safety and data privacy regulations.\n\nAndreessen Horowitz, an existing investor in the startup, and Lightspeed Venture Partners led the funding round. Okta, Z Venture Capital (owned by Z Holdings, a JV between SoftBank and Naver), and existing backers Konvoy Ventures and TIRTA Ventures also participated in the round.

The firm doubled down on the company, leading the $40 million Series B and a previously unannounced follow-on to its Series A round.\n\nKyle Doherty, managing director at General Catalyst, said ghost kitchens initially \u201cpromised to drive pivotal change in customer value and efficiency.\u201d However, issues like inauthentic menus, poor quality control, questionable preparation methods and unsustainable unit economics prevented certain business models from gaining a strong foothold in the restaurant industry post-COVID.\n\nBy creating what Doherty called \u201ca new category that\u2019s in our view reflective of the ideal dining experience,\u201d Local Kitchens has \u201cthe perfect blend of prioritizing what consumers need and using innovation to fix restaurant challenges and inefficiencies.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven years after food delivery growth proved to be a long-lasting trend, customers are still being forced to sacrifice the factors that make eating out enjoyable, and choose between high-quality food and good service,\u201d Doherty told TechCrunch. \u201cLocal Kitchens is accomplishing what other food delivery models have not been capable of \u2014 meeting customer experience preferences, driving unparalleled efficiency, and creating a solution that delights consumers, chefs and local communities alike.\u201d\n\nGeneral Catalyst was joined by other existing investors Human Capital, Pear VC and Stanley Tang, co-founder of DoorDash, who joins the company\u2019s board of directors. This brings Local Kitchens\u2019 total funding to $75 million.\n\n\u201cStanley has been a friend and a mentor to us,\u201d Goldsmith said. \u201cHe\u2019s also been involved with Local Kitchens since the beginning of the company, and we\u2019re excited to have him officially join the board.\u201d", "authors": "['Christine Hall']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Copy-of-Founder-Pic.jpeg?resize=1200,700", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/local-kitchens-general-catalyst-40m/", "timestamp": "1719366481.955343", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "Foray Bioscience is breaking down the barriers of bringing biomanufacturing to plants", "text": "Ashley Beckwith spent years of her academic and professional career focused on the intersection of biology, materials and manufacturing to build medical solutions more efficiently. When she realized the tech could be applied to plants and plant-based materials, an area that desperately needed it, she decided to switch gears.\n\n\u201cLife on earth is only as secure as our global plant populations, and today our plant populations are really in crisis,\u201d Beckwith told TechCrunch. \u201cNearly 40% of our plant species are threatened by extinction. Forest landscapes unscathed by humans shrunk 12% [in 2022]. These plant resources are being squeezed on all fronts.\u201d\n\nBeckwith took what she knew about biomanufacturing, the process of using microorganisms and cell cultures to produce biological molecules and materials on a commercial scale, and launched Foray Bioscience in February 2022. The company uses biomanufacturing to grow harvest-free plant-based materials, seeds and molecules.\n\nBiomanufacturing has been around for about 100 years, Beckwith said, but it hasn\u2019t had many practical use cases for plants thus far. Because each plant species is so different, there wasn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all approach to cultivate cells, which made biomanufacturing with plant cell cultures laborious. Foray looks to change that through its database approach; it provides predictive insights and experimental direction to help speed up the research and development process for each plant species.\n\n\u201cAt Foray, we are developing these advanced tools for plant-less production to ask less of these resources and start to give back more,\u201d Beckwith said.\n\nThe Cambridge, Massachusetts-based startup raised a $3 million seed round led by ReGen Ventures, an Australian firm focused on backing technology that helps restore the planet\u2019s resources. Engine Ventures, Understorey Ventures and Superorganism also participated in the round. The startup has now raised $3.875 million in total funding and plans to build out its team.\n\nBeckwith said that it took a while to fundraise the round because what the company is trying to do doesn\u2019t fit squarely into one category but rather at the intersection of many, from manufacturing to biology to conservation. This \u201codd ball\u201d feeling is something Beckwith is used to running up against. She said that the reason she launched the company to begin with is that there wasn\u2019t a natural home for the research she was doing in plant biomanufacturing.\n\n\u201cI was in this weird cross-disciplinary bubble,\u201d Beckwith said. \u201cThat was really apparent to me when I got toward the end of my PhD. If this research was going to move forward and progress, I had to carry it forward into the next iteration of itself. Because of the newness of the field, there wasn\u2019t really a home for it in the academic setting or manufacturing setting. We had to make our own space.\u201d\n\nShe described taking the science out of the lab and launching the company as a \u201clong journey.\u201d The startup currently is working with other companies to help them set up their biomanufacturing by designing their clients a research and development roadmap and helping them develop commercialization strategies.\n\nBeckwith also has a vision that this work will allow Foray to create a genetic banking system for plant seeds, especially those that aren\u2019t easy to document, and allow new seeds to be grown from just a few cells. This will help with conservation efforts, too.\n\nThere are many parallels between Foray\u2019s tech and mission and the rise of lab-grown meat and seafood. While the science isn\u2019t exactly the same, Beckwith said, both have the same goal of replacing products and resources that humans are used to getting from nature with a lab-grown option that\u2019s less harmful to natural environments.

This means people who are blind or who need other assistive devices to help them scan the web are unable to fully engage with most of the world\u2019s websites. TestParty seeks to fix this by automating testing, remediation, training, and code monitoring to bring websites into compliance with accessibility standards.\n\nTan first came across this idea after working at Twitch, which was sued in 2021 for its lack of digital accessibility. Looking more into the issue, Tan realized that disability suits like this were common and that the rapid expansion of the internet has caused many to overlook guardrails that would make their technology more inclusive. He teamed up with Bervell with the belief that engineers can be trained with AI to simply write more accessible website coding.\n\nInclusive technology like this is exactly what advocates talk about when they say they would like to see more innovation with overlooked communities taken into account.

The startup competes against core PSA platforms such as Kantata and project management tools like Asana and Monday.com by combining both.\n\nThe all-equity Series B funding, co-led by 8VC, Matrix Partners India and Nexus Venture Partners, will enable Rocketlane to enhance its PSA platform.\n\nGanesan said that the startup plans to introduce conversational AI to help professional services teams get signals from client meetings on whether customers want to continue to pay for their projects or could take a back seat. Rocketlane is also introducing AI templates for emails and documents that the services teams use. Additionally, the startup is upgrading the customer portal it offers to enterprises for their clients with a website builder-like experience to make it consistent with their brand.\n\nRocketlane currently has 500 paying customers globally, with 60% of its total revenue coming from the U.S. It plans expansion in the U.S. by hiring more leadership and sales positions. Further, it looks to expand into Europe by hosting a one-day event in September.\n\nThe startup has a headcount of 120 people: 15 in the U.S. and the rest in India.\n\nTo date, Rocketlane raised $45 million, with its Series A round of $18 million coming in January 2022. Ganesan said the startup\u2019s valuation grew around 2x the last round, without sharing any specifics. He also mentioned that the startup saw over 3.1x growth in revenues in 2023.", "authors": "['Jagmeet Singh']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/rocketlane-co-founders.jpg?w=1200", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/rocketlane-snags-24m-to-bring-ai-led-experiences-for-professional-services-teams/", "timestamp": "1719366500.037449", "displayed": 0}

It has raised $18 million in a new funding round to expand its presence to more than 40 countries worldwide.\n\nThe Gurugram-based startup works with Indian factories to help them manufacture fashion wear for global brands. It offers ERP (enterprise resource planning) software, which it calls the \u201cbrain of manufacturing,\u201d that tells factories what needs to be produced, how it should be made and when it should be made to let them fully utilize their capacity.\n\nMore than 80,000 small and medium factories in India have a capacity utilization of less than 33%, Zyod co-founder Ankit Jaipuria told TechCrunch. Through its ERP platform, the startup helps factories understand what components \u2014 like fabric \u2014 they need to use to produce clothes for a specific brand. It also explains the pattern in which the fabric should be cut and stitched based on the requirement raised by the brand to get maximum utilization.\n\nFurther, the startup has developed a daily production reporting system to give a day-to-day action plan to factories. This overcomes the challenges that local factories and their labor face in a typical environment where factory owners manage operations through paper and pen or via WhatsApp.\n\n\u201cWe are giving that day-to-day instruction, which earlier was given by a factory owner, and that\u2019s: how it has to be made, when it has to be made, what has to be made \u2014 all of this runs through Zyod, and that\u2019s why I say Zyod acts as a brain of manufacturing, and the factories act as executing arms,\u201d Jaipuria said.\n\nCo-founded in early 2023 by Jaipuria and Ritesh Khandelwal, Zyod currently serves more than 550 customers in over 18 countries, adding about 400 customers in the last two years. The startup initially helped D2C brands with faster launch time and low minimum order quantity. However, in the October quarter, it started onboarding enterprise customers and has since added major brands, including Reliance Industries and Aditya Birla in India. It also counts Japan\u2019s Urban Research, Anthropologie of Pennsylvania, U.K.\u2019s NEXT and Boohoo, and VAN-DOS of Spain among its early clients.\n\nIn January, Zyod launched its mobile app across iOS and Android platforms. It focuses on long-tail customers that want to purchase different styles on the go. The app also helps enterprise clients see their orders. Zyod additionally plans to update the app with new communication methods, including approving orders and communicating with teams through live chat windows.\n\nThe $18 million investment is Zyod\u2019s Series A round led by RTP Global and including participation from existing investors Lightspeed and Alteria Capital and new investors Stride Ventures, Stride One and Trifecta Capital. The money will help the startup grow its presence in the Southern Hemisphere and penetrate markets such as Brazil and Australia. It also looks to enter a few under-tapped countries, including Africa and the Scandinavian part of Europe.\n\n\u201cOnce we have expanded very well into both hemispheres, we can have all-season products consistent for our factories running in India,\u201d Jaipuria said.\n\nZyod has expanded its catalog to 10,000 styles a month from 10 or 20 initially.

{"title": "Emergence thinks it can crack the AI agent code", "text": "Yet another generative AI venture has raised a bundle of money. And, like the others before it, it\u2019s promising the moon.\n\nEmergence, whose co-founders include Satya Nitta, the former head of global AI solutions at IBM\u2019s research division, on Monday emerged from stealth with $97.2 million in funding from Learn Capital plus credit lines totaling more than $100 million. Emergence claims to be building an \u201cagent-based\u201d system that can perform many of the tasks typically handled by knowledge workers, in part by routing these tasks to first- and third-party generative AI models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o.\n\n\u201cAt Emergence, we are working on multiple aspects of the evolving field of generative AI agents,\u201d Nitta, Emergence\u2019s CEO, told TechCrunch. \u201cIn our R&D labs, we are advancing the science of agentic systems and tackling this from a \u2018first principles\u2019 perspective. This includes critical AI tasks such as planning and reasoning as well as self-improvement in agents.\u201d\n\nNitta says that the idea for Emergence came shortly after he co-founded Merlyn Mind, which builds education-oriented virtual assistants. He realized that some of the same technologies developed at Merlyn could be applied to automate workstation software and web apps.\n\nSo Nitta recruited fellow ex-IBMers Ravi Kokku and Sharad Sundararajan to launch Emergence, with the goal of \u201cadvancing the science and development of AI agents,\u201d in Nitta\u2019s words.\n\n\u201cCurrent generative AI models, while powerful in language understanding, still lag in advanced planning and reasoning capabilities necessary for more complex automation tasks which are the provenance of agents,\u201d Nitta said. \u201cThis is what Emergence specializes in.\u201d\n\nEmergence has a very aspirational roadmap that includes a project called Agent E, which seeks to automate tasks like filling out forms, searching for products across online marketplaces and navigating streaming services like Netflix. An early form of Agent E is already available, trained on a mix of synthetic and human-annotated data. But Emergence\u2019s first finished product is what Nitta describes as an \u201corchestrator\u201d agent.\n\nThis orchestrator, open sourced Monday, doesn\u2019t perform any tasks itself. Rather, it functions as a kind of automatic model switcher for workflow automations. Factoring in things like the capabilities of and the cost to use a model (if it\u2019s third party), the orchestrator considers the task to be performed \u2014 for example, writing an email \u2014 then chooses a model from a developer-curated list to complete that task.\n\nAn early version of Emergence\u2019s Agent E project. Image Credits: Emergence\n\n\u201cDevelopers can add appropriate guardrails, use multiple models for their workflows and applications, and seamlessly switch to the latest open source or generalist model on demand without having to worry about issues such as cost, prompt migration or availability,\u201d Nitta said.\n\nEmergence\u2019s orchestrator seems quite similar in concept to AI startup Martian\u2019s model router, which takes in a prompt intended for an AI model and automatically routes it to different models depending on things like uptime and features. Another startup, Credal, provides a more basic model-routing solution driven by hard-coded rules.\n\nNitta doesn\u2019t deny the similarities. But he not-so-subtly suggests that Emergence\u2019s model-routing tech is more reliable than others; he also notes that it offers additional configuration features like a manual model selector, API management and a cost overview dashboard.\n\n\u201cOur orchestrator agent is built with a deep understanding of scalability, robustness and availability that enterprise systems need and is backed by decades of experience that our team possesses in building some of the most scaled AI deployments in the world,\u201d he said.\n\nEmergence intends to monetize the orchestrator with a hosted, available-through-an-API premium version in the coming weeks. But that\u2019s only a slice of the company\u2019s grand plan to build a platform that, among other things, processes claims and documents, manages IT systems, and integrates with customer relationship management systems like Salesforce and Zendesk to triage customer inquiries.\n\nToward this end, Emergence says it\u2019s formed strategic partnerships with Samsung and touch display company Newline Interactive \u2014 both of which are existing Merlyn Mind customers, in what seems unlikely to be a coincidence \u2014 to integrate Emergence\u2019s tech into future products.\n\nAnother screenshot of Emergence\u2019s Agent E in action. Image Credits: Emergence\n\nWhich specific products and when can we expect to see them? Samsung\u2019s WAD interactive displays and Newline\u2019s Q and Q Pro series displays, Nitta said, but he didn\u2019t have an answer to the second question, implying that it\u2019s very early days.\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that AI agents are buzzy right now. Generative AI powerhouses OpenAI and Anthropic are developing task-performing agentic products, as are Big Tech companies, including Google and Amazon.\n\nBut it\u2019s not obvious where Emergence\u2019s differentiation lies, besides the sizable amount of cash out of the starting gate.\n\nTechCrunch recently covered another AI agent startup, Orby, with a similar sales pitch: AI agents trained to work across a range of desktop software. Adept, too, was developing tech along these lines, but despite raising more than $415 million reportedly now finds itself on the brink of a bailout from either Microsoft or Meta.\n\nEmergence is positioning itself as more R&D-heavy than most: the \u201cOpenAI of agents,\u201d if you will, with a research lab dedicated to investigating how agents might plan, reason and self-improve. And it\u2019s drawing from an impressive talent pool; many of its researchers and software engineers hail from Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and the Allen Institute for AI.\n\nNitta says that Emergence\u2019s guiding light will be prioritizing openly available work while building paid services on top of its research, a playbook borrowed from the software-as-a-service sector. Tens of thousands of people are already using early versions of Emergence\u2019s services, he claims.\n\n\u201cOur conviction is that our work becomes foundational to how multiple enterprise workflows get automated in the future,\u201d Nitta said.\n\nColor me skeptical, but I\u2019m not convinced that Emergence\u2019s 50-person team can outgun the rest of the players in the generative AI space \u2014 nor that it\u2019ll solve the overarching technical challenges plaguing generative AI, like hallucinations and the mammoth cost of developing models. Cognition Labs\u2019 Devin, one of the best-performing agents for building and deploying software, only manages to get around a 14% success rate on a benchmark test measuring the ability to resolve issues on GitHub. There\u2019s clearly a lot of work to be done to reach the point where agents can juggle complex processes without oversight.\n\nEmergence has the capital to try \u2014 for now. But it might not in the future as VCs \u2014 and businesses \u2014 express increased skepticism in generative AI tech\u2019s path to ROI.\n\nNitta, projecting the confidence of someone whose startup just raised $100 million, asserted that Emergence is well-positioned for success.\n\n\u201cEmergence is resilient due to its focus on solving fundamental AI infrastructure problems that have a clear and immediate ROI for enterprises,\u201d he said. \u201cOur open-core business model, combined with premium services, ensures a steady revenue stream while fostering a growing community of developers and early adopters.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll see soon enough.", "authors": "['Kyle Wiggers']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nice-A1-Key-Alt-4.jpeg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/24/emergence-thinks-it-can-crack-the-ai-agent-code/", "timestamp": "1719366520.0581708", "displayed": 0}

Emergence claims to be building an \u201cagent-based\u201d system that can perform many of the tasks typically handled by knowledge workers, in part by routing these tasks to first- and third-party generative AI models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o.\n\n\u201cAt Emergence, we are working on multiple aspects of the evolving field of generative AI agents,\u201d Nitta, Emergence\u2019s CEO, told TechCrunch. \u201cIn our R&D labs, we are advancing the science of agentic systems and tackling this from a \u2018first principles\u2019 perspective. This includes critical AI tasks such as planning and reasoning as well as self-improvement in agents.\u201d\n\nNitta says that the idea for Emergence came shortly after he co-founded Merlyn Mind, which builds education-oriented virtual assistants. He realized that some of the same technologies developed at Merlyn could be applied to automate workstation software and web apps.\n\nSo Nitta recruited fellow ex-IBMers Ravi Kokku and Sharad Sundararajan to launch Emergence, with the goal of \u201cadvancing the science and development of AI agents,\u201d in Nitta\u2019s words.\n\n\u201cCurrent generative AI models, while powerful in language understanding, still lag in advanced planning and reasoning capabilities necessary for more complex automation tasks which are the provenance of agents,\u201d Nitta said. \u201cThis is what Emergence specializes in.\u201d\n\nEmergence has a very aspirational roadmap that includes a project called Agent E, which seeks to automate tasks like filling out forms, searching for products across online marketplaces and navigating streaming services like Netflix. An early form of Agent E is already available, trained on a mix of synthetic and human-annotated data. But Emergence\u2019s first finished product is what Nitta describes as an \u201corchestrator\u201d agent.\n\nThis orchestrator, open sourced Monday, doesn\u2019t perform any tasks itself. Rather, it functions as a kind of automatic model switcher for workflow automations. Factoring in things like the capabilities of and the cost to use a model (if it\u2019s third party), the orchestrator considers the task to be performed \u2014 for example, writing an email \u2014 then chooses a model from a developer-curated list to complete that task.\n\nAn early version of Emergence\u2019s Agent E project. Image Credits: Emergence\n\n\u201cDevelopers can add appropriate guardrails, use multiple models for their workflows and applications, and seamlessly switch to the latest open source or generalist model on demand without having to worry about issues such as cost, prompt migration or availability,\u201d Nitta said.\n\nEmergence\u2019s orchestrator seems quite similar in concept to AI startup Martian\u2019s model router, which takes in a prompt intended for an AI model and automatically routes it to different models depending on things like uptime and features. Another startup, Credal, provides a more basic model-routing solution driven by hard-coded rules.\n\nNitta doesn\u2019t deny the similarities. But he not-so-subtly suggests that Emergence\u2019s model-routing tech is more reliable than others; he also notes that it offers additional configuration features like a manual model selector, API management and a cost overview dashboard.\n\n\u201cOur orchestrator agent is built with a deep understanding of scalability, robustness and availability that enterprise systems need and is backed by decades of experience that our team possesses in building some of the most scaled AI deployments in the world,\u201d he said.\n\nEmergence intends to monetize the orchestrator with a hosted, available-through-an-API premium version in the coming weeks. But that\u2019s only a slice of the company\u2019s grand plan to build a platform that, among other things, processes claims and documents, manages IT systems, and integrates with customer relationship management systems like Salesforce and Zendesk to triage customer inquiries.\n\nToward this end, Emergence says it\u2019s formed strategic partnerships with Samsung and touch display company Newline Interactive \u2014 both of which are existing Merlyn Mind customers, in what seems unlikely to be a coincidence \u2014 to integrate Emergence\u2019s tech into future products.\n\nAnother screenshot of Emergence\u2019s Agent E in action. Image Credits: Emergence\n\nWhich specific products and when can we expect to see them? Samsung\u2019s WAD interactive displays and Newline\u2019s Q and Q Pro series displays, Nitta said, but he didn\u2019t have an answer to the second question, implying that it\u2019s very early days.\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that AI agents are buzzy right now. Generative AI powerhouses OpenAI and Anthropic are developing task-performing agentic products, as are Big Tech companies, including Google and Amazon.\n\nBut it\u2019s not obvious where Emergence\u2019s differentiation lies, besides the sizable amount of cash out of the starting gate.\n\nTechCrunch recently covered another AI agent startup, Orby, with a similar sales pitch: AI agents trained to work across a range of desktop software. Adept, too, was developing tech along these lines, but despite raising more than $415 million reportedly now finds itself on the brink of a bailout from either Microsoft or Meta.\n\nEmergence is positioning itself as more R&D-heavy than most: the \u201cOpenAI of agents,\u201d if you will, with a research lab dedicated to investigating how agents might plan, reason and self-improve. And it\u2019s drawing from an impressive talent pool; many of its researchers and software engineers hail from Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and the Allen Institute for AI.\n\nNitta says that Emergence\u2019s guiding light will be prioritizing openly available work while building paid services on top of its research, a playbook borrowed from the software-as-a-service sector. Tens of thousands of people are already using early versions of Emergence\u2019s services, he claims.\n\n\u201cOur conviction is that our work becomes foundational to how multiple enterprise workflows get automated in the future,\u201d Nitta said.\n\nColor me skeptical, but I\u2019m not convinced that Emergence\u2019s 50-person team can outgun the rest of the players in the generative AI space \u2014 nor that it\u2019ll solve the overarching technical challenges plaguing generative AI, like hallucinations and the mammoth cost of developing models. Cognition Labs\u2019 Devin, one of the best-performing agents for building and deploying software, only manages to get around a 14% success rate on a benchmark test measuring the ability to resolve issues on GitHub. There\u2019s clearly a lot of work to be done to reach the point where agents can juggle complex processes without oversight.\n\nEmergence has the capital to try \u2014 for now. But it might not in the future as VCs \u2014 and businesses \u2014 express increased skepticism in generative AI tech\u2019s path to ROI.\n\nNitta, projecting the confidence of someone whose startup just raised $100 million, asserted that Emergence is well-positioned for success.\n\n\u201cEmergence is resilient due to its focus on solving fundamental AI infrastructure problems that have a clear and immediate ROI for enterprises,\u201d he said. \u201cOur open-core business model, combined with premium services, ensures a steady revenue stream while fostering a growing community of developers and early adopters.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll see soon enough.", "authors": "['Kyle Wiggers']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nice-A1-Key-Alt-4.jpeg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/24/emergence-thinks-it-can-crack-the-ai-agent-code/", "timestamp": "1719366522.8099651", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "Silicon Valley leaders are once again declaring \u2018DEI\u2019 bad and \u2018meritocracy\u2019 good \u2014 but they\u2019re wrong", "text": "No, Silicon Valley, a \u2018meritocracy\u2019 is not better than DEI, according to the data\n\nWho\u2019s afraid of the Big Bad DEI? The acronym is near-poisonous now \u2014 a word that creates almost instant tension between those who embrace it and those who want it dead.\n\nA prime example of this divide was the response to startup Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang\u2019s post on X last week. He wrote about moving away from DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) to instead embrace \u201cMEI\u201d \u2014 merit, excellence, and intelligence.\n\n\u201cScale is a meritocracy, and we must always remain one,\u201d Wang wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal whenever we invite someone to join our mission, and those decisions have never been swayed by orthodoxy or virtue signaling or whatever the current thing is.\u201d\n\nToday we\u2019ve formalized an important hiring policy at Scale. We hire for MEI: merit, excellence, and intelligence.\n\n\n\nThis is the email I\u2019ve shared with our @scale_AI team.\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\nMERITOCRACY AT SCALE\n\n\n\nIn the wake of our fundraise, I\u2019ve been getting a lot of questions\u2026 \u2014 Alexandr Wang (@alexandr_wang) June 13, 2024\n\nThe commenters on X \u2014 which included Elon Musk, Palmer Luckey, and Brian Armstrong \u2014 were thrilled. On LinkedIn, however, the startup community gave a less-than-enthusiastic response. Those commenters pointed out that Wang\u2019s post made it seem as if \u201cmeritocracy\u201d was the definitive benchmark to find qualified hiring candidates \u2014 without taking into consideration that the idea of meritocracy is itself subjective. In the days that have followed the post, more and more people have shared their thoughts and what Wang\u2019s comments reveal about the current state of DEI in tech.\n\n\u201cThe post is misguided because people who support the meritocracy argument are ignoring the structural reasons some groups are more likely to outperform others,\u201d Mutale Nkonde, a founder working in AI policy, told TechCrunch. \u201dWe all want the best people for the job, and there is data to prove that diverse teams are more effective.\u201d\n\nEmily Witko, an HR professional at AI startup Hugging Face, told TechCrunch that the post was a \u201cdangerous oversimplification,\u201d but that it received so much attention on X because it \u201copenly expressed sentiments that are not always expressed publicly and the audience there is hungry to attack DEI.\u201d Wang\u2019s MEI thought \u201cmakes it so easy to refute or criticize any conversations regarding the importance of acknowledging underrepresentation in tech,\u201d she continued.\n\nBut Wang is far from the only Silicon Valley insider to attack DEI in recent months. He joins a chorus of those who feel that DEI programs implemented at businesses over the past several years, peaking with the Black Lives Matter movement, caused a backslide in corporate profitability \u2014 and that a return to \u201cmeritocratic principles\u201d is overdue. Indeed, much of the tech industry has worked to dismantle recruitment programs that considered candidates who, under previous hiring regimes, were often overlooked in the hiring process.\n\nSeeking to make a change, in 2020, many organizations and power players came together to promise more of a focus on DEI, which, contrary to the mainstream discussion, is not simply about hiring someone based on the color of their skin but is about ensuring qualified people from all walks of life \u2014 regardless of skin, gender, or ethnic background \u2014 are better represented and included in recruitment funnels. It\u2019s also about taking a look at disparities and pipeline issues, analyzing the reasoning behind why certain candidates are constantly overlooked in a hiring process.\n\nIn 2023, the U.S. data industry saw new women recruit levels drop by two-thirds, from 36% in 2022 to just 12%, according to a report from HR staffing firm Harnham. Meanwhile, the percentage of Black, Indigenous, and professionals of color in VP or above data roles stood at just 38% in 2022.\n\nAlexandr Wang (pictured above) caused a stir on social media when he posted about meritocracy in tech on X. Image Credits: Drew Angerer / Staff / Getty Images\n\nDEI-related job listings have also fallen out of favor, declining 44% in 2023, according to data from the job site Indeed. In the AI industry, a recent Deloitte survey of women found that over half said they ended up leaving at least one employer because of how men and women were treated differently, while 73% considered leaving the tech industry altogether due to unequal pay and an inability to advance in their careers.\n\nYet, for an industry that prides itself on being data-driven, Silicon Valley cannot let the idea of a meritocracy go \u2014 despite all the data and research showing how such thinking is just a belief system and one that can lead to biased outcomes. The idea of going out and hiring \u201cthe best person for the job\u201d without taking into account any human sociology is how pattern-matching occurs \u2014 teams and companies of people who are alike, when the research has long shown that more diverse teams perform better. Moreover, it has only raised suspicions about who the Valley considers excellent and why.\n\nExperts we spoke to said this subjectiveness revealed other issues with Wang\u2019s missive \u2014 mostly that he presents MEI as a revolutionary idea and not one that Silicon Valley and most of corporate America have long embraced. The acronym \u201cMEI\u201d appears to be a scornful nod to DEI, intended to drive home the notion that a company must choose between hiring diverse candidates or candidates that meet certain \u201cobjective\u201d qualifications.\n\nNatalie Sue Johnson, co-founder of the DEI consulting firm Paradigm, told TechCrunch that research has shown meritocracy to be a paradox and that organizations that focus too much on it actually see an increase in bias. \u201cIt frees people up from thinking that they have to try hard to be fair in their decision-making,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey think that meritocracy is inherent, not something that needs to be achieved.\u201d\n\nAs Nkonde mentioned, Johnson noted that Wang\u2019s approach doesn\u2019t acknowledge that underrepresented groups face systemic barriers society is still struggling to address. Ironically, the most meritorious person could be the one who has achieved a skill set for a job despite such barriers that may have influenced their educational background or prevented them from filling their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with the kind of college internships that impresses Silicon Valley.\n\nTreating a person as a faceless, nameless candidate, without understanding their unique experiences, and therefore their employability, is a mistake, Johnson said. \u201cThere is nuance.\u201d\n\nWitko added to that: \u201cA meritocratic system is built on criteria that reflect the status quo, and therefore, it will perpetuate existing inequalities by continuously favoring those who already have advantages.\u201d\n\nTo be somewhat charitable to Wang, given how acidic the term DEI has become, developing a new term that still represents the value of fairness to all candidates, isn\u2019t a terrible idea \u2014 even if \u201cmeritocracy\u201d is misguided.

{"title": "Silicon Valley leaders are once again declaring \u2018DEI\u2019 bad and \u2018meritocracy\u2019 good \u2014 but they\u2019re wrong", "text": "No, Silicon Valley, a \u2018meritocracy\u2019 is not better than DEI, according to the data\n\nWho\u2019s afraid of the Big Bad DEI? The acronym is near-poisonous now \u2014 a word that creates almost instant tension between those who embrace it and those who want it dead.\n\nA prime example of this divide was the response to startup Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang\u2019s post on X last week. He wrote about moving away from DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) to instead embrace \u201cMEI\u201d \u2014 merit, excellence, and intelligence.\n\n\u201cScale is a meritocracy, and we must always remain one,\u201d Wang wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal whenever we invite someone to join our mission, and those decisions have never been swayed by orthodoxy or virtue signaling or whatever the current thing is.\u201d\n\nToday we\u2019ve formalized an important hiring policy at Scale. We hire for MEI: merit, excellence, and intelligence.\n\n\n\nThis is the email I\u2019ve shared with our @scale_AI team.\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\nMERITOCRACY AT SCALE\n\n\n\nIn the wake of our fundraise, I\u2019ve been getting a lot of questions\u2026 \u2014 Alexandr Wang (@alexandr_wang) June 13, 2024\n\nThe commenters on X \u2014 which included Elon Musk, Palmer Luckey, and Brian Armstrong \u2014 were thrilled. On LinkedIn, however, the startup community gave a less-than-enthusiastic response. Those commenters pointed out that Wang\u2019s post made it seem as if \u201cmeritocracy\u201d was the definitive benchmark to find qualified hiring candidates \u2014 without taking into consideration that the idea of meritocracy is itself subjective. In the days that have followed the post, more and more people have shared their thoughts and what Wang\u2019s comments reveal about the current state of DEI in tech.\n\n\u201cThe post is misguided because people who support the meritocracy argument are ignoring the structural reasons some groups are more likely to outperform others,\u201d Mutale Nkonde, a founder working in AI policy, told TechCrunch. \u201dWe all want the best people for the job, and there is data to prove that diverse teams are more effective.\u201d\n\nEmily Witko, an HR professional at AI startup Hugging Face, told TechCrunch that the post was a \u201cdangerous oversimplification,\u201d but that it received so much attention on X because it \u201copenly expressed sentiments that are not always expressed publicly and the audience there is hungry to attack DEI.\u201d Wang\u2019s MEI thought \u201cmakes it so easy to refute or criticize any conversations regarding the importance of acknowledging underrepresentation in tech,\u201d she continued.\n\nBut Wang is far from the only Silicon Valley insider to attack DEI in recent months. He joins a chorus of those who feel that DEI programs implemented at businesses over the past several years, peaking with the Black Lives Matter movement, caused a backslide in corporate profitability \u2014 and that a return to \u201cmeritocratic principles\u201d is overdue. Indeed, much of the tech industry has worked to dismantle recruitment programs that considered candidates who, under previous hiring regimes, were often overlooked in the hiring process.\n\nSeeking to make a change, in 2020, many organizations and power players came together to promise more of a focus on DEI, which, contrary to the mainstream discussion, is not simply about hiring someone based on the color of their skin but is about ensuring qualified people from all walks of life \u2014 regardless of skin, gender, or ethnic background \u2014 are better represented and included in recruitment funnels. It\u2019s also about taking a look at disparities and pipeline issues, analyzing the reasoning behind why certain candidates are constantly overlooked in a hiring process.\n\nIn 2023, the U.S. data industry saw new women recruit levels drop by two-thirds, from 36% in 2022 to just 12%, according to a report from HR staffing firm Harnham. Meanwhile, the percentage of Black, Indigenous, and professionals of color in VP or above data roles stood at just 38% in 2022.\n\nAlexandr Wang (pictured above) caused a stir on social media when he posted about meritocracy in tech on X. Image Credits: Drew Angerer / Staff / Getty Images\n\nDEI-related job listings have also fallen out of favor, declining 44% in 2023, according to data from the job site Indeed. In the AI industry, a recent Deloitte survey of women found that over half said they ended up leaving at least one employer because of how men and women were treated differently, while 73% considered leaving the tech industry altogether due to unequal pay and an inability to advance in their careers.\n\nYet, for an industry that prides itself on being data-driven, Silicon Valley cannot let the idea of a meritocracy go \u2014 despite all the data and research showing how such thinking is just a belief system and one that can lead to biased outcomes. The idea of going out and hiring \u201cthe best person for the job\u201d without taking into account any human sociology is how pattern-matching occurs \u2014 teams and companies of people who are alike, when the research has long shown that more diverse teams perform better. Moreover, it has only raised suspicions about who the Valley considers excellent and why.\n\nExperts we spoke to said this subjectiveness revealed other issues with Wang\u2019s missive \u2014 mostly that he presents MEI as a revolutionary idea and not one that Silicon Valley and most of corporate America have long embraced. The acronym \u201cMEI\u201d appears to be a scornful nod to DEI, intended to drive home the notion that a company must choose between hiring diverse candidates or candidates that meet certain \u201cobjective\u201d qualifications.\n\nNatalie Sue Johnson, co-founder of the DEI consulting firm Paradigm, told TechCrunch that research has shown meritocracy to be a paradox and that organizations that focus too much on it actually see an increase in bias. \u201cIt frees people up from thinking that they have to try hard to be fair in their decision-making,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey think that meritocracy is inherent, not something that needs to be achieved.\u201d\n\nAs Nkonde mentioned, Johnson noted that Wang\u2019s approach doesn\u2019t acknowledge that underrepresented groups face systemic barriers society is still struggling to address. Ironically, the most meritorious person could be the one who has achieved a skill set for a job despite such barriers that may have influenced their educational background or prevented them from filling their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with the kind of college internships that impresses Silicon Valley.\n\nTreating a person as a faceless, nameless candidate, without understanding their unique experiences, and therefore their employability, is a mistake, Johnson said. \u201cThere is nuance.\u201d\n\nWitko added to that: \u201cA meritocratic system is built on criteria that reflect the status quo, and therefore, it will perpetuate existing inequalities by continuously favoring those who already have advantages.\u201d\n\nTo be somewhat charitable to Wang, given how acidic the term DEI has become, developing a new term that still represents the value of fairness to all candidates, isn\u2019t a terrible idea \u2014 even if \u201cmeritocracy\u201d is misguided. And his post suggests that Scale AI\u2019s values could align with the spirit of diversity, equity, and inclusion even if he might not realize it, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cCasting a wide net for talent and making objective hiring decisions that do not disadvantage candidates based on identity is exactly what diversity, equity, and inclusion work seeks to do,\u201d she explained.\n\nBut again, where Wang undermines this is endorsing the mistaken belief that meritocracy will produce outcomes based on one\u2019s abilities and merits alone.\n\nPerhaps it is all a paradox.

Fitzgerald will head off to Duke in the fall and Van Landschoot will move near the university but is putting his college plans on hold to be a full-time startup founder.\n\nThe money was raised while they were still in high school after a prototype for their idea garnered a lot of interest among the large Boulder community of AI enthusiasts.\n\nAPIGen is working on a platform that will build custom APIs from natural language prompts. It will be able to, for instance, allow an e-commerce business to simply ask for an API that connects its web front end to its database, and the platform will deliver it.\n\nBy API, the founders don\u2019t just mean a standard \u201capplication programming interface\u201d that allows applications to exchange data or perform some other simple workflow function. They want APIGen to create complex custom APIs that can do multiple or serial tasks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually generating the code for the APIs so that you can have business logic, actual custom functionalities within those APIs as well,\u201d Van Landschoot told TechCrunch.\n\nIn addition to web apps and databases, Fitzgerald says IoT devices are one of his startup\u2019s target areas. He offers the example of a customer asking for an API that instructs a drone to fly around the perimeter of an area, capture images and allow another application to interface with the result. Another example is an API that uses face recognition for building security. Once a database of photos of verified employee faces is created, the user could ask APIGen for an API that lets a smartlock\u2019s door camera check the face of everyone who arrives against that database before unlocking the door.\n\n\u201cAPIs at the end of the day, can be as simple or as complex as you make them to be,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cThey can range from just new connectors that take one entry of data, one row of data from a table of a database, to entire back ends. And that\u2019s really what we\u2019re trying to target there, for entire web apps for entire IoT applications.\u201d\n\nThe teens met on their school\u2019s debate team and bonded over their love of coding. Their first project together was a chatbot that would allow people to chat with data. They soon realized that it wasn\u2019t an original idea. Still, while building that app, they learned that their tech relied on APIs and that \u201cmaking APIs was kind of a pain,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cThey were hard to design.\u201d\n\nSo they focused on that. Once they crafted an alpha version of their idea, a demo-level tool, they began to show it around to the programmers in their circle to get feedback. They knew people in their local tech industry. Van Landschoot\u2019s dad works in cybersecurity IT, and Fitzgerald landed a summer internship at SoftBank through a connection with a friend\u2019s dad.\n\nAnd then they started sending cold messages to VCs on LinkedIn and to anyone else they thought might respond.\n\n\u201cWe asked people to destroy this pitch deck,\u201d Fitzgerald said.\n\nPhil Broenniman (left), Ankur Ahuja (right), Varana Capital Image Credits: Varana Capital\n\nA VC is so impressed, he offers to invest\n\nOne of the people who got the message \u2014 and had heard about the founders through other connections in Denver/Boulder\u2019s tight-knit startup community \u2014 was Philip Broenniman, founder of Denver\u2019s Varana Capital. Varana began as a family office for Broenniman and a partner 13 years ago, and has since expanded into a firm with institutional LP money and $400 million in AUM, he told TechCrunch\n\nBroenniman and Varana COO Ankur Ahuja agreed to meet with the teens. \u201cWe went into the meeting thinking we were going to provide some fatherly, avuncular advice; provide some words of wisdom,\u201d Broenniman told TechCrunch. \u201cWe walked out after two hours of their presentation thinking that this was the best presentation we had heard in the last five years. We were blown away by the cogent insights these two 18-year-olds gave.\u201d\n\nWith Fitzgerald dressed in his best sweater and Van Landschoot in a debate-team-style collared shirt, they leaned into their debate training and pitched their company, their vision, the potential market and themselves.\n\nRather than feedback on the pitch, \u201cAt the end of the meeting, they mentioned that they were actually interested,\u201d Fitzgerald said of the Varana partners. Broenniman asked the teens how much money they were looking for.\n\nVarana did its diligence looking into the potential of the API market, which has created multibillion dollars\u2019 worth of successes (MuleSoft bought by Salesforce, Apigee bought by Google, to name just two). And it looked at the founders\u2019 backgrounds: Fitzgerald graduated as valedictorian of a top-ranked high school in Boulder, which has a highly ranked public education system; Van Landschoot was such a gifted programmer that he had been tutoring college computer science students since he was 14.\n\nThe Varana partners scheduled a second meeting for the founders to demo their tech to make sure the teens weren\u2019t just \u201cgood at talking but not delivering and doing stuff,\u201d as Van Landschoot described.\n\nThe teens were nervous, they confessed, but the demo went well and the VC offered a term sheet: $250,000 of pre-seed money with another $250,000 in a SAFE, which is a note that converts to equity if the startup raises later. The VC also provided office space.\n\nWhile they were pitching to the VCs, Fitzgerald learned about Boulder\u2019s active AI Meetup that has 1,400 members, organized by a dad of one of Fitzgerald\u2019s tennis team teammates. Boulder has a famously close and cozy startup community and, along with nearby Denver, hosts office outposts for Amazon, IBM, Google, Microsoft and many others.\n\nThe teens joined the group and demoed their product, and the local AI enthusiasts rallied behind them and their idea.\n\nAPIGen is obviously very early. And it isn\u2019t the only one working on automating APIs. Giant tech companies like Salesforce\u2019s MuleSoft and established startups like RapidAPI are already working on this market, as are most of the cloud giants.\n\nAPIGen also doesn\u2019t yet have its minimum viable product built, though it\u2019s getting closer with a beta version that will be released this month. \u201cWe\u2019ve already had some interest from businesses, but obviously we\u2019re still pre-MVP at this stage, and just cranking, trying to get it out as soon as possible,\u201d Fitzgerald said.\n\nStill, Broenniman, who takes board seats with investments, is in for the ride. He points to how the young founders have already built a community of eager supporters.\n\n\u201cAPIGen may be the vehicle into which we\u2019re making an investment, but we\u2019re creating partnership with Christopher and Nicholas,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a $7 billion-plus market.

The company is currently focused on growth, Xu said, but has plans for how to monetize in the future.\n\n\u201cMonday to Friday, 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. is the game,\u201d Xu said. \u201cWhen we started, I was so scared that it would be quiet on the weekends, but on Monday, people just come back.

The trajectory of this space reminds me a lot of the crypto world. While very different, they are both investing areas that had their 15 minutes of fame, but as they faded from the mainstream, they still kept dedicated and growing communities of people interested in their approach.\n\nStill, AfterHour is an especially smart idea because, as with crypto, there is much money to be made here \u2014 and just as much to lose. Such platforms can\u2019t guarantee their users will find financial success, but that doesn\u2019t mean average people should be fully locked out of the stock markets, which companies like Robinhood, and more recently Destiney Tech 100, have worked to democratize.\n\n\u201cThe big misconception in the valley was that retail trading was a fad in 2021, referencing the stimulus check,\u201d Xu said. \u201cIt\u2019s only growing.

Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday.\n\nElon Musk just convinced Tesla shareholders to approve his $56 billion pay package, making him the highest-paid CEO in history \u2014 assuming he can dodge a Delaware judge\u2019s disapproval. And where better to stage this circus than Texas, home of big everything, including egos? Shareholders erupted in applause at Tesla\u2019s Texas gigafactory when the vote results were announced. Meanwhile, Musk juggles more companies than a clown with chainsaws and faces two new lawsuits (being sued just once per week is for wimps). Oh, and forget about any fancy ESG initiatives; those got shot down faster than you can say \u201ccorporate responsibility.\u201d Who needs sustainability when you\u2019ve got Elon dancing onstage with 0.7 Twitter\u2019s worth of cash in a suitcase?\n\nMost interesting startup stories from the week\n\nIt seems Henrik Fisker\u2019s knack for designing cars is only matched by his talent for driving companies into bankruptcy. Despite aiming to be the Apple of EVs (with Magna playing Foxconn), the much-touted Ocean SUV sank faster than the Titanic with software glitches, recalls, and lemon lawsuits galore. Now filing for Chapter 11 in Delaware, Fisker has gone from dreams of revolutionizing the auto industry to just trying not to get stuck with a $500 million bill. This marks Fisker\u2019s second go of bankrupting an eponymous company. Can he make it to three? Stay tuned.\n\nYeah, saw that one coming : Ever feel like your subscription services are plotting against you?

Image Credits: Adobe\n\nTrend of the week: All eyes on AI\n\nApple has finally thrown its hat into the AI icon circus, joining the likes of Google and OpenAI in a desperate bid to depict AI with a logo that makes any sense at all. Spoiler alert: They\u2019re as clueless as everyone else. Apple\u2019s new visual for \u201cIntelligence\u201d is essentially a psychedelic circle \u2014 wait, no \u2014 a lopsided infinity symbol? Actually, it\u2019s New Siri. Or maybe it\u2019s when your phone edges glow like an alien spaceship landing. The real takeaway here? No one knows what AI should look like, but let\u2019s slap on some friendly pastel colors and call it innovation.\n\nMeanwhile, Ilya Sutskever, the AI brainiac who last month decided OpenAI wasn\u2019t exciting enough anymore, has started his own shindig called Safe Superintelligence Inc. (SSI) with a couple of other ex-OpenAI pals. After a dramatic exit from OpenAI (presumably over how to avoid Skynet taking over), Sutskever is doubling down on making sure super-smart AI doesn\u2019t become our overlord anytime soon. SSI\u2019s mission? To balance mind-blowing AI advancements with safety measures so we don\u2019t end up starring in our very own \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d episode.\n\nSure, that seems AI-y, doesn\u2019t it?

{"title": "Khosla-backed Marble, built by former Headway founders, offers affordable group therapy for teens", "text": "Rates of depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts are surging among U.S. teens.\n\nA recent report from the Center of Disease Control found that nearly one in three girls have seriously considered suicide, and a significant number, 13% have actually attempted it.\n\nPsychologists have various theories about what\u2019s causing adolescent mental health crises.\n\nSome blame the increased use of smartphones and social media, while others believe that the isolation during the pandemic has played a significant role.\n\nWhile the primary drivers of teen psychological difficulties are not well understood, the bigger challenge now is finding ways to solve the growing problem, given a nationwide shortage of mental health professionals.\n\nJake Sussman, who was one of the four co-founders of unicorn-size mental health network Headway, believes his new startup can help address the deepening crisis by offering online group therapy for children in grades five through 12.\n\nAfter leaving Headway two years ago, Sussman decided to try something entirely different. He became a fifth-grade English teacher at a charter school in Brooklyn. That experience not only gave him an opportunity to teach kids how to write essays but also gave him a front-row seat to why the mental health care for children is currently broken.\n\nSussman\u2019s school had one counselor, but despite that person\u2019s best effort, they often couldn\u2019t arrange timely help for students, he said.\n\n\u201c[Counselors] are not clinicians. They have massive caseloads,\u201d Sussman said. \u201cThe best they can do is give families physical PDFs of clinics that all have long wait lists.\u201d\n\nHe shared the story of Jamelia, an orphan who became depressed after her best friend left the school.

{"title": "Khosla-backed Marble, built by former Headway founders, offers affordable group therapy for teens", "text": "Rates of depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts are surging among U.S. teens.\n\nA recent report from the Center of Disease Control found that nearly one in three girls have seriously considered suicide, and a significant number, 13% have actually attempted it.\n\nPsychologists have various theories about what\u2019s causing adolescent mental health crises.\n\nSome blame the increased use of smartphones and social media, while others believe that the isolation during the pandemic has played a significant role.\n\nWhile the primary drivers of teen psychological difficulties are not well understood, the bigger challenge now is finding ways to solve the growing problem, given a nationwide shortage of mental health professionals.\n\nJake Sussman, who was one of the four co-founders of unicorn-size mental health network Headway, believes his new startup can help address the deepening crisis by offering online group therapy for children in grades five through 12.\n\nAfter leaving Headway two years ago, Sussman decided to try something entirely different. He became a fifth-grade English teacher at a charter school in Brooklyn. That experience not only gave him an opportunity to teach kids how to write essays but also gave him a front-row seat to why the mental health care for children is currently broken.\n\nSussman\u2019s school had one counselor, but despite that person\u2019s best effort, they often couldn\u2019t arrange timely help for students, he said.\n\n\u201c[Counselors] are not clinicians. They have massive caseloads,\u201d Sussman said. \u201cThe best they can do is give families physical PDFs of clinics that all have long wait lists.\u201d\n\nHe shared the story of Jamelia, an orphan who became depressed after her best friend left the school. Because Jamelia was covered by Medicaid, she had to wait three months to see a therapist.\n\nSussman realized that one way to solve the mental health professional shortage is to offer help in a group setting.\n\n\u201cGroup care has been around for a long time,\u201d Sussman said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been studied rigorously.

{"title": "Apple\u2019s App Store breaches EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act", "text": "A few months after opening a non-compliance case on Apple and the Digital Markets Act (DMA), the European Commission has shared its preliminary findings with Apple. And the bottom line is that the current App Store rules are in breach of the DMA. Confirmed violations of the DMA can lead to fines of up to 10% of global annual turnover.\n\n\u201c\u2018Act different\u2019 should be their new slogan,\u201d the EU\u2019s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, wrote on X. \u201cFor too long, Apple has been squeezing out innovative companies \u2014 denying consumers new opportunities & choices.\u201d\n\nIn this particular case, the European Commission believes third-party developers should be able to inform customers of alternative purchasing possibilities \u2014 free of charge.\n\nFor instance, developers who have released apps on the App Store can\u2019t advertise different prices or alternative distribution channels in their apps. While Apple now allows developers to include a link to their site, the European Commission believes there are too many restrictions with this link-out mechanism.\n\nEven if developers redirect users to their websites and handle transactions on their websites, they have to report transactions to Apple and pay a commission. Apple only waives a 3% payment processing fee for web purchases.\n\n\u201cApple has made a number of changes to comply with the DMA in response to feedback from developers and the European Commission,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe are confident our plan complies with the law, and estimate more than 99% of developers would pay the same or less in fees to Apple under the new business terms we created.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these preliminary findings, the European Commission is opening a third non-compliance investigation into Apple\u2019s new contractual terms for EU developers. This time, the Commission is going to focus on Apple\u2019s controversial Core Technology Fee (CTF) and alternative app marketplaces.\n\nEuropean developers can remain on the standard business terms or choose new business terms that allow them to distribute their apps outside of the App Store. However, these new terms lead to a \u20ac0.50 fee per installed app after one million downloads.\n\nThe company has already adjusted the CTF so that it doesn\u2019t apply to free non-commercial apps. There\u2019s also a three-year transition period for small developers that release a hit app and get more than one million downloads for the first time. But that doesn\u2019t change much in the long term. With this new formal investigation, the EC will determine whether the CTF effectively complies with the DMA.\n\nIf you\u2019ve tried to install a third-party app store in the EU, such as the AltStore, Setapp Mobile or Aptoide, you may have noticed that it requires quite a few taps. You first get an error in your web browser. You have to open the Settings app, accept app installations from this site, go back to your web browser, download the alternative store again, and accept popups about the risks involved with a third-party app store. The EC will examine this \u201cmulti-step user journey\u201d and its compliance with the DMA rules.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that Apple designed its new business model to discourage app developers and end users from taking advantage of the opportunities afforded to them by the DMA,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, the Commission EVP in charge of competition policy, said in a speech.\n\n\u201cThe letter of the DMA is clear: Gatekeepers have to allow for alternative app stores to establish themselves on their platform, and for consumers to be fully informed about the offers available to them so that they can freely choose where they want to source their apps, and at what conditions,\u201d she added.\n\nAs for today\u2019s preliminary findings, Apple can now respond to the European Commission in writing. The final decision is due one year after the opening of the formal investigation, which means that Apple can negotiate with the EU and adjust its business terms once again to avoid a hefty fine.", "authors": "['Romain Dillet']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2112138706.jpg?resize=1200,795", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/24/apples-app-store-breaches-eus-digital-markets-act/", "timestamp": "1719366620.102721", "displayed": 0}
{"title": "Silicon Valley leaders are once again declaring \u2018DEI\u2019 bad and \u2018meritocracy\u2019 good \u2014 but they\u2019re wrong", "text": "No, Silicon Valley, a \u2018meritocracy\u2019 is not better than DEI, according to the data\n\nWho\u2019s afraid of the Big Bad DEI? The acronym is near-poisonous now \u2014 a word that creates almost instant tension between those who embrace it and those who want it dead.\n\nA prime example of this divide was the response to startup Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang\u2019s post on X last week. He wrote about moving away from DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) to instead embrace \u201cMEI\u201d \u2014 merit, excellence, and intelligence.\n\n\u201cScale is a meritocracy, and we must always remain one,\u201d Wang wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal whenever we invite someone to join our mission, and those decisions have never been swayed by orthodoxy or virtue signaling or whatever the current thing is.\u201d\n\nToday we\u2019ve formalized an important hiring policy at Scale. We hire for MEI: merit, excellence, and intelligence.\n\n\n\nThis is the email I\u2019ve shared with our @scale_AI team.\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\nMERITOCRACY AT SCALE\n\n\n\nIn the wake of our fundraise, I\u2019ve been getting a lot of questions\u2026 \u2014 Alexandr Wang (@alexandr_wang) June 13, 2024\n\nThe commenters on X \u2014 which included Elon Musk, Palmer Luckey, and Brian Armstrong \u2014 were thrilled. On LinkedIn, however, the startup community gave a less-than-enthusiastic response. Those commenters pointed out that Wang\u2019s post made it seem as if \u201cmeritocracy\u201d was the definitive benchmark to find qualified hiring candidates \u2014 without taking into consideration that the idea of meritocracy is itself subjective. In the days that have followed the post, more and more people have shared their thoughts and what Wang\u2019s comments reveal about the current state of DEI in tech.\n\n\u201cThe post is misguided because people who support the meritocracy argument are ignoring the structural reasons some groups are more likely to outperform others,\u201d Mutale Nkonde, a founder working in AI policy, told TechCrunch. \u201dWe all want the best people for the job, and there is data to prove that diverse teams are more effective.\u201d\n\nEmily Witko, an HR professional at AI startup Hugging Face, told TechCrunch that the post was a \u201cdangerous oversimplification,\u201d but that it received so much attention on X because it \u201copenly expressed sentiments that are not always expressed publicly and the audience there is hungry to attack DEI.\u201d Wang\u2019s MEI thought \u201cmakes it so easy to refute or criticize any conversations regarding the importance of acknowledging underrepresentation in tech,\u201d she continued.\n\nBut Wang is far from the only Silicon Valley insider to attack DEI in recent months. He joins a chorus of those who feel that DEI programs implemented at businesses over the past several years, peaking with the Black Lives Matter movement, caused a backslide in corporate profitability \u2014 and that a return to \u201cmeritocratic principles\u201d is overdue. Indeed, much of the tech industry has worked to dismantle recruitment programs that considered candidates who, under previous hiring regimes, were often overlooked in the hiring process.\n\nSeeking to make a change, in 2020, many organizations and power players came together to promise more of a focus on DEI, which, contrary to the mainstream discussion, is not simply about hiring someone based on the color of their skin but is about ensuring qualified people from all walks of life \u2014 regardless of skin, gender, or ethnic background \u2014 are better represented and included in recruitment funnels. It\u2019s also about taking a look at disparities and pipeline issues, analyzing the reasoning behind why certain candidates are constantly overlooked in a hiring process.\n\nIn 2023, the U.S. data industry saw new women recruit levels drop by two-thirds, from 36% in 2022 to just 12%, according to a report from HR staffing firm Harnham. Meanwhile, the percentage of Black, Indigenous, and professionals of color in VP or above data roles stood at just 38% in 2022.\n\nAlexandr Wang (pictured above) caused a stir on social media when he posted about meritocracy in tech on X. Image Credits: Drew Angerer / Staff / Getty Images\n\nDEI-related job listings have also fallen out of favor, declining 44% in 2023, according to data from the job site Indeed. In the AI industry, a recent Deloitte survey of women found that over half said they ended up leaving at least one employer because of how men and women were treated differently, while 73% considered leaving the tech industry altogether due to unequal pay and an inability to advance in their careers.\n\nYet, for an industry that prides itself on being data-driven, Silicon Valley cannot let the idea of a meritocracy go \u2014 despite all the data and research showing how such thinking is just a belief system and one that can lead to biased outcomes. The idea of going out and hiring \u201cthe best person for the job\u201d without taking into account any human sociology is how pattern-matching occurs \u2014 teams and companies of people who are alike, when the research has long shown that more diverse teams perform better. Moreover, it has only raised suspicions about who the Valley considers excellent and why.\n\nExperts we spoke to said this subjectiveness revealed other issues with Wang\u2019s missive \u2014 mostly that he presents MEI as a revolutionary idea and not one that Silicon Valley and most of corporate America have long embraced. The acronym \u201cMEI\u201d appears to be a scornful nod to DEI, intended to drive home the notion that a company must choose between hiring diverse candidates or candidates that meet certain \u201cobjective\u201d qualifications.\n\nNatalie Sue Johnson, co-founder of the DEI consulting firm Paradigm, told TechCrunch that research has shown meritocracy to be a paradox and that organizations that focus too much on it actually see an increase in bias. \u201cIt frees people up from thinking that they have to try hard to be fair in their decision-making,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey think that meritocracy is inherent, not something that needs to be achieved.\u201d\n\nAs Nkonde mentioned, Johnson noted that Wang\u2019s approach doesn\u2019t acknowledge that underrepresented groups face systemic barriers society is still struggling to address. Ironically, the most meritorious person could be the one who has achieved a skill set for a job despite such barriers that may have influenced their educational background or prevented them from filling their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with the kind of college internships that impresses Silicon Valley.\n\nTreating a person as a faceless, nameless candidate, without understanding their unique experiences, and therefore their employability, is a mistake, Johnson said. \u201cThere is nuance.\u201d\n\nWitko added to that: \u201cA meritocratic system is built on criteria that reflect the status quo, and therefore, it will perpetuate existing inequalities by continuously favoring those who already have advantages.\u201d\n\nTo be somewhat charitable to Wang, given how acidic the term DEI has become, developing a new term that still represents the value of fairness to all candidates, isn\u2019t a terrible idea \u2014 even if \u201cmeritocracy\u201d is misguided. And his post suggests that Scale AI\u2019s values could align with the spirit of diversity, equity, and inclusion even if he might not realize it, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cCasting a wide net for talent and making objective hiring decisions that do not disadvantage candidates based on identity is exactly what diversity, equity, and inclusion work seeks to do,\u201d she explained.\n\nBut again, where Wang undermines this is endorsing the mistaken belief that meritocracy will produce outcomes based on one\u2019s abilities and merits alone.\n\nPerhaps it is all a paradox. If one looks at Scale AI\u2019s treatment of its data annotators \u2014 many of whom live in economically depressed countries and scrape by on little pay \u2014 it suggests the company has scant real interest in disrupting the status quo.\n\nScale AI\u2019s annotators work on tasks for multiple eight-hour workdays \u2014 no breaks \u2014 for pay ranging as low as $10 (per the Verge and NY Mag). It\u2019s on the backs of these annotators that Scale AI has built a business worth over $13 billion and with more than $1.6 billion in cash in the bank.\n\nWhen asked for comment on the allegations made in the Verge and NY Mag piece, a spokesperson pointed to this blog post, in which it described its human annotator jobs as \u201cgig work.\u201d The spokesperson didn\u2019t address TechCrunch\u2019s request for clarification on Scale AI\u2019s MEI policy.\n\nJohnson said Wang\u2019s post is a great example of the box many leaders and companies find themselves trapped in.\n\nShe pondered, can they trust that having meritocratic ideals is enough to lead to truly meritocratic outcomes, and promote diversity?\n\n\u201cOr,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cdo they acknowledge that ideals are not enough, and to truly build more diverse workforces where everyone has the same access to opportunities and can do their best work requires intention?\u201d", "authors": "['Dominic-Madori Davis', 'Kyle Wiggers']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DEI-big-bad-wolf.jpg?resize=1200,645", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/23/silicon-valley-leaders-are-once-again-declaring-dei-bad-and-meritocracy-good-but-theyre-wrong/", "timestamp": "1719366621.491694", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "iOS 18 could \u2018sherlock\u2019 $400M in app revenue", "text": "Apple\u2019s practice of leveraging ideas from its third-party developer community to become new iOS and Mac features and apps has a hefty price tag, a new report indicates. With the release of iOS 18 later this fall, Apple\u2019s changes may affect apps that today have an estimated $393 million in revenue and have been downloaded roughly 58 million times over the past year, according to an analysis by app intelligence firm Appfigures.\n\nEvery June at Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference, the iPhone maker teases the upcoming releases of its software and operating systems, which often include features previously only available through third-party apps. The practice is so common now it\u2019s even been given a name: \u201csherlocking\u201d \u2014 a reference to a 1990s search app for Mac that borrowed features from a third-party app known as Watson. Now when Apple launches a new feature that was before the domain of a third-party app, it\u2019s said to have \u201csherlocked\u201d the app.\n\nIn earlier years, sherlocking apps made some sense. After all, did the iPhone\u2019s flashlight really need to be a third-party offering, or would it be better as a built-in function? Plus, Apple has been able to launch features that made its software better adapted to consumers\u2019 wants and needs by looking at what\u2019s popular among the third-party developer community.\n\nOf course, this practice also raises the question as to whether Apple is leveraging proprietary data to make its determinations about what to build next, and whether the apps it competes with are being offered an even playing field. For example, before Apple launched its own parental controls system, it shut down many third-party apps that had built businesses in this space by saying their solutions were now noncompliant with its rules and policies. The apps weren\u2019t offered access to a developer API for managing Apple\u2019s built-in parental controls for years, prompting an antitrust investigation.\n\nIn more recent years, Apple has \u201csherlocked\u201d third parties with launches of features like Continuity Camera, medication tracking, sleep tracking and mood tracking, as well as apps like Freeform and Journal. This year, it turned its attention to password managers, call recording and transcription apps, those for making custom emoji, AI-powered writing tools and math helpers, trail apps and more.\n\nIn an analysis of third-party apps that generated more than 1,000 downloads per year, Appfigures discovered several genres that had found themselves in Apple\u2019s crosshairs in 2024.\n\nIn terms of worldwide gross revenue, these categories have generated significant income over the past 12 months, with the trail app category making the most at $307 million per year, led by market leader and 2023 Apple \u201cApp of the Year\u201d AllTrails. Grammar helper apps, like Grammarly and others, also generated $35.7 million, while math helpers and password managers earned $23.4 million and $20.3 million, respectively. Apps for making custom emoji generated $7 million, too.\n\nImage Credits: Appfigures\n\nOf these, trail apps accounted for the vast majority of \u201cpotentially sherlocked\u201d revenue, or 78%, noted Appfigures, as well as 40% of downloads of sherlocked apps. In May 2024, they accounted for an estimated $28.8 million in gross consumer spending and 2.5 million downloads, to give you an idea of scale.\n\nMany of these app categories were growing quickly, with math solvers having seen revenue growth of 43% year-over-year followed by grammar helpers (+40%), password managers (+38%) and trail apps (+28%). Emoji-making apps, however, were seeing declines at -17% year-over-year.\n\nImage Credits: Appfigures\n\nBy downloads, grammar helpers had seen 9.4 million installs over the past 12 months, followed by emoji makers (10.6 million), math-solving apps (9.5 million) and password managers (457,000 installs).\n\nAlthough these apps certainly have dedicated user bases that may not immediately choose to switch to a first-party offering, Apple\u2019s ability to offer similar functionality built-in could be detrimental to their potential growth. Casual users may be satisfied by Apple\u2019s \u201cgood enough\u201d solutions and won\u2019t seek out alternatives.\n\nHowever, apps that continue to develop new features and add enhancements beyond what Apple includes while also taking advantage of other new ways to reach users, like through Apple\u2019s improved Siri, may have a better shot than others.", "authors": "['Sarah Perez']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/app-store-2024-v1.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/18/ios-18-could-sherlock-400m-in-app-revenue/", "timestamp": "1719366624.314452", "displayed": 0}

The goal is to have the new tool in place and ready to use by 2025.\n\nOpenAI explores allowing AI porn\n\nIn a new peek behind the curtain of its AI\u2019s secret instructions, OpenAI also released a new NSFW policy. Though it\u2019s intended to start a conversation about how it might allow explicit images and text in its AI products, it raises questions about whether OpenAI \u2014 or any generative AI vendor \u2014 can be trusted to handle sensitive content ethically.\n\nOpenAI and Stack Overflow announce partnership\n\nIn a new partnership, OpenAI will get access to developer platform Stack Overflow\u2019s API and will get feedback from developers to improve the performance of their AI models. In return, OpenAI will include attributions to Stack Overflow in ChatGPT. However, the deal was not favorable to some Stack Overflow users \u2014 leading to some sabotaging their answer in protest.\n\nApril 2024\n\nU.S. newspapers file copyright lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft\n\nAlden Global Capital-owned newspapers, including the New York Daily News, the Chicago Tribune, and the Denver Post, are suing OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement. The lawsuit alleges that the companies stole millions of copyrighted articles \u201cwithout permission and without payment\u201d to bolster ChatGPT and Copilot.\n\nOpenAI inks content licensing deal with Financial Times\n\nOpenAI has partnered with another news publisher in Europe, London\u2019s Financial Times, that the company will be paying for content access. \u201cThrough the partnership, ChatGPT users will be able to see select attributed summaries, quotes and rich links to FT journalism in response to relevant queries,\u201d the FT wrote in a press release.\n\nOpenAI opens Tokyo hub, adds GPT-4 model optimized for Japanese\n\nOpenAI is opening a new office in Tokyo and has plans for a GPT-4 model optimized specifically for the Japanese language.

You won\u2019t be able to save or share chats, use custom instructions, or other features associated with a persistent account. This version of ChatGPT will have \u201cslightly more restrictive content policies,\u201d according to OpenAI. When TechCrunch asked for more details, however, the response was unclear:\n\n\u201cThe signed out experience will benefit from the existing safety mitigations that are already built into the model, such as refusing to generate harmful content. In addition to these existing mitigations, we are also implementing additional safeguards specifically designed to address other forms of content that may be inappropriate for a signed out experience,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\nMarch 2024\n\nOpenAI\u2019s chatbot store is filling up with spam\n\nTechCrunch found that the OpenAI\u2019s GPT Store is flooded with bizarre, potentially copyright-infringing GPTs. A cursory search pulls up GPTs that claim to generate art in the style of Disney and Marvel properties, but serve as little more than funnels to third-party paid services and advertise themselves as being able to bypass AI content detection tools.\n\nThe New York Times responds to OpenAI\u2019s claims that it \u201chacked\u201d ChatGPT for its copyright lawsuit\n\nIn a court filing opposing OpenAI\u2019s motion to dismiss The New York Times\u2019 lawsuit alleging copyright infringement, the newspaper asserted that \u201cOpenAI\u2019s attention-grabbing claim that The Times \u2018hacked\u2019 its products is as irrelevant as it is false.\u201d The New York Times also claimed that some users of ChatGPT used the tool to bypass its paywalls.\n\nOpenAI VP doesn\u2019t say whether artists should be paid for training data\n\nAt a SXSW 2024 panel, Peter Deng, OpenAI\u2019s VP of consumer product dodged a question on whether artists whose work was used to train generative AI models should be compensated. While OpenAI lets artists \u201copt out\u201d of and remove their work from the datasets that the company uses to train its image-generating models, some artists have described the tool as onerous.\n\nA new report estimates that ChatGPT uses more than half a million kilowatt-hours of electricity per day\n\nChatGPT\u2019s environmental impact appears to be massive. According to a report from The New Yorker, ChatGPT uses an estimated 17,000 times the amount of electricity than the average U.S. household to respond to roughly 200 million requests each day.\n\nChatGPT can now read its answers aloud\n\nOpenAI released a new Read Aloud feature for the web version of ChatGPT as well as the iOS and Android apps.

How does it work?\n\nChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.\n\nWhen did ChatGPT get released?\n\nNovember 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.\n\nWhat is the latest version of ChatGPT?\n\nBoth the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.\n\nCan I use ChatGPT for free?\n\nThere is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.\n\nWho uses ChatGPT?\n\nAnyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.\n\nWhat companies use ChatGPT?\n\nMultiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.\n\nMost recently, Microsoft announced at it\u2019s 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.\n\nWhat does GPT mean in ChatGPT?\n\nGPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.\n\nWhat is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?\n\nA chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they\u2019ll give canned responses to questions.\n\nChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.\n\nCan ChatGPT write essays?\n\nYes.\n\nCan ChatGPT commit libel?\n\nDue to the nature of how these models work, they don\u2019t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That\u2019s a problem when you\u2019re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn\u2019t commit, that may well at this point be libel.\n\nWe will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.\n\nDoes ChatGPT have an app?\n\nYes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.\n\nWhat is the ChatGPT character limit?\n\nIt\u2019s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.\n\nDoes ChatGPT have an API?\n\nYes, it was released March 1, 2023.\n\nWhat are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?\n\nEveryday examples include programing, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.\n\nWhat are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?\n\nAdvanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.\n\nHow good is ChatGPT at writing code?\n\nIt depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can\u2019t necessarily program an entire app\u2019s worth of code. That\u2019s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness \u2014 in other words, the generated code isn\u2019t always appropriate for the specific context in which it\u2019s being used.\n\nCan you save a ChatGPT chat?\n\nYes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.\n\nAre there alternatives to ChatGPT?\n\nYes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google\u2019s Gemini and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.\n\nHow does ChatGPT handle data privacy?\n\nOpenAI has said that individuals in \u201ccertain jurisdictions\u201d (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression \u201cin accordance with applicable laws\u201d.\n\nThe web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled \u201cOpenAI Personal Data Removal Request\u201d.\n\nIn its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on \u201clegitimate interest\u201d (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out \u2014 when it writes: \u201cSee here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.\u201d\n\nWhat controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?\n\nRecently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI\u2019s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.\n\nAn Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT\u2019s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.\n\nCNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.\n\nSeveral major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.\n\nThere have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.\n\nWhere can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?\n\nSeveral marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.\n\nCan ChatGPT be detected?\n\nPoorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they\u2019re inconsistent at best.\n\nAre ChatGPT chats public?\n\nNo. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users\u2019 conversations to other people on the service.\n\nWhat lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?\n\nNone specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.\n\nAre there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?\n\nYes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.", "authors": "['Kyle Wiggers', 'Cody Corrall', 'Alyssa Stringer']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1462188043.jpg?resize=1200,798", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/17/chatgpt-everything-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot/", "timestamp": "1719366629.4495091", "displayed": 0}
{"title": "Perplexity Is a Bullshit Machine", "text": "Considering Perplexity\u2019s bold ambition and the investment it\u2019s taken from Jeff Bezos\u2019 family fund, Nvidia, and famed investor Balaji Srinivasan, among others, it\u2019s surprisingly unclear what the AI search startup actually is.\n\nEarlier this year, speaking to WIRED, Aravind Srinivas, Perplexity\u2019s CEO, described his product\u2014a chatbot that gives natural-language answers to prompts and can, the company says, access the internet in real time\u2014as an \u201canswer engine.\u201d A few weeks later, shortly before a funding round valuing the company at a billion dollars was announced, he told Forbes, \u201cIt\u2019s almost like Wikipedia and ChatGPT had a kid.\u201d More recently, after Forbes accused Perplexity of plagiarizing its content, Srinivas told the AP it was a mere \u201caggregator of information.\u201d\n\nThe Perplexity chatbot itself is more specific. Prompted to describe what Perplexity is, it provides text that reads, \u201cPerplexity AI is an AI-powered search engine that combines features of traditional search engines and chatbots. It provides concise, real-time answers to user queries by pulling information from recent articles and indexing the web daily.\u201d\n\nA WIRED analysis and one carried out by developer Robb Knight suggest that Perplexity is able to achieve this partly through apparently ignoring a widely accepted web standard known as the Robots Exclusion Protocol to surreptitiously scrape areas of websites that operators do not want accessed by bots, despite claiming that it won\u2019t. WIRED observed a machine tied to Perplexity\u2014more specifically, one on an Amazon server and almost certainly operated by Perplexity\u2014doing this on WIRED.com and across other Cond\u00e9 Nast publications.\n\nThe WIRED analysis also demonstrates that, despite claims that Perplexity\u2019s tools provide \u201cinstant, reliable answers to any question with complete sources and citations included,\u201d doing away with the need to \u201cclick on different links,\u201d its chatbot, which is capable of accurately summarizing journalistic work with appropriate credit, is also prone to bullshitting, in the technical sense of the word.\n\nWIRED provided the Perplexity chatbot with the headlines of dozens of articles published on our website this year, as well as prompts about the subjects of WIRED reporting. The results showed the chatbot at times closely paraphrasing WIRED stories, and at times summarizing stories inaccurately and with minimal attribution.

According to server logs, that same IP visited properties belonging to Cond\u00e9 Nast, the media company that owns WIRED, at least 822 times in the past three months\u2014likely a significant undercount, because the company retains only a small portion of its records.\n\nWe also reported that the chatbot was bullshitting, in the technical sense.

Backed by Jeff Bezos\u2019 family office and by Nvidia, among others, Perplexity has said it is worth a billion dollars based on its most recent fundraising round, and The Information reported last month that it was in talks for a new round that would value it at $3 billion. (Bezos did not reply to an email; Nvidia declined to comment.)\n\nAfter we published the story, I prompted three leading chatbots to tell me about the story. OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Anthropic\u2019s Claude generated text offering hypotheses about the story\u2019s subject but noted that they had no access to the article.

{"title": "Microsoft\u2019s Mustafa Suleyman says he loves Sam Altman, believes he\u2019s sincere about AI safety", "text": "In an interview at the Aspen Ideas Festival on Tuesday, Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, made it very clear that he admires OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\nCNBC\u2019s Andrew Ross Sorkin asked what the plan will be when Microsoft\u2019s enormous AI future isn\u2019t so closely dependent on OpenAI, using a metaphor of winning a bicycling race. But Suleyman sidestepped.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t buy the metaphor that there is a finish line. This is another false frame,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to stop framing everything as a ferocious race.\u201d\n\nHe then proceeded to toe the Microsoft corporate line about his company\u2019s arrangement with OpenAI, in which it invested a reported $10 billion through some combination of cash and cloud credits. The deal gives Microsoft a big stake in OpenAI\u2019s for-profit business, and allows it to embed its AI models into Microsoft wares and sell its tech to Microsoft cloud customers. Some reports indicate that Microsoft may also be entitled to some OpenAI payments.\n\n\u201cIt is true that we have ferocious competition with them,\u201d Suleyman said about OpenAI. \u201cThey are an independent company. We don\u2019t own or control them. We don\u2019t even have any board members. So they do entirely their own thing. But we have a deep partnership. I\u2019m very good friends with Sam, have huge respect and, trust and faith in what they\u2019ve done. And that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to roll for many, many years to come,\u201d Suleyman said.\n\nThis close/distant relationship is important for Suleyman to profess. Microsoft\u2019s investors and enterprise customers appreciate the close relationship. But regulators did get curious and in April, the EU agreed that its investment was not a true takeover. Should that change, in all likelihood so would the regulatory involvement.\n\nSuleyman says he trusts Altman on AI safety\n\nIn a sense, Suleyman was the Sam Altman of AI before OpenAI. He has spent most of his career in competition with OpenAI, and is known for his own ego.\n\nSuleyman was the founder of AI pioneer DeepMind and sold it to Google in 2014. He was reportedly put on administrative leave following allegations of bullying employees, as Bloomberg reported in 2019, then moved to other Google roles before leaving the company in 2022 to join Greylock Partners as a venture partner. A few months later, he and Greylock\u2019s Reid Hoffman, a Microsoft board member, launched Inflection AI to build its own LLM chatbot, among other goals.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella tried but failed to hire Sam Altman last fall, when OpenAI fired him and then quickly reinstated him. After that, Microsoft hired Suleyman and much of Inflection in March, leaving a shell of a company and a big check. In his new role at Microsoft, Suleyman has been auditing OpenAI code, Semafor reported earlier this month. As one of OpenAI\u2019s previous big rivals, he\u2019s now getting to dive deep inside the crown-jewel frenemy competitor.\n\nThere\u2019s yet another wrinkle to all of this.

{"title": "Microsoft\u2019s Mustafa Suleyman says he loves Sam Altman, believes he\u2019s sincere about AI safety", "text": "In an interview at the Aspen Ideas Festival on Tuesday, Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, made it very clear that he admires OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\nCNBC\u2019s Andrew Ross Sorkin asked what the plan will be when Microsoft\u2019s enormous AI future isn\u2019t so closely dependent on OpenAI, using a metaphor of winning a bicycling race. But Suleyman sidestepped.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t buy the metaphor that there is a finish line. This is another false frame,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to stop framing everything as a ferocious race.\u201d\n\nHe then proceeded to toe the Microsoft corporate line about his company\u2019s arrangement with OpenAI, in which it invested a reported $10 billion through some combination of cash and cloud credits. The deal gives Microsoft a big stake in OpenAI\u2019s for-profit business, and allows it to embed its AI models into Microsoft wares and sell its tech to Microsoft cloud customers. Some reports indicate that Microsoft may also be entitled to some OpenAI payments.\n\n\u201cIt is true that we have ferocious competition with them,\u201d Suleyman said about OpenAI. \u201cThey are an independent company. We don\u2019t own or control them. We don\u2019t even have any board members. So they do entirely their own thing. But we have a deep partnership. I\u2019m very good friends with Sam, have huge respect and, trust and faith in what they\u2019ve done. And that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to roll for many, many years to come,\u201d Suleyman said.\n\nThis close/distant relationship is important for Suleyman to profess. Microsoft\u2019s investors and enterprise customers appreciate the close relationship. But regulators did get curious and in April, the EU agreed that its investment was not a true takeover. Should that change, in all likelihood so would the regulatory involvement.\n\nSuleyman says he trusts Altman on AI safety\n\nIn a sense, Suleyman was the Sam Altman of AI before OpenAI. He has spent most of his career in competition with OpenAI, and is known for his own ego.\n\nSuleyman was the founder of AI pioneer DeepMind and sold it to Google in 2014. He was reportedly put on administrative leave following allegations of bullying employees, as Bloomberg reported in 2019, then moved to other Google roles before leaving the company in 2022 to join Greylock Partners as a venture partner. A few months later, he and Greylock\u2019s Reid Hoffman, a Microsoft board member, launched Inflection AI to build its own LLM chatbot, among other goals.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella tried but failed to hire Sam Altman last fall, when OpenAI fired him and then quickly reinstated him. After that, Microsoft hired Suleyman and much of Inflection in March, leaving a shell of a company and a big check. In his new role at Microsoft, Suleyman has been auditing OpenAI code, Semafor reported earlier this month. As one of OpenAI\u2019s previous big rivals, he\u2019s now getting to dive deep inside the crown-jewel frenemy competitor.\n\nThere\u2019s yet another wrinkle to all of this. OpenAI was founded with a premise of doing AI safety research, to stop a one-day evil AI from destroying humankind. In 2023, when he was still an OpenAI competitor, Suleyman released a book called \u201cThe Coming Wave: Technology, Power and the 21st Century\u2019s Greatest Dilemma\u201d with researcher Michael Bhaskar.

But giving them actual, living skin that can be manipulated into horrifying, slimy expressions? That\u2019s new.\n\nThe new work, published in the journal Cell Reports Physical Science, is very much just an experiment. This will not be the face of your next smart home hub or vacuum.\n\nBut it may well be that the ingenious machinery produced by billions of years of evolution may be better in some situations than artificial skin (also very much in development) or simpler surfaces. This brings up several questions \u2014 many, in fact, but only one is really the topic of the paper, as is proper in scientific inquiry.\n\nTo wit: How would such a living tissue surface, whatever its advantages and disadvantages, attach to the mechanical foundation of a robot\u2019s limb or \u201cface\u201d?\n\nIn humans and other animals, there is a network of ligaments that anchors the skin to underlying muscle and tissue. This works pretty well, I\u2019ve found. And the researchers at the University of Tokyo and Harvard wanted to test whether they could create a version of this that let living skin both cling closely to an artificial substrate, and also be manipulated in various directions without tearing or unintended distortion.\n\nHow did their \u201cdermis equivalent\u201d turn out? I\u2019ll let you be the judge:\n\nImage Credits: University of Tokyo\n\nAh, nightmare fuel. But you can\u2019t accuse it of being anything less than well-moisturized.\n\nOf course it\u2019s horrifying now, but it\u2019s not intended to be realistic or beautiful \u2014 just to illustrate a potential method for attachment of living tissue to robotic undercarriage.\n\nYes, that is in fact exactly what a Terminator T-100 model has, but let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. Skin-covered robots could do all kinds of useful stuff in addition to infiltrating the past to destroy humanity\u2019s future.\n\nCultured skin, as they put it, can heal itself, carry biological sensors like our own to provide sensitive touch, and could also have benefits in medical or human interaction contexts.\n\nBut only if it can stay alive on there and also be moved around in the same ways our own skin is during everyday use.

{"title": "Fearless Fund\u2019s founder has resigned, and it\u2019s a sad reflection on the VC world for Black women", "text": "On Monday, Fearless Fund\u2019s co-founder Ayana Parsons announced that she was stepping down from her leadership role from the firm. She will no longer be its general partner and COO but will be off \u201cenjoying island life\u201d with her family, she said in a LinkedIn post. She co-founded the fund in 2019 with partner Arian Simone, who remains its CEO.\n\nFearless Fund was founded with a mission to provide venture capital financing, grants and financial education to startups founded by Black women. That\u2019s a demographic that is both particularly underserved and promising. Less than 1% of all VC dollars in 2023 went to Black-founded startups, which amounts to around $661 million out of $136 billion, according to Crunchbase data.\n\nSo Fearless Fund is doing exactly what venture capitalists are supposed to do: find an overlooked area (in Silicon Valley they might call it taking a \u201ccontrarian view\u201d) and invest. The fund has so far invested $26 million into over 40 companies that include Slutty Vegan, The Lip Bar, Partake Foods, and Live Tinted, Atlanta Daily World reports.\n\nThe money invested and granted is from private limited partners. The LPs who supported the fund want to support this thesis. The companies receiving money are still private startups. Since so little classic VC funding is going to these businesses, the community is building their own rails. Everyone in this ecosystem is OK with this.\n\nStill, it is being sued by a politically conservative group called the American Alliance for Equal Rights (AAER) over its charitable grants program. AAER is challenging the fund\u2019s right to provide $20,000 in small business grants to Black women, claiming the program violates the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which bans the use of race in contracts.\n\nAAER was founded by Edward Blum, an activist who helped successfully overturn affirmative action in universities and is now conducting several other lawsuits in similar veins (e.g., the AAER is currently suing the Smithsonian Institute\u2019s Latino Museum Studies Program for hiring Latino interns).\n\nThe case is not going particularly well for Fearless Fund. As TechCrunch recently reported, earlier this month an appeals court ruled against Fearless. It upheld a preliminary injunction that prevents the firm from making grants to Black women business owners. The firm told TechCrunch at that time it is weighing its options on how to proceed.\n\nLast year, when the case made national news, numerous founders and investors told TechCrunch about the infuriating irony of using the Civil Rights Act of 1866 to protest the firm\u2019s program, as it was initially put into place to help the formerly enslaved and is now being used against the community it sought to help.\n\nIn the months that followed, the frustration of this case within the community has not lessened. Earlier on Monday, Parsons had an emotional moment onstage at the ForbesBLK Summit in Atlanta. She was joined by political leader Stacey Abrams and the chief diversity officer of Congress, Dr. Sesha Joi Moon.\n\n\u201cAnytime you are surrounded by Black women, they are going to pour into you,\u2019\u2019 Parsons said, according to Forbes. \u201cSo, when I walked on this stage, these eyes were watering because they understood the heavy burden that is on all of us in this country.\u2019\u2019\n\nAfter announcing her resignation, Parsons told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and her spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the lawsuit against Fearless was not a motivating factor. But she did not otherwise explain her decision to leave. She also remains an investor in the fund. \u201cAs co-founder, Ayana is still an investor and she has always had multiple ventures centered around inclusion leadership and development, venture capital, and entrepreneurship. Fearless Fund is merely one avenue in her pursuit to be an advocate for the marginalized,\u201d her spokesperson said.\n\nParsons said in her LinkedIn post that she founded the firm \u201cto help change the game for women of color entrepreneurs. And my rationale was simple: women of color are the most founded yet the least funded. They are starting businesses at a faster rate than any other demographic yet lack access to the capital, resources, education and networks needed to scale their businesses.\u201d\n\nShe also promised not to give up on her goal. \u201cI remain steadfast in my support of and commitment to the advancement of women of color,\u201d she said in an emailed statement, mentioning that she\u2019ll soon be publishing a book, too.\n\nStill, as we previously pointed out, the sad fact is that big names in the tech ecosystem have not exactly come out swinging in support. CEO Simone told Inc. earlier this year that the fund had lost nearly all its partnerships aside from two, JPMorgan and Costco. Even Mastercard, who sponsored the now-contested Strivers Grant, has publicly never commented on the lawsuit.\n\nIndeed, support for anything considered DEI has done a complete pendulum swing in tech in 2024, from its height in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd. Currently, it has become more in vogue to publicly pan DEI and praise the so-called meritocracy.\n\nThis story was updated to include statements from Parsons and her public relations representative.", "authors": "['Julie Bort', 'Dominic-Madori Davis']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Kk3VUxfA-e1687456679564.jpg?resize=1200,717", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/fearless-fund-founder-resigned-vc-venture-capital-startups-black-women/", "timestamp": "1719366663.501632", "displayed": 0}

OpenAI\u2019s popular AI chatbot is available to all macOS users, the company announced on Tuesday. The app was first announced ahead of Apple\u2019s WWDC 2024 in June, where the companies jointly announced integrations between OpenAI\u2019s chatbot and Apple\u2019s operating systems for iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\nOn the latter platform, users can quickly call up ChatGPT by using the keyboard combination of Option + Space after installing the new ChatGPT app.\n\nThe ChatGPT desktop app for macOS is now available for all users.\n\n\n\nGet faster access to ChatGPT to chat about email, screenshots, and anything on your screen with the Option + Space shortcut: https://t.co/2rEx3PmMqg pic.twitter.com/x9sT8AnjDm \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) June 25, 2024\n\nThis makes access to the AI chatbot something that will immediately feel familiar to macOS users who regularly use other keyboard shortcuts like Command + Space to pop up a search bar to access Spotlight Search. But instead of more traditional search, they\u2019ll have access to a wider world of knowledge, only one button away. Once launched, ChatGPT appears as a chat interface overlaid on top of the screen.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s launch of the macOS app was a bit overshadowed at the time of the original announcement, as it arrived alongside GPT-4o, its flagship generative AI model that promises more advanced intelligence, including the ability to handle not only text and speech but also video. (Its multimodal capabilities and ability to understand media give the AI model its name; the \u201co\u201d stands for \u201comni.\u201d)\n\nChatGPT\u2019s desktop app was announced in the same press release, as a new app for both free and paid users. The company noted at the time that it could be called up with the simple keyboard shortcut and users could also take and discuss screenshots directly in the app. Users can upload files and other photos via the macOS app, too, as well as speak to ChatGPT from their desktop and search through their past conversations.\n\nThe app had been slowly rolling out to Mac users, starting with Plus subscribers, but today the company announced in a post on X that it\u2019s now available to everyone.\n\nThis isn\u2019t OpenAI\u2019s only integration with Apple devices. At WWDC, the companies announced a more expansive deal that will also see Apple customers gaining access to ChatGPT from their iPhones and iPads, including through Siri and within other areas that could be aided by AI, like Writing Tools.

Deal activity in healthcare IT was relatively flat in Q1 2024 at 74 total deals, valued at about $1 billion total, up only 3% from the year-ago quarter, according to PitchBook data.\n\nStill, promising startups have grabbed investors\u2019 attention this year. TechCrunch spoke with about a dozen healthcare VCs about the companies they think have the most promising future. While recently formed AI-driven startups that are solving staggering administrative challenges in the U.S. healthcare system dominated their recommendations, they also mentioned several slightly older, non-AI-focused businesses.\n\nWe narrowed their suggestions to the list of names that more than one VC mentioned, which came in at an even 10 companies. VCs discussed with us the companies that were both in their portfolios and not.\n\nAbridge\n\nWhat it does: Uses AI to automate medical records based on conversations between doctors and patients.\n\nFounded in 2018 by Shiv Rao, a practicing cardiologist, Abridge is an early entrant into the medical note-taking space and one that has secured integration with the all-powerful Epic Systems health records software.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: The Pittsburgh-based startup generates excitement among investors and hospital systems eager to free up physicians\u2019 time spent on note-taking. Abridge is the health tech startup that among investors we talked to was mentioned the most.\n\nSome investors said that Abridge is leading its category. Other companies competing to dominate the AI-powered medical note-taking market include Ambience, Nabla, Microsoft-owned Nuance and Suki.\n\nFunding: In February, Abridge raised a $150 million Series C led by Lightspeed Ventures at a valuation of $850 million, a mere four months after the virtual medical scribe startup grabbed a $30 million Series B from Spark Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners, CVS Health Ventures and others.\n\nCodaMetrix\n\nWhat it does: Founded in 2019, CodaMetrix uses AI to automate medical coding. The company\u2019s technology translates medical notes stored in electronic health records into diagnostic codes, helping to reduce errors and administrative burdens.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Medical coding is tedious and error-prone. Entering an incorrect code for a condition or treatment can lead to insurance rejection of claims and other administrative problems. Moreover, the burden of entering codes falls on already busy physicians and nurses, leading to increased stress and burnout.\n\nThe company has competitors, including Fathom Health, but investors say that CodaMetrix has one of the largest annotated coding datasets.\n\nFunding and valuation: In March, CodaMetrix grabbed a $40 million Series B from Transformation Capital with participation of returning investors SignalFire and Cressey Ventures. The deal valued the Boston-based company at $220 million, according to PitchBook.\n\nCohere Health\n\nWhat it does: Cohere Health expedites health insurance approval process, known as prior authorization, for medical conditions with the help of AI.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Prior authorization management could take medical and administrative staff hours as it requires gathering appropriate documentation for submission to health insurers or Medicaid. Cohere Health\u2019s AI can reduce the time it takes to do this to minutes, saving medical and administrative staff hours on these tasks.\n\nInvestors say that Cohere is for now the leader in the space, but other startups that expedite health insurance approval for medical conditions include Anterior and Alaffia Health.\n\nFunding: Cohere Health raised a $50 million Series B earlier this year from Deerfield Management with participation from Define Ventures, Polaris Partners, Longitude Capital and Flare Capital Partners.\n\nGrow Therapy\n\nWhat it does: Grow Therapy connects therapists who want to start independent practices with patients and insurers. Founded in 2020, the startup employs the so-called business-in-box model because it gives mental health professionals tools for filing claims, receiving payments and being matched with patients.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: The company claims that its business model offers therapists more flexibility than if they were to provide their services through marketplaces like Headway or Lyra. While it\u2019s not clear whether that\u2019s indeed the case, Grow, true to its name, is growing fast, investors say.\n\nFunding and valaution: In April, Grow closed an $88 million Series C led by Sequoia at a $1.4 billion valuation, according to PitchBook data.\n\nEquip\n\nWhat it does: Four-year-old Equip provides online treatment for kids, teens and adults in all 50 states and accepts most health insurances. Equip providers are also trained to address co-occurring conditions like anxiety, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: About 10% of the U.S. population develops an eating disorder during their lives, but only a fraction of these people receive help, according to the National Eating Disorders Association. The company\u2019s offering brings care to those who don\u2019t live near an eating disorder facility or prefer to be treated online.\n\nFunding and valuation: Equip was last valued at $505 million and has secured a total of $135 million in funding from investors, including Optum Ventures and General Catalyst, according to PitchBook data.\n\nMaven\n\nWhat it does: The New York-based health clinic and benefits platform offers services for fertility, adoption, parenting, pediatrics and menopause through employers, including Microsoft and AT&T. Maven also serves Medicaid patients.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Investors say that 10-year-old Maven continues to grow, given that its area of focus \u2014 digital health services for women and families \u2014 has been historically underserved. While VC interest in women\u2019s health has grown in recent years, the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022 has shined an even brighter spotlight on the need for technologies that serve the female population.\n\nFunding and valuation: Since its founding, Maven has raised nearly $300 million in funding and was last valued in late 2022 at $1.35 billion in a Series E round led by General Catalyst with the participation of VCs, including Lux Capital, Oak HC/FT and Sequoia.\n\nMemora Health\n\nWhat it does: Memora Health offers virtual AI-based care coordination, reducing administrative burdens for medical staff. The company\u2019s technology uses text messages to communicate with patients, automating tasks like appointment reminders, answering patients\u2019 common questions and collecting data about symptoms and post-procedure recovery.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Like many other AI-based healthcare startups, Memora saves medical staff time. The company also helps patients feel more supported on their health journey.\n\nFunding: The company spun out of Harvard Innovation Lab and went through Y Combinator in 2018. Since then, it has raised nearly $80 million and was valued in April 2023 at $430 million, according to PitchBook data. Memora\u2019s investors include General Catalyst and Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nSmarterDx\n\nWhat it does: Founded in 2020, SmarterDx uses AI to help hospitals not miss out on revenues by analyzing patients\u2019 lab results, medications and doctors\u2019 notes to find minor errors and omissions in patients\u2019 diagnoses and associated medical codes. The company\u2019s technology reviews patient charts for accuracy before a claim is sent to health insurance or Medicare.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Investors say that since Smarter Dx helps health systems realize more revenues, the value of the company\u2019s technology is easy to measure.\n\nFunding: In May, SmarterDx raised a $50 million Series B round led by Transformation Capital, with participation from Bessemer Venture Partners, Flare Capital Partners and Floodgate Fund. The latest capital infusion brought the company\u2019s total funding to $71 million.\n\nSummer Health\n\nWhat it does: The two-year-old Summer Health connects parents to pediatricians who, within minutes, respond to urgent care and behavioral concerns. The company provides its text messaging service directly to consumers and through employers who offer access to Summer Health as a benefit.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Busy and worried parents want answers to their children\u2019s health issues right away and around the clock. Summer Health reduces parents\u2019 concerns because they can get fast responses to their questions via an app.\n\nFunding: In April, Summer Health raised its $12 million Series A led by 7wireVentures and existing investors including Sequoia, Lux Capital and Chelsea Clinton\u2019s Metrodora Ventures.\n\nTranscarent\n\nWhat it does: Four-year-old Transcarent helps large companies save money on providing health insurance to employees. The startup gives employees access to discounted medications, telehealth services and personalized AI-generated answers about their health coverage.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Part of the company\u2019s fast rise could be attributed to its founder, Glen Tullman, who previously started Livongo, a chronic condition management company Teledoc acquired for $18.5 billion in 2020.\n\nThe company also recently introduced an AI platform that answers members\u2019 questions about coverage, offers clinical information and connects them with medical staff as needed.\n\nFunding and valuation: In May, the company raised a $450 million Series D at a $2.2 billion valuation led by General Catalyst and 7wireVentures.", "authors": "['Marina Temkin']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-927809262.jpg?resize=1200,600", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/10-of-the-most-exciting-digital-health-startups-of-2024-according-to-vcs/", "timestamp": "1719366673.3815522", "displayed": 0}

But Suleyman sidestepped.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t buy the metaphor that there is a finish line. This is another false frame,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to stop framing everything as a ferocious race.\u201d\n\nHe then proceeded to toe the Microsoft corporate line about his company\u2019s arrangement with OpenAI, in which it invested a reported $10 billion through some combination of cash and cloud credits. The deal gives Microsoft a big stake in OpenAI\u2019s for-profit business, and allows it to embed its AI models into Microsoft wares and sell its tech to Microsoft cloud customers. Some reports indicate that Microsoft may also be entitled to some OpenAI payments.\n\n\u201cIt is true that we have ferocious competition with them,\u201d Suleyman said about OpenAI. \u201cThey are an independent company. We don\u2019t own or control them. We don\u2019t even have any board members. So they do entirely their own thing. But we have a deep partnership. I\u2019m very good friends with Sam, have huge respect and, trust and faith in what they\u2019ve done. And that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to roll for many, many years to come,\u201d Suleyman said.\n\nThis close/distant relationship is important for Suleyman to profess. Microsoft\u2019s investors and enterprise customers appreciate the close relationship. But regulators did get curious and in April, the EU agreed that its investment was not a true takeover. Should that change, in all likelihood so would the regulatory involvement.\n\nSuleyman says he trusts Altman on AI safety\n\nIn a sense, Suleyman was the Sam Altman of AI before OpenAI. He has spent most of his career in competition with OpenAI, and is known for his own ego.\n\nSuleyman was the founder of AI pioneer DeepMind and sold it to Google in 2014. He was reportedly put on administrative leave following allegations of bullying employees, as Bloomberg reported in 2019, then moved to other Google roles before leaving the company in 2022 to join Greylock Partners as a venture partner. A few months later, he and Greylock\u2019s Reid Hoffman, a Microsoft board member, launched Inflection AI to build its own LLM chatbot, among other goals.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella tried but failed to hire Sam Altman last fall, when OpenAI fired him and then quickly reinstated him. After that, Microsoft hired Suleyman and much of Inflection in March, leaving a shell of a company and a big check. In his new role at Microsoft, Suleyman has been auditing OpenAI code, Semafor reported earlier this month. As one of OpenAI\u2019s previous big rivals, he\u2019s now getting to dive deep inside the crown-jewel frenemy competitor.\n\nThere\u2019s yet another wrinkle to all of this. OpenAI was founded with a premise of doing AI safety research, to stop a one-day evil AI from destroying humankind. In 2023, when he was still an OpenAI competitor, Suleyman released a book called \u201cThe Coming Wave: Technology, Power and the 21st Century\u2019s Greatest Dilemma\u201d with researcher Michael Bhaskar. The book discusses the dangers of AI and how to prevent them.\n\nA group of former OpenAI employees signed a letter earlier this month outlining their fears that OpenAI and other AI companies are not taking safety seriously enough.\n\nWhen asked about that, Suleyman also proclaimed his love and trust for Altman, but also that he wants to see both regulation and a slower pace.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m a Brit with European tendencies, but I don\u2019t fear regulation in the way that sort of everyone seems to by default,\u201d he said, describing all of this fingerpointing by the former employees as a \u201chealthy dialogue.\u201d He added, \u201cI think it\u2019s a great thing that technologists and entrepreneurs and CEOs of companies like myself and Sam, who I love dearly and think is awesome\u201d are talking about regulation. \u201cHe is not cynical, he is sincere. He believes it genuinely.\u201d\n\nBut he also said, \u201cFriction is going to be our friend here. These technologies are becoming so powerful, they will be so intimate, they\u2019ll be so ever-present, that this is a moment where it\u2019s fine to take stock.\u201d If all of this dialog slows down AI development by six to 18 months or longer \u201cit\u2019s time well spent.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all very cozy between these players.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman Image Credits: TechCrunch\n\nSuleyman wants cooperation with China, AI in classrooms\n\nSuleyman also made some interesting comments on other issues. On the AI race with China:\n\n\u201cWith all due respect to my good friends in DC and the military industrial complex, if it\u2019s the default frame that it can only be a new Cold War, then that is exactly what it will be because it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. They will fear that we fear that we\u2019re going to be adversarial so they have to be adversarial and this is only going to escalate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to find ways to cooperate, be respectful of them, whilst also acknowledging that we have a different set of values.\u201d\n\nThen again, he also said that China is \u201cbuilding their own technology ecosystem, and they\u2019re spreading that around the world. We should really pay close attention.\u201d\n\nWhen asked his opinion on kids using AI for schoolwork, Suleyman, who said he doesn\u2019t have kids, shrugged it off. \u201cI think we have to be slightly careful about fearing the downside of every tool, you know, just as when calculators came in, there was a kind of this gut reaction, oh, no, everyone\u2019s gonna be able to sort of solve all the equations instantly. And it\u2019s gonna make us dumber because we weren\u2019t able to do mental arithmetic.\u201d\n\nHe also envisions a time, very soon, where AI is like a teacher\u2019s aide, perhaps chatting live in the classroom, as AI\u2019s verbal skills improve. \u201cWhat would it look like for a great teacher or educator to have a profound conversation with an AI that is live and in front of their audience?\u201d\n\nThe upshot takeaway is that, if we want the people who are building and profiting from AI to govern and protect humanity from its worst effects, we may be setting unrealistic expectations.", "authors": "['Julie Bort']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Microsoft-AI-CEO-Mustafa-Suleyman.png?resize=1200,624", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/microsofts-mustafa-suleyman-says-he-loves-sam-altman-believes-hes-sincere-about-ai-safety/", "timestamp": "1719366677.635893", "displayed": 0}

The company\u2019s technology translates medical notes stored in electronic health records into diagnostic codes, helping to reduce errors and administrative burdens.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Medical coding is tedious and error-prone. Entering an incorrect code for a condition or treatment can lead to insurance rejection of claims and other administrative problems. Moreover, the burden of entering codes falls on already busy physicians and nurses, leading to increased stress and burnout.\n\nThe company has competitors, including Fathom Health, but investors say that CodaMetrix has one of the largest annotated coding datasets.\n\nFunding and valuation: In March, CodaMetrix grabbed a $40 million Series B from Transformation Capital with participation of returning investors SignalFire and Cressey Ventures. The deal valued the Boston-based company at $220 million, according to PitchBook.\n\nCohere Health\n\nWhat it does: Cohere Health expedites health insurance approval process, known as prior authorization, for medical conditions with the help of AI.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Prior authorization management could take medical and administrative staff hours as it requires gathering appropriate documentation for submission to health insurers or Medicaid. Cohere Health\u2019s AI can reduce the time it takes to do this to minutes, saving medical and administrative staff hours on these tasks.\n\nInvestors say that Cohere is for now the leader in the space, but other startups that expedite health insurance approval for medical conditions include Anterior and Alaffia Health.\n\nFunding: Cohere Health raised a $50 million Series B earlier this year from Deerfield Management with participation from Define Ventures, Polaris Partners, Longitude Capital and Flare Capital Partners.\n\nGrow Therapy\n\nWhat it does: Grow Therapy connects therapists who want to start independent practices with patients and insurers. Founded in 2020, the startup employs the so-called business-in-box model because it gives mental health professionals tools for filing claims, receiving payments and being matched with patients.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: The company claims that its business model offers therapists more flexibility than if they were to provide their services through marketplaces like Headway or Lyra. While it\u2019s not clear whether that\u2019s indeed the case, Grow, true to its name, is growing fast, investors say.\n\nFunding and valaution: In April, Grow closed an $88 million Series C led by Sequoia at a $1.4 billion valuation, according to PitchBook data.\n\nEquip\n\nWhat it does: Four-year-old Equip provides online treatment for kids, teens and adults in all 50 states and accepts most health insurances. Equip providers are also trained to address co-occurring conditions like anxiety, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: About 10% of the U.S. population develops an eating disorder during their lives, but only a fraction of these people receive help, according to the National Eating Disorders Association. The company\u2019s offering brings care to those who don\u2019t live near an eating disorder facility or prefer to be treated online.\n\nFunding and valuation: Equip was last valued at $505 million and has secured a total of $135 million in funding from investors, including Optum Ventures and General Catalyst, according to PitchBook data.\n\nMaven\n\nWhat it does: The New York-based health clinic and benefits platform offers services for fertility, adoption, parenting, pediatrics and menopause through employers, including Microsoft and AT&T. Maven also serves Medicaid patients.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Investors say that 10-year-old Maven continues to grow, given that its area of focus \u2014 digital health services for women and families \u2014 has been historically underserved. While VC interest in women\u2019s health has grown in recent years, the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022 has shined an even brighter spotlight on the need for technologies that serve the female population.\n\nFunding and valuation: Since its founding, Maven has raised nearly $300 million in funding and was last valued in late 2022 at $1.35 billion in a Series E round led by General Catalyst with the participation of VCs, including Lux Capital, Oak HC/FT and Sequoia.\n\nMemora Health\n\nWhat it does: Memora Health offers virtual AI-based care coordination, reducing administrative burdens for medical staff. The company\u2019s technology uses text messages to communicate with patients, automating tasks like appointment reminders, answering patients\u2019 common questions and collecting data about symptoms and post-procedure recovery.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Like many other AI-based healthcare startups, Memora saves medical staff time. The company also helps patients feel more supported on their health journey.\n\nFunding: The company spun out of Harvard Innovation Lab and went through Y Combinator in 2018. Since then, it has raised nearly $80 million and was valued in April 2023 at $430 million, according to PitchBook data. Memora\u2019s investors include General Catalyst and Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nSmarterDx\n\nWhat it does: Founded in 2020, SmarterDx uses AI to help hospitals not miss out on revenues by analyzing patients\u2019 lab results, medications and doctors\u2019 notes to find minor errors and omissions in patients\u2019 diagnoses and associated medical codes. The company\u2019s technology reviews patient charts for accuracy before a claim is sent to health insurance or Medicare.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Investors say that since Smarter Dx helps health systems realize more revenues, the value of the company\u2019s technology is easy to measure.\n\nFunding: In May, SmarterDx raised a $50 million Series B round led by Transformation Capital, with participation from Bessemer Venture Partners, Flare Capital Partners and Floodgate Fund. The latest capital infusion brought the company\u2019s total funding to $71 million.\n\nSummer Health\n\nWhat it does: The two-year-old Summer Health connects parents to pediatricians who, within minutes, respond to urgent care and behavioral concerns. The company provides its text messaging service directly to consumers and through employers who offer access to Summer Health as a benefit.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Busy and worried parents want answers to their children\u2019s health issues right away and around the clock. Summer Health reduces parents\u2019 concerns because they can get fast responses to their questions via an app.\n\nFunding: In April, Summer Health raised its $12 million Series A led by 7wireVentures and existing investors including Sequoia, Lux Capital and Chelsea Clinton\u2019s Metrodora Ventures.\n\nTranscarent\n\nWhat it does: Four-year-old Transcarent helps large companies save money on providing health insurance to employees. The startup gives employees access to discounted medications, telehealth services and personalized AI-generated answers about their health coverage.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Part of the company\u2019s fast rise could be attributed to its founder, Glen Tullman, who previously started Livongo, a chronic condition management company Teledoc acquired for $18.5 billion in 2020.\n\nThe company also recently introduced an AI platform that answers members\u2019 questions about coverage, offers clinical information and connects them with medical staff as needed.\n\nFunding and valuation: In May, the company raised a $450 million Series D at a $2.2 billion valuation led by General Catalyst and 7wireVentures.", "authors": "['Marina Temkin']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-927809262.jpg?resize=1200,600", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/10-of-the-most-exciting-digital-health-startups-of-2024-according-to-vcs/", "timestamp": "1719366683.139871", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "Welcome to the fediverse: Your guide to Mastodon, Threads, Bluesky, and more", "text": "From tiny acorns to a digital forest, here\u2019s everything you need to know about the fediverse\n\nOnce upon a time, in a galaxy not so far away (this one, in fact), a few internet rebels decided that they were tired of the corporate overlords controlling their online lives. Thus, the fediverse was born \u2014 an attempt to wrest control of microblogging services, such as Twitter and its ilk, away from centralized powers and into the hands of the people.\n\nThe term \u201cfediverse\u201d combines \u201cfederation\u201d and \u201cuniverse.\u201d In a nutshell, it\u2019s a collection of social networking services that can communicate with each other (formally known as federation).\n\nThe fediverse roots trace back to the 2000s, with the rise of projects like StatusNet, which later evolved into GNU social. The big bang happened in 2016 when Mastodon, an open-source microblogging platform, entered the scene. Since then, myriad decentralized platforms have sprouted, including Bluesky, Threads, and Pleroma, each with its unique flavor, all united by their disdain for Big Tech\u2019s centralized control.\n\nGNU Social and StatusNet were the pioneers. They aimed to create a more open and free web, where users controlled their data and interactions. StatusNet\u2019s most notable instance, identi.ca, was an early example of a federated social network. However, these platforms struggled to gain mainstream traction due to technical complexity and limited user bases \u2013 kinda like the early days of crypto, come to think of it.\n\nThen, in 2016, Mastodon entered the scene. It was created by Eugen Rochko, a Russia-born software developer who decamped to Germany. With a familiar interface and an emphasis on user experience, Mastodon quickly became the poster child of the fediverse. Its success lay in balancing decentralization with usability, attracting users tired of Twitter\u2019s toxic environment and draconian policies. Mastodon\u2019s growth was exponential, sparking interest and spawning numerous other fediverse projects.\n\nWhy the fediverse could be the next big thing in social media\n\nThe fediverse isn\u2019t just another social media platform; it\u2019s a rallying cry and a manifesto of sorts. Here are a few reasons why its fans believe it\u2019s the next big thing:\n\nPower to the people: With decentralization as its rallying cry, no single entity controls the fediverse. It\u2019s like the Wild West but with fewer guns and (a lot) more memes. This decentralization means users have more control over their data and interactions. Each server operates independently yet can still communicate with others, creating a vast, interconnected network. This structure prevents the concentration of power and mitigates the risks associated with data breaches and surveillance.\n\nYour data, your rules: Privacy often plays a big part in the conversation around the fediverse. Unlike certain social media giants, fediverse platforms claim they don\u2019t sell your data to the highest bidder. Many instances prioritize user privacy, with policies prohibiting data mining and tracking. Users can choose servers with privacy-focused practices and even host their own instances for maximum control. This approach appeals to those concerned about their digital footprint and the pervasive surveillance of corporate social media.\n\nLike the OG internet: The fediverse fosters small, tight-knit communities where you can actually have meaningful conversations instead of screaming into the void. Each server often caters to specific interests or values, enabling users to find like-minded individuals. This community-centric approach contrasts sharply with the global, often chaotic nature of platforms like Twitter and Facebook, where meaningful interactions are buried under a deluge of noise.\n\nHave it your way: If your perfect blend of spices doesn\u2019t exist, you can make your own: The software is open-source, so you can go ham with the hacking. Want a purple interface where all posts are automatically translated into Klingon? You do you, boo. The fediverse\u2019s flexibility allows users to customize their experiences, from interface design to functionality. Developers can create and share modifications, enhancing the platform\u2019s capabilities and fostering innovation. This adaptability \u2014 at least in theory \u2014 ensures that the fediverse evolves with its users, staying relevant and responsive to their needs.\n\nKey players in the fediverse\n\nThe fediverse is kinda like \u201cBeing John Malkovich\u201d in that there are a lot of actors, but they all kind of look alike. This is where a lot of the confusion comes from. Here are some of the key players worth being aware of:\n\nMastodon is an open-source, decentralized social network within the broader fediverse. It enables users to create and join independent, interconnected communities or instances governed by rules and moderation policies. This structure promotes user autonomy and content diversity while reducing reliance on centralized control. By offering a more user-centric alternative to traditional social media platforms, Mastodon has long been a key player and plays a crucial role in the fediverse, fostering a collaborative and resilient digital landscape emphasizing privacy, free expression, and community-driven interaction.\n\nBluesky (bsky among friends) is an interesting player in this space. As a brainchild of Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, Bluesky\u2019s focus on open protocols aims to dismantle the monopolistic hold of major social media companies. Focusing on commitment to interoperability and user control differentiates it from other fediverse platforms, making it a pioneering force in the push toward a more liberated and equitable online landscape.\n\nThreads is Meta\u2019s runner in the fediverse race. It uses the ActivityPub protocol, which lets Threads fly the platform interoperability flag the fediverse is known for \u2013 although Meta has received some criticism for being slow to fully participate. Still, with the weight of Meta behind it, Threads positions itself as a key player in the evolution of a more connected and diverse online ecosystem.\n\nPleroma is another microblogging platform, similar to Mastodon but lighter and more customizable. Developed by Lain and based on the Elixir programming language, Pleroma offers greater flexibility and performance. It\u2019s a favorite among tech-savvy users who want more control over their social media experience. Pleroma\u2019s modularity allows it to integrate various features from other platforms, making it a versatile choice for those looking to escape the mainstream.\n\nFor those who love Instagram but hate its corporate antics, Pixelfed is the answer. This photo-sharing platform focuses on privacy and user control. It offers a familiar interface, complete with filters and photo albums, but without the ads and algorithms pushing sponsored content. Pixelfed is perfect for photographers, artists and anyone who wants to share visual content without the noise of traditional social media.\n\nFriendica, meanwhile, is a versatile platform that can connect with almost any other social network. It supports many protocols, including ActivityPub (used by Mastodon and Pleroma), Diaspora, and even old-school protocols like RSS. Friendica is a great choice for users who want to bridge the gap between the fediverse and traditional social media platforms. Its flexibility and integration capabilities make it the ultimate social network aggregator.\n\nYouTube\u2019s video-sharing dominance is undeniable, but PeerTube offers a decentralized alternative. Developed by Framasoft, PeerTube enables users to host their own video servers, interconnecting with other instances to share content. This decentralization ensures that no single entity controls the platform, promoting free speech and diverse content. PeerTube is often held up as the ideal for creators who value independence and want to escape the ad-driven, algorithmic world of YouTube.\n\nWait, are there really no downsides to the fediverse?\n\nWelllll\u2026 Of course, it\u2019s not all rainbows and unicorns. The fediverse has its own set of issues and growing pains\n\nToo many cooks. With great power comes great responsibility. In this case, a million tiny servers, each with its own rules. This fragmentation can make the fediverse feel disjointed, with varying levels of quality and user experience. Navigating this landscape can confuse newcomers who may struggle to find the right instance or understand the platform\u2019s nuances. While diversity is a strength, it also presents challenges regarding coherence and user adoption.\n\nOnly the tech-savvy need apply? Setting up and maintaining your own server can be a headache unless you\u2019re a tech wizard, and the \u201conly nerds may apply\u201d vibe runs strong. The technical barrier to entry can be daunting, deterring less tech-savvy users from fully engaging with the fediverse. While user-friendly instances exist, the overall complexity remains a hurdle for widespread adoption. Simplifying the user experience and lowering technical barriers will be crucial for the fediverse\u2019s growth.\n\nThe popular kid on the block. Some platforms struggle under the weight of their own popularity. Growing pains, they call it, which makes sense, but it doubles down on the tech-savvy vibe from above: Instances can become overwhelmed by a sudden influx of users, leading to performance issues and downtime for folks who are least likely to tolerate (or know what to do with) sudden downtime. This scalability problem highlights the challenges of maintaining decentralized networks without the resources of corporate giants. Balancing growth and stability will be essential for the fediverse\u2019s sustainability \u2014 and continue to be one of its biggest stumbling blocks.\n\nWait, what\u2019s with all the racism? Without a central authority, content moderation can be hit or miss. And let\u2019s be honest, especially in the early days, users are experiencing more misses than hits. Each instance sets its own moderation policies, leading to inconsistencies and potential conflicts. While this allows for diverse community standards, it also means that harmful content can proliferate on poorly moderated servers. Anyone who\u2019s run a popular social network knows that effective and consistent moderation is critical to ensuring safe and welcoming environments, but achieving this across a decentralized network is\u2026 let\u2019s call it \u201can unsolved challenge.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next for the fediverse?\n\nLemme bust out the crystal ball and see if I can come up with some predictions. Will it overthrow the social media titans and usher in a new era of digital utopia? Probably not \u2014 or at least not for a while. But there is hope for it to play to its strengths and continue to grow as a haven for those tired of being commodified by Big Tech.\n\nI expect more platforms to join the fray, each more niche than the last. The fediverse\u2019s open nature encourages innovation, and we can anticipate a proliferation of new projects catering to specific communities and interests. This diversity will enrich the ecosystem, offering users more choices and fostering a vibrant digital culture. However, it will also exacerbate the challenges of fragmentation and interoperability.\n\nIndeed, the way that these platforms talk to each other is through various protocols, which, let\u2019s be frank, only a handful of people will understand or care about. ActivityPub currently dominates the fediverse, but other protocols like Zot and Diaspora have their proponents. In the future, we will likely see ongoing efforts to improve and standardize these protocols, enhancing cross-platform communication and integration. This technical evolution will be crucial for the fediverse\u2019s cohesion and growth.\n\nMainstream adoption remains a significant challenge. There is a handful of extremely popular microblogging platforms, all of which are significant competitors to the fediverse. Its complex nature and decentralized ethos may deter the average user accustomed to the simplicity and familiarity of corporate social media. To attract a broader audience, the fediverse will have to find a way to streamline its user experience, improve accessibility and offer compelling alternatives to mainstream platforms. Collaboration with privacy advocates, open-source communities and digital rights organizations could also help raise awareness and drive adoption.\n\nIn the long run, it\u2019s going to be interesting to see how the tech giants respond. As the fediverse gains traction, it\u2019s only a matter of time before the usual suspects start to pay notice (Meta, Google, X, Amazon \u2013 yes, I\u2019m looking at y\u2019all). While this could bring resources and attention, it also risks undermining the very principles that define the fediverse. The community will have to navigate these waters carefully, balancing growth with integrity.\n\nAll we are is another click in the wall\n\nIn the end, the fediverse will probably remain a quirky, fragmented and occasionally frustrating part of the internet. But it\u2019s a digital home worth exploring for those who value privacy, community and control. Don\u2019t forget to bring your sense of adventure \u2014 and maybe a manual on setting up servers.\n\nThe most exciting thing about the fediverse is that it ain\u2019t about perfection; it\u2019s about possibilities and counter-culture. It\u2019s a grand experiment in what the internet could be \u2014 free from the monopolistic tendencies of Big Tech, driven by community values, and open to endless innovation. So, whether you\u2019re a tech enthusiast, a privacy advocate or just someone tired of the same old social media grind, give the fediverse a shot.

{"title": "Welcome to the fediverse: Your guide to Mastodon, Threads, Bluesky, and more", "text": "From tiny acorns to a digital forest, here\u2019s everything you need to know about the fediverse\n\nOnce upon a time, in a galaxy not so far away (this one, in fact), a few internet rebels decided that they were tired of the corporate overlords controlling their online lives. Thus, the fediverse was born \u2014 an attempt to wrest control of microblogging services, such as Twitter and its ilk, away from centralized powers and into the hands of the people.\n\nThe term \u201cfediverse\u201d combines \u201cfederation\u201d and \u201cuniverse.\u201d In a nutshell, it\u2019s a collection of social networking services that can communicate with each other (formally known as federation).\n\nThe fediverse roots trace back to the 2000s, with the rise of projects like StatusNet, which later evolved into GNU social. The big bang happened in 2016 when Mastodon, an open-source microblogging platform, entered the scene. Since then, myriad decentralized platforms have sprouted, including Bluesky, Threads, and Pleroma, each with its unique flavor, all united by their disdain for Big Tech\u2019s centralized control.\n\nGNU Social and StatusNet were the pioneers. They aimed to create a more open and free web, where users controlled their data and interactions. StatusNet\u2019s most notable instance, identi.ca, was an early example of a federated social network. However, these platforms struggled to gain mainstream traction due to technical complexity and limited user bases \u2013 kinda like the early days of crypto, come to think of it.\n\nThen, in 2016, Mastodon entered the scene. It was created by Eugen Rochko, a Russia-born software developer who decamped to Germany. With a familiar interface and an emphasis on user experience, Mastodon quickly became the poster child of the fediverse. Its success lay in balancing decentralization with usability, attracting users tired of Twitter\u2019s toxic environment and draconian policies. Mastodon\u2019s growth was exponential, sparking interest and spawning numerous other fediverse projects.\n\nWhy the fediverse could be the next big thing in social media\n\nThe fediverse isn\u2019t just another social media platform; it\u2019s a rallying cry and a manifesto of sorts. Here are a few reasons why its fans believe it\u2019s the next big thing:\n\nPower to the people: With decentralization as its rallying cry, no single entity controls the fediverse. It\u2019s like the Wild West but with fewer guns and (a lot) more memes. This decentralization means users have more control over their data and interactions. Each server operates independently yet can still communicate with others, creating a vast, interconnected network. This structure prevents the concentration of power and mitigates the risks associated with data breaches and surveillance.\n\nYour data, your rules: Privacy often plays a big part in the conversation around the fediverse. Unlike certain social media giants, fediverse platforms claim they don\u2019t sell your data to the highest bidder. Many instances prioritize user privacy, with policies prohibiting data mining and tracking. Users can choose servers with privacy-focused practices and even host their own instances for maximum control. This approach appeals to those concerned about their digital footprint and the pervasive surveillance of corporate social media.\n\nLike the OG internet: The fediverse fosters small, tight-knit communities where you can actually have meaningful conversations instead of screaming into the void. Each server often caters to specific interests or values, enabling users to find like-minded individuals. This community-centric approach contrasts sharply with the global, often chaotic nature of platforms like Twitter and Facebook, where meaningful interactions are buried under a deluge of noise.\n\nHave it your way: If your perfect blend of spices doesn\u2019t exist, you can make your own: The software is open-source, so you can go ham with the hacking. Want a purple interface where all posts are automatically translated into Klingon? You do you, boo. The fediverse\u2019s flexibility allows users to customize their experiences, from interface design to functionality. Developers can create and share modifications, enhancing the platform\u2019s capabilities and fostering innovation. This adaptability \u2014 at least in theory \u2014 ensures that the fediverse evolves with its users, staying relevant and responsive to their needs.\n\nKey players in the fediverse\n\nThe fediverse is kinda like \u201cBeing John Malkovich\u201d in that there are a lot of actors, but they all kind of look alike. This is where a lot of the confusion comes from. Here are some of the key players worth being aware of:\n\nMastodon is an open-source, decentralized social network within the broader fediverse. It enables users to create and join independent, interconnected communities or instances governed by rules and moderation policies. This structure promotes user autonomy and content diversity while reducing reliance on centralized control. By offering a more user-centric alternative to traditional social media platforms, Mastodon has long been a key player and plays a crucial role in the fediverse, fostering a collaborative and resilient digital landscape emphasizing privacy, free expression, and community-driven interaction.\n\nBluesky (bsky among friends) is an interesting player in this space. As a brainchild of Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, Bluesky\u2019s focus on open protocols aims to dismantle the monopolistic hold of major social media companies. Focusing on commitment to interoperability and user control differentiates it from other fediverse platforms, making it a pioneering force in the push toward a more liberated and equitable online landscape.\n\nThreads is Meta\u2019s runner in the fediverse race. It uses the ActivityPub protocol, which lets Threads fly the platform interoperability flag the fediverse is known for \u2013 although Meta has received some criticism for being slow to fully participate. Still, with the weight of Meta behind it, Threads positions itself as a key player in the evolution of a more connected and diverse online ecosystem.\n\nPleroma is another microblogging platform, similar to Mastodon but lighter and more customizable. Developed by Lain and based on the Elixir programming language, Pleroma offers greater flexibility and performance. It\u2019s a favorite among tech-savvy users who want more control over their social media experience. Pleroma\u2019s modularity allows it to integrate various features from other platforms, making it a versatile choice for those looking to escape the mainstream.\n\nFor those who love Instagram but hate its corporate antics, Pixelfed is the answer. This photo-sharing platform focuses on privacy and user control. It offers a familiar interface, complete with filters and photo albums, but without the ads and algorithms pushing sponsored content. Pixelfed is perfect for photographers, artists and anyone who wants to share visual content without the noise of traditional social media.\n\nFriendica, meanwhile, is a versatile platform that can connect with almost any other social network. It supports many protocols, including ActivityPub (used by Mastodon and Pleroma), Diaspora, and even old-school protocols like RSS. Friendica is a great choice for users who want to bridge the gap between the fediverse and traditional social media platforms. Its flexibility and integration capabilities make it the ultimate social network aggregator.\n\nYouTube\u2019s video-sharing dominance is undeniable, but PeerTube offers a decentralized alternative. Developed by Framasoft, PeerTube enables users to host their own video servers, interconnecting with other instances to share content. This decentralization ensures that no single entity controls the platform, promoting free speech and diverse content. PeerTube is often held up as the ideal for creators who value independence and want to escape the ad-driven, algorithmic world of YouTube.\n\nWait, are there really no downsides to the fediverse?\n\nWelllll\u2026 Of course, it\u2019s not all rainbows and unicorns. The fediverse has its own set of issues and growing pains\n\nToo many cooks. With great power comes great responsibility. In this case, a million tiny servers, each with its own rules. This fragmentation can make the fediverse feel disjointed, with varying levels of quality and user experience. Navigating this landscape can confuse newcomers who may struggle to find the right instance or understand the platform\u2019s nuances. While diversity is a strength, it also presents challenges regarding coherence and user adoption.\n\nOnly the tech-savvy need apply? Setting up and maintaining your own server can be a headache unless you\u2019re a tech wizard, and the \u201conly nerds may apply\u201d vibe runs strong. The technical barrier to entry can be daunting, deterring less tech-savvy users from fully engaging with the fediverse. While user-friendly instances exist, the overall complexity remains a hurdle for widespread adoption. Simplifying the user experience and lowering technical barriers will be crucial for the fediverse\u2019s growth.\n\nThe popular kid on the block. Some platforms struggle under the weight of their own popularity. Growing pains, they call it, which makes sense, but it doubles down on the tech-savvy vibe from above: Instances can become overwhelmed by a sudden influx of users, leading to performance issues and downtime for folks who are least likely to tolerate (or know what to do with) sudden downtime. This scalability problem highlights the challenges of maintaining decentralized networks without the resources of corporate giants. Balancing growth and stability will be essential for the fediverse\u2019s sustainability \u2014 and continue to be one of its biggest stumbling blocks.\n\nWait, what\u2019s with all the racism? Without a central authority, content moderation can be hit or miss. And let\u2019s be honest, especially in the early days, users are experiencing more misses than hits. Each instance sets its own moderation policies, leading to inconsistencies and potential conflicts. While this allows for diverse community standards, it also means that harmful content can proliferate on poorly moderated servers. Anyone who\u2019s run a popular social network knows that effective and consistent moderation is critical to ensuring safe and welcoming environments, but achieving this across a decentralized network is\u2026 let\u2019s call it \u201can unsolved challenge.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next for the fediverse?\n\nLemme bust out the crystal ball and see if I can come up with some predictions. Will it overthrow the social media titans and usher in a new era of digital utopia? Probably not \u2014 or at least not for a while. But there is hope for it to play to its strengths and continue to grow as a haven for those tired of being commodified by Big Tech.\n\nI expect more platforms to join the fray, each more niche than the last. The fediverse\u2019s open nature encourages innovation, and we can anticipate a proliferation of new projects catering to specific communities and interests. This diversity will enrich the ecosystem, offering users more choices and fostering a vibrant digital culture. However, it will also exacerbate the challenges of fragmentation and interoperability.\n\nIndeed, the way that these platforms talk to each other is through various protocols, which, let\u2019s be frank, only a handful of people will understand or care about. ActivityPub currently dominates the fediverse, but other protocols like Zot and Diaspora have their proponents. In the future, we will likely see ongoing efforts to improve and standardize these protocols, enhancing cross-platform communication and integration. This technical evolution will be crucial for the fediverse\u2019s cohesion and growth.\n\nMainstream adoption remains a significant challenge. There is a handful of extremely popular microblogging platforms, all of which are significant competitors to the fediverse. Its complex nature and decentralized ethos may deter the average user accustomed to the simplicity and familiarity of corporate social media. To attract a broader audience, the fediverse will have to find a way to streamline its user experience, improve accessibility and offer compelling alternatives to mainstream platforms. Collaboration with privacy advocates, open-source communities and digital rights organizations could also help raise awareness and drive adoption.\n\nIn the long run, it\u2019s going to be interesting to see how the tech giants respond. As the fediverse gains traction, it\u2019s only a matter of time before the usual suspects start to pay notice (Meta, Google, X, Amazon \u2013 yes, I\u2019m looking at y\u2019all). While this could bring resources and attention, it also risks undermining the very principles that define the fediverse. The community will have to navigate these waters carefully, balancing growth with integrity.\n\nAll we are is another click in the wall\n\nIn the end, the fediverse will probably remain a quirky, fragmented and occasionally frustrating part of the internet. But it\u2019s a digital home worth exploring for those who value privacy, community and control. Don\u2019t forget to bring your sense of adventure \u2014 and maybe a manual on setting up servers.\n\nThe most exciting thing about the fediverse is that it ain\u2019t about perfection; it\u2019s about possibilities and counter-culture. It\u2019s a grand experiment in what the internet could be \u2014 free from the monopolistic tendencies of Big Tech, driven by community values, and open to endless innovation. So, whether you\u2019re a tech enthusiast, a privacy advocate or just someone tired of the same old social media grind, give the fediverse a shot.

She co-founded the fund in 2019 with partner Arian Simone, who remains its CEO.\n\nFearless Fund was founded with a mission to provide venture capital financing, grants and financial education to startups founded by Black women. That\u2019s a demographic that is both particularly underserved and promising. Less than 1% of all VC dollars in 2023 went to Black-founded startups, which amounts to around $661 million out of $136 billion, according to Crunchbase data.\n\nSo Fearless Fund is doing exactly what venture capitalists are supposed to do: find an overlooked area (in Silicon Valley they might call it taking a \u201ccontrarian view\u201d) and invest. The fund has so far invested $26 million into over 40 companies that include Slutty Vegan, The Lip Bar, Partake Foods, and Live Tinted, Atlanta Daily World reports.\n\nThe money invested and granted is from private limited partners. The LPs who supported the fund want to support this thesis. The companies receiving money are still private startups. Since so little classic VC funding is going to these businesses, the community is building their own rails. Everyone in this ecosystem is OK with this.\n\nStill, it is being sued by a politically conservative group called the American Alliance for Equal Rights (AAER) over its charitable grants program. AAER is challenging the fund\u2019s right to provide $20,000 in small business grants to Black women, claiming the program violates the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which bans the use of race in contracts.\n\nAAER was founded by Edward Blum, an activist who helped successfully overturn affirmative action in universities and is now conducting several other lawsuits in similar veins (e.g., the AAER is currently suing the Smithsonian Institute\u2019s Latino Museum Studies Program for hiring Latino interns).\n\nThe case is not going particularly well for Fearless Fund. As TechCrunch recently reported, earlier this month an appeals court ruled against Fearless. It upheld a preliminary injunction that prevents the firm from making grants to Black women business owners. The firm told TechCrunch at that time it is weighing its options on how to proceed.\n\nLast year, when the case made national news, numerous founders and investors told TechCrunch about the infuriating irony of using the Civil Rights Act of 1866 to protest the firm\u2019s program, as it was initially put into place to help the formerly enslaved and is now being used against the community it sought to help.\n\nIn the months that followed, the frustration of this case within the community has not lessened. Earlier on Monday, Parsons had an emotional moment onstage at the ForbesBLK Summit in Atlanta. She was joined by political leader Stacey Abrams and the chief diversity officer of Congress, Dr. Sesha Joi Moon.\n\n\u201cAnytime you are surrounded by Black women, they are going to pour into you,\u2019\u2019 Parsons said, according to Forbes. \u201cSo, when I walked on this stage, these eyes were watering because they understood the heavy burden that is on all of us in this country.\u2019\u2019\n\nAfter announcing her resignation, Parsons told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and her spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the lawsuit against Fearless was not a motivating factor. But she did not otherwise explain her decision to leave. She also remains an investor in the fund. \u201cAs co-founder, Ayana is still an investor and she has always had multiple ventures centered around inclusion leadership and development, venture capital, and entrepreneurship. Fearless Fund is merely one avenue in her pursuit to be an advocate for the marginalized,\u201d her spokesperson said.\n\nParsons said in her LinkedIn post that she founded the firm \u201cto help change the game for women of color entrepreneurs. And my rationale was simple: women of color are the most founded yet the least funded. They are starting businesses at a faster rate than any other demographic yet lack access to the capital, resources, education and networks needed to scale their businesses.\u201d\n\nShe also promised not to give up on her goal. \u201cI remain steadfast in my support of and commitment to the advancement of women of color,\u201d she said in an emailed statement, mentioning that she\u2019ll soon be publishing a book, too.\n\nStill, as we previously pointed out, the sad fact is that big names in the tech ecosystem have not exactly come out swinging in support. CEO Simone told Inc. earlier this year that the fund had lost nearly all its partnerships aside from two, JPMorgan and Costco. Even Mastercard, who sponsored the now-contested Strivers Grant, has publicly never commented on the lawsuit.\n\nIndeed, support for anything considered DEI has done a complete pendulum swing in tech in 2024, from its height in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd. Currently, it has become more in vogue to publicly pan DEI and praise the so-called meritocracy.\n\nThis story was updated to include statements from Parsons and her public relations representative.", "authors": "['Julie Bort', 'Dominic-Madori Davis']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Kk3VUxfA-e1687456679564.jpg?resize=1200,717", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/fearless-fund-founder-resigned-vc-venture-capital-startups-black-women/", "timestamp": "1719366784.287154", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "The RIAA\u2019s lawsuit against generative music startups will be the bloodbath AI needs", "text": "Like many AI companies, music generation startups Udio and Suno appear to have relied on unauthorized scrapes of copyrighted works in order to train their models. This is by their own and investors\u2019 admission, as well as according to new lawsuits filed against them by music companies. If these suits go before a jury, the trial could be both a damaging expos\u00e9 and a highly useful precedent for similarly sticky-fingered AI companies facing certain legal peril.\n\nThe lawsuits, filed by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), put us all in the uncomfortable position of rooting for the RIAA, which for decades has been the bogeyman of digital media. I myself have received nastygrams from them! The case is simply that clear.\n\nThe gist of the two lawsuits, which are extremely similar in content, is that Suno and Udio (strictly speaking, Uncharted Labs doing business as Udio) indiscriminately pillaged more or less the entire history of recorded music to form datasets, which they then used to train a music-generating AI.\n\nAnd here let us quickly note that these AIs don\u2019t \u201cgenerate\u201d so much as match the user\u2019s prompt to patterns from their training data and then attempt to complete that pattern. In a way, all these models do is perform covers or mashups of the songs they ingested.\n\nThat Suno and Udio did ingest said copyrighted data seems, for all intents and purposes (including legal ones), very likely. The companies\u2019 leadership and investors have been unwisely loose-lipped about the copyright challenges of the space.\n\nThey have admitted that the only way to create a good music generation model is to ingest a large amount of high-quality music. It is very simply a necessary step for creating machine learning models of this type.\n\nThen they said that they did so without the permission of music labels. Investor Antonio Rodriguez of Matrix Partners told Rolling Stone just a few months ago:\n\nHonestly, if we had deals with labels when this company got started, I probably wouldn\u2019t have invested in it. I think that they needed to make this product without the constraints.\n\nThe companies told the RIAA\u2019s lawyers that they believe the media it has ingested falls under fair-use doctrine \u2014 which fundamentally only comes into play in the unauthorized use of a work. Now, fair use is admittedly a complex and hazy concept in idea and execution, but the companies\u2019 use does appear to stray somewhat outside the intended safe harbor of, say, a seventh grader using a Pearl Jam song in the background of their video on global warming.\n\nTo be blunt, it looks like these companies\u2019 goose is cooked. They might have hoped that they could take a page from OpenAI\u2019s playbook, using evasive language and misdirection to stall their less deep-pocketed critics, like authors and journalists. (If by the time AI companies\u2019 skulduggery is revealed and they\u2019re the only option for distribution, it no longer matters.)\n\nBut it\u2019s harder to pull off when there\u2019s a smoking gun in your hand. And unfortunately for Udio and Suno, the RIAA says in its lawsuit that it has a few thousand smoking guns and that songs it owns are clearly being regurgitated by the music models. Its claim: that whether Jackson 5 or Maroon 5, the \u201cgenerated\u201d songs are lightly garbled versions of the originals \u2014 something that would be impossible if the original were not included in the training data.\n\nThe nature of LLMs \u2014 specifically, their tendency to hallucinate and lose the plot the more they write \u2014 precludes regurgitation of, for example, entire books. This has likely mooted a lawsuit by authors against OpenAI, since the latter can plausibly claim the snippets its model does quote were grabbed from reviews, first pages available online and so on. (The latest goalpost move is that they did use copyright works early on but have since stopped, which is funny because it\u2019s like saying you only juiced the orange once but have since stopped.)\n\nWhat you can\u2019t do is plausibly claim that your music generator only heard a few bars of \u201cGreat Balls of Fire\u201d and somehow managed to spit out the rest word for word and chord for chord. Any judge or jury would laugh in your face, and with luck a court artist will have their chance at illustrating that.\n\nThis is not only intuitively obvious but legally consequential as well, as the re-creation of entire works (garbled, but quite obviously based on the originals) opens up a new avenue for relief. If the RIAA can convince the judge that Udio and Suno are doing real and major harm to the business of the copyright holders and artists, it can ask the court to shut down the AI companies\u2019 whole operation at the outset of the trial with an injunction.\n\nOpening paragraphs of your book coming out of an LLM? That\u2019s an intellectual issue to be discussed at length. Dollar-store \u201cCall Me Maybe\u201d generated on demand? Shut it down. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right, but it\u2019s likely.\n\nThe predictable response from the companies has been that the system is not intended to replicate copyrighted works: a desperate, naked attempt to offload liability onto users under Section 230 safe harbor. That is, the same way Instagram isn\u2019t liable if you use a copyrighted song to back your Reel. Here, the argument seems unlikely to gain traction, partly because of the aforementioned admissions that the company itself ignored copyright to begin with.\n\nWhat will be the consequence of these lawsuits? As with all things AI, it\u2019s quite impossible to say ahead of time, since there is little in the way of precedent or applicable, settled doctrine.\n\nMy prediction is that the companies will be forced to expose their training data and methods, these things being of clear evidentiary interest. And if this evidence shows that they are indeed misusing copyrighted material, we\u2019ll see an attempt to settle or avoid trial, and/or a speedy judgment against Udio and Suno. It\u2019s likely that at least one of the two will attempt to continue onward, using legal (or at least legal-adjacent) sources of music, but the resulting model would (by their own standards for training data) almost certainly result in a huge step down in quality, and users would flee.\n\nInvestors? Ideally, they\u2019ll lose their shirts, having placed their bets on something that was in all likelihood illegal and certainly unethical, and not just in the eyes of nebbish author associations but according to the legal minds at the infamously and ruthlessly litigious RIAA.\n\nThe consequences may be far-reaching: If investors in a hot new generative media startup suddenly see a hundred million dollars vaporized due to the fundamental nature of generative media, suddenly a different level of diligence will seem appropriate.\n\nCompanies may learn from the trial or settlement documents what can be said \u2014 or perhaps more importantly, what should not be said \u2014 to avoid liability and keep copyright holders guessing.\n\nThough this particular suit seems almost a foregone conclusion, it will not be a playbook to prosecuting or squeezing settlements out of other generative AI companies but an object lesson in hubris.\n\nIt\u2019s good to have one of those every once in a while, even if the teacher happens to be the RIAA.", "authors": "['Devin Coldewey']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-1495170962.jpg?resize=1200,800", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/the-riaas-lawsuit-against-generative-music-startups-will-be-the-bloodbath-ai-needs/", "timestamp": "1719366800.584994", "displayed": 0}

This week, we\u2019re looking at a Brex exec\u2019s jump to join venture firm a16z, Klarna selling off its payments unit and some mega-raises.\n\nTo get a roundup of TechCrunch\u2019s biggest and most important fintech stories delivered to your inbox every Tuesday at 7:00 a.m. PT, subscribe here.\n\nThe big story\n\nAli Rathod-Papier has stepped down from her role as global head of compliance at corporate card expense management startup Brex to join venture firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) as a partner and compliance officer, TechCrunch exclusively learned. The hiring comes at an interesting time for a16z, which had invested in Synapse, the banking-as-a-service startup that filed for bankruptcy in April and has since been under fire for an estimated $85 million worth of missing customer funds. Another Brex exec, Sam Blond (former chief revenue officer), also left the company to become a venture capitalist. But he ended up stepping down from his role at Founders Fund earlier this year, saying at the time \u201cfull-time investing / being a VC isn\u2019t the right fit for me.\u201d\n\nAnalysis of the week\n\nGynger, a platform that lends capital to companies for technology purchases, has raised $20 million in a Series A round led by PayPal Ventures. There are plenty of companies out there to help startups fund technology purchases through a variety of methods.

The hiring comes at an interesting time for a16z, which had invested in Synapse, the banking-as-a-service startup that filed for bankruptcy in April and has since been under fire for an estimated $85 million worth of missing customer funds. Another Brex exec, Sam Blond (former chief revenue officer), also left the company to become a venture capitalist.

Catering to Gen Z\u2019s demand for video-focused features, the company on Tuesday announced it will now allow users to create short videos of their curated Pinterest boards, designed to be shared on social media.\n\nThe new addition was inspired by the video-sharing activity that was already taking place on apps like TikTok. In 2022, for example, Pinterest introduced a new collage-making app called Shuffles that quickly took off with Gen Z creators on TikTok. The app, still in invite-only mode at the time, went viral as Pinterest users published their so-called \u201caesthetic\u201d collages and mood boards set to music and posted them on TikTok. Later, Shuffles inspired an official Pinterest feature for shoppable collages.\n\nIn addition, Pinterest users have been sharing their boards on apps like TikTok using more-manual methods, like posting screenshots or using the app\u2019s green screen effects to share their curated collections, styles and individuality. Pinterest dubs this type of sharing the \u201cmecore\u201d trend, noting that it has seen a 565% increase in searches related to this activity on its platform annually. Boards titled \u201cmecore\u201d also increased by 255% since last year, it said.\n\nScreenshot Image Credits: Pinterest\n\nWith board sharing, Pinterest users will be able to share their boards in a more creative way on social media. The shared boards will also feature links that, when clicked, bring viewers back to the complete board on Pinterest where they can browse through or shop the collected content. To date, Pinterest users have created more than 10 billion boards.\n\nThe addition may inspire increased social sharing among Gen Z users, who are already drawn to Pinterest, and could serve as a way to increase traffic back to Pinterest\u2019s app by leveraging the viral mechanics of platforms like TikTok and others.\n\nThe company partnered with power users and recording artists Avril Lavigne and Tierra Whack on the launch to showcase the new functionality, while also helping position the feature as a way for creators to reach their fans in new ways.

Stability delivered updates to the open source model and built services around it, eventually commercializing it and growing Stable Diffusion into one of the most widely used open image-generating models today.\n\nStability\u2019s ambitions grew in the subsequent years, and the startup ventured into a number of domains, including code, text, doodle, music, sound, 3D model and video generation and even biomedical research. But the company\u2019s co-founder and ex-CEO, Emad Mostaque, reportedly mismanaged Stability into financial ruin, leading staff to resign, a partnership with Canva to fall through and investors to grow concerned about Stability\u2019s prospects.\n\nStability had just $4 million in the bank last October, per reports \u2014 a far cry from the over $100 million in capital it raised in the proceeding years from investors including Intel \u2014 and was projected to make just $11 million in sales in 2023. Meanwhile, the company was on the hook for $99 million a year for cloud infrastructure rentals from AWS, Google Cloud and CoreWeave to train and run its models and $53 million in operating expenses and wages.\n\nBy December, Stability had pivoted to a subscription model for commercial use of its technology with prices starting at $20 per month.

Key talent including several researchers behind the development of Stable Diffusion, as well as Ed Newton-Rex, who was heading up Stability\u2019s generative AI audio efforts, have left.

Such actions would be a betrayal of the constitution as a whole, the freedom of expression in particular and our own ethos.\u201d\n\nUsers have been reporting interrupted or slow internet connections, with NetBlocks confirming the outage also affected neighboring countries Uganda and Burundi.\n\n\u201cLive network data show a major disruption to internet connectivity in Kenya; the incident comes amidst a deadly crackdown by police on #RejectFinanceBill2024 protesters a day after authorities claimed there would be no internet shutdown. The ongoing internet disruption has impacted Kenya as well as neighboring countries including Uganda and Burundi; the incident is likely to limit coverage of events on the ground where protests are held,\u201d said NetBlocks.\n\nThere was also intermittent access to social media platforms such as X that have been instrumental in bringing protestors together.\n\nProtestors have been using platforms such as X and TikTok to publicize their concerns over the high cost of living, taxation, unwarranted debt accumulation and the rampant misuse of public resources by the political class, among other issues.\n\nProtestors also used social media to call for prudent use of public resources and to get the attention of political leaders. But unable to get leaders to listen, they have taken to the street to get their attention.\n\nThe protestors earlier Tuesday then stormed the parliament moments after lawmakers voted to adopt the bill, resulting in several fatalities and scores of people with injuries. It was then that the internet started to fall over.\n\nSafaricom said on X (formerly Twitter) that the interruption is due to problems with the subsea cable. However, others are reporting that Airtel is working, which would not be the case if the cable was down.\n\nCustomer Notice On Network Outage pic.twitter.com/zgTlsawTPY \u2014 Safaricom PLC (@SafaricomPLC) June 25, 2024\n\nWhen reached for comment about what caused the outage, NetBlocks Director of Research Isik Mater said that it might be due to \u201cunscheduled maintenance\u201d:\n\nWe\u2019ve been tracking those statements. We can look at two factors: the observed impact, and the observed timings. Our observations do indicate that today\u2019s disruption affects multiple countries. However, this outage has much higher impact to Kenya than past confirmed major subsea cable cuts including those earlier this year; we wouldn\u2019t usually expect to see service collapse like this.

{"title": "Internet goes dark in Kenya in the wake of major protests over finance bill", "text": "London-based internet rights monitoring group NetBlocks has reported a major internet disruption in Kenya following a wave of demonstrations across the country, as police violently cracked down on citizens taking to the streets to protest a government bill to hike taxes despite tough economic times and widespread corruption.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Confirmed: Live network data show a major disruption to internet connectivity in #Kenya; the incident comes amidst a deadly crackdown by police on #RejectFinanceBill2024 protesters a day after authorities claimed there would be no internet shutdown \ud83d\udcc9 pic.twitter.com/Umo0NBLGBw \u2014 NetBlocks (@netblocks) June 25, 2024\n\nThe interruption in access comes as the country\u2019s ICT regulator, the Communications Authority, on Monday said it had no plans to shut down or interfere with the internet today.\n\nThe authority in the statement said it \u201chad no intention whatsoever to shut down internet traffic or interfere with the quality of connectivity. Such actions would be a betrayal of the constitution as a whole, the freedom of expression in particular and our own ethos.\u201d\n\nUsers have been reporting interrupted or slow internet connections, with NetBlocks confirming the outage also affected neighboring countries Uganda and Burundi.\n\n\u201cLive network data show a major disruption to internet connectivity in Kenya; the incident comes amidst a deadly crackdown by police on #RejectFinanceBill2024 protesters a day after authorities claimed there would be no internet shutdown. The ongoing internet disruption has impacted Kenya as well as neighboring countries including Uganda and Burundi; the incident is likely to limit coverage of events on the ground where protests are held,\u201d said NetBlocks.\n\nThere was also intermittent access to social media platforms such as X that have been instrumental in bringing protestors together.\n\nProtestors have been using platforms such as X and TikTok to publicize their concerns over the high cost of living, taxation, unwarranted debt accumulation and the rampant misuse of public resources by the political class, among other issues.\n\nProtestors also used social media to call for prudent use of public resources and to get the attention of political leaders. But unable to get leaders to listen, they have taken to the street to get their attention.\n\nThe protestors earlier Tuesday then stormed the parliament moments after lawmakers voted to adopt the bill, resulting in several fatalities and scores of people with injuries. It was then that the internet started to fall over.\n\nSafaricom said on X (formerly Twitter) that the interruption is due to problems with the subsea cable. However, others are reporting that Airtel is working, which would not be the case if the cable was down.\n\nCustomer Notice On Network Outage pic.twitter.com/zgTlsawTPY \u2014 Safaricom PLC (@SafaricomPLC) June 25, 2024\n\nWhen reached for comment about what caused the outage, NetBlocks Director of Research Isik Mater said that it might be due to \u201cunscheduled maintenance\u201d:\n\nWe\u2019ve been tracking those statements. We can look at two factors: the observed impact, and the observed timings. Our observations do indicate that today\u2019s disruption affects multiple countries. However, this outage has much higher impact to Kenya than past confirmed major subsea cable cuts including those earlier this year; we wouldn\u2019t usually expect to see service collapse like this. Further, the other affected countries are downstream to Kenya, so likely affected by the situation in Kenya rather than the other way around. Timings indicate that the outage occurred just around the moment protesters attempted to storm parliament in Nairobi and were met with live rounds by security forces.

{"title": "Apple\u2019s App Store breaches EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act", "text": "A few months after opening a non-compliance case on Apple and the Digital Markets Act (DMA), the European Commission has shared its preliminary findings with Apple. And the bottom line is that the current App Store rules are in breach of the DMA. Confirmed violations of the DMA can lead to fines of up to 10% of global annual turnover.\n\n\u201c\u2018Act different\u2019 should be their new slogan,\u201d the EU\u2019s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, wrote on X. \u201cFor too long, Apple has been squeezing out innovative companies \u2014 denying consumers new opportunities & choices.\u201d\n\nIn this particular case, the European Commission believes third-party developers should be able to inform customers of alternative purchasing possibilities \u2014 free of charge.\n\nFor instance, developers who have released apps on the App Store can\u2019t advertise different prices or alternative distribution channels in their apps. While Apple now allows developers to include a link to their site, the European Commission believes there are too many restrictions with this link-out mechanism.\n\nEven if developers redirect users to their websites and handle transactions on their websites, they have to report transactions to Apple and pay a commission. Apple only waives a 3% payment processing fee for web purchases.\n\n\u201cApple has made a number of changes to comply with the DMA in response to feedback from developers and the European Commission,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe are confident our plan complies with the law, and estimate more than 99% of developers would pay the same or less in fees to Apple under the new business terms we created.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these preliminary findings, the European Commission is opening a third non-compliance investigation into Apple\u2019s new contractual terms for EU developers. This time, the Commission is going to focus on Apple\u2019s controversial Core Technology Fee (CTF) and alternative app marketplaces.\n\nEuropean developers can remain on the standard business terms or choose new business terms that allow them to distribute their apps outside of the App Store. However, these new terms lead to a \u20ac0.50 fee per installed app after one million downloads.\n\nThe company has already adjusted the CTF so that it doesn\u2019t apply to free non-commercial apps. There\u2019s also a three-year transition period for small developers that release a hit app and get more than one million downloads for the first time. But that doesn\u2019t change much in the long term. With this new formal investigation, the EC will determine whether the CTF effectively complies with the DMA.\n\nIf you\u2019ve tried to install a third-party app store in the EU, such as the AltStore, Setapp Mobile or Aptoide, you may have noticed that it requires quite a few taps. You first get an error in your web browser. You have to open the Settings app, accept app installations from this site, go back to your web browser, download the alternative store again, and accept popups about the risks involved with a third-party app store. The EC will examine this \u201cmulti-step user journey\u201d and its compliance with the DMA rules.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that Apple designed its new business model to discourage app developers and end users from taking advantage of the opportunities afforded to them by the DMA,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, the Commission EVP in charge of competition policy, said in a speech.\n\n\u201cThe letter of the DMA is clear: Gatekeepers have to allow for alternative app stores to establish themselves on their platform, and for consumers to be fully informed about the offers available to them so that they can freely choose where they want to source their apps, and at what conditions,\u201d she added.\n\nAs for today\u2019s preliminary findings, Apple can now respond to the European Commission in writing. The final decision is due one year after the opening of the formal investigation, which means that Apple can negotiate with the EU and adjust its business terms once again to avoid a hefty fine.", "authors": "['Romain Dillet']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2112138706.jpg?resize=1200,795", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/24/apples-app-store-breaches-eus-digital-markets-act/", "timestamp": "1719366864.635817", "displayed": 0}
{"title": "Silicon Valley leaders are once again declaring \u2018DEI\u2019 bad and \u2018meritocracy\u2019 good \u2014 but they\u2019re wrong", "text": "No, Silicon Valley, a \u2018meritocracy\u2019 is not better than DEI, according to the data\n\nWho\u2019s afraid of the Big Bad DEI? The acronym is near-poisonous now \u2014 a word that creates almost instant tension between those who embrace it and those who want it dead.\n\nA prime example of this divide was the response to startup Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang\u2019s post on X last week. He wrote about moving away from DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) to instead embrace \u201cMEI\u201d \u2014 merit, excellence, and intelligence.\n\n\u201cScale is a meritocracy, and we must always remain one,\u201d Wang wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal whenever we invite someone to join our mission, and those decisions have never been swayed by orthodoxy or virtue signaling or whatever the current thing is.\u201d\n\nToday we\u2019ve formalized an important hiring policy at Scale. We hire for MEI: merit, excellence, and intelligence.\n\n\n\nThis is the email I\u2019ve shared with our @scale_AI team.\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\nMERITOCRACY AT SCALE\n\n\n\nIn the wake of our fundraise, I\u2019ve been getting a lot of questions\u2026 \u2014 Alexandr Wang (@alexandr_wang) June 13, 2024\n\nThe commenters on X \u2014 which included Elon Musk, Palmer Luckey, and Brian Armstrong \u2014 were thrilled. On LinkedIn, however, the startup community gave a less-than-enthusiastic response. Those commenters pointed out that Wang\u2019s post made it seem as if \u201cmeritocracy\u201d was the definitive benchmark to find qualified hiring candidates \u2014 without taking into consideration that the idea of meritocracy is itself subjective. In the days that have followed the post, more and more people have shared their thoughts and what Wang\u2019s comments reveal about the current state of DEI in tech.\n\n\u201cThe post is misguided because people who support the meritocracy argument are ignoring the structural reasons some groups are more likely to outperform others,\u201d Mutale Nkonde, a founder working in AI policy, told TechCrunch. \u201dWe all want the best people for the job, and there is data to prove that diverse teams are more effective.\u201d\n\nEmily Witko, an HR professional at AI startup Hugging Face, told TechCrunch that the post was a \u201cdangerous oversimplification,\u201d but that it received so much attention on X because it \u201copenly expressed sentiments that are not always expressed publicly and the audience there is hungry to attack DEI.\u201d Wang\u2019s MEI thought \u201cmakes it so easy to refute or criticize any conversations regarding the importance of acknowledging underrepresentation in tech,\u201d she continued.\n\nBut Wang is far from the only Silicon Valley insider to attack DEI in recent months. He joins a chorus of those who feel that DEI programs implemented at businesses over the past several years, peaking with the Black Lives Matter movement, caused a backslide in corporate profitability \u2014 and that a return to \u201cmeritocratic principles\u201d is overdue. Indeed, much of the tech industry has worked to dismantle recruitment programs that considered candidates who, under previous hiring regimes, were often overlooked in the hiring process.\n\nSeeking to make a change, in 2020, many organizations and power players came together to promise more of a focus on DEI, which, contrary to the mainstream discussion, is not simply about hiring someone based on the color of their skin but is about ensuring qualified people from all walks of life \u2014 regardless of skin, gender, or ethnic background \u2014 are better represented and included in recruitment funnels. It\u2019s also about taking a look at disparities and pipeline issues, analyzing the reasoning behind why certain candidates are constantly overlooked in a hiring process.\n\nIn 2023, the U.S. data industry saw new women recruit levels drop by two-thirds, from 36% in 2022 to just 12%, according to a report from HR staffing firm Harnham. Meanwhile, the percentage of Black, Indigenous, and professionals of color in VP or above data roles stood at just 38% in 2022.\n\nAlexandr Wang (pictured above) caused a stir on social media when he posted about meritocracy in tech on X. Image Credits: Drew Angerer / Staff / Getty Images\n\nDEI-related job listings have also fallen out of favor, declining 44% in 2023, according to data from the job site Indeed. In the AI industry, a recent Deloitte survey of women found that over half said they ended up leaving at least one employer because of how men and women were treated differently, while 73% considered leaving the tech industry altogether due to unequal pay and an inability to advance in their careers.\n\nYet, for an industry that prides itself on being data-driven, Silicon Valley cannot let the idea of a meritocracy go \u2014 despite all the data and research showing how such thinking is just a belief system and one that can lead to biased outcomes. The idea of going out and hiring \u201cthe best person for the job\u201d without taking into account any human sociology is how pattern-matching occurs \u2014 teams and companies of people who are alike, when the research has long shown that more diverse teams perform better. Moreover, it has only raised suspicions about who the Valley considers excellent and why.\n\nExperts we spoke to said this subjectiveness revealed other issues with Wang\u2019s missive \u2014 mostly that he presents MEI as a revolutionary idea and not one that Silicon Valley and most of corporate America have long embraced. The acronym \u201cMEI\u201d appears to be a scornful nod to DEI, intended to drive home the notion that a company must choose between hiring diverse candidates or candidates that meet certain \u201cobjective\u201d qualifications.\n\nNatalie Sue Johnson, co-founder of the DEI consulting firm Paradigm, told TechCrunch that research has shown meritocracy to be a paradox and that organizations that focus too much on it actually see an increase in bias. \u201cIt frees people up from thinking that they have to try hard to be fair in their decision-making,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey think that meritocracy is inherent, not something that needs to be achieved.\u201d\n\nAs Nkonde mentioned, Johnson noted that Wang\u2019s approach doesn\u2019t acknowledge that underrepresented groups face systemic barriers society is still struggling to address. Ironically, the most meritorious person could be the one who has achieved a skill set for a job despite such barriers that may have influenced their educational background or prevented them from filling their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with the kind of college internships that impresses Silicon Valley.\n\nTreating a person as a faceless, nameless candidate, without understanding their unique experiences, and therefore their employability, is a mistake, Johnson said. \u201cThere is nuance.\u201d\n\nWitko added to that: \u201cA meritocratic system is built on criteria that reflect the status quo, and therefore, it will perpetuate existing inequalities by continuously favoring those who already have advantages.\u201d\n\nTo be somewhat charitable to Wang, given how acidic the term DEI has become, developing a new term that still represents the value of fairness to all candidates, isn\u2019t a terrible idea \u2014 even if \u201cmeritocracy\u201d is misguided. And his post suggests that Scale AI\u2019s values could align with the spirit of diversity, equity, and inclusion even if he might not realize it, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cCasting a wide net for talent and making objective hiring decisions that do not disadvantage candidates based on identity is exactly what diversity, equity, and inclusion work seeks to do,\u201d she explained.\n\nBut again, where Wang undermines this is endorsing the mistaken belief that meritocracy will produce outcomes based on one\u2019s abilities and merits alone.\n\nPerhaps it is all a paradox. If one looks at Scale AI\u2019s treatment of its data annotators \u2014 many of whom live in economically depressed countries and scrape by on little pay \u2014 it suggests the company has scant real interest in disrupting the status quo.\n\nScale AI\u2019s annotators work on tasks for multiple eight-hour workdays \u2014 no breaks \u2014 for pay ranging as low as $10 (per the Verge and NY Mag). It\u2019s on the backs of these annotators that Scale AI has built a business worth over $13 billion and with more than $1.6 billion in cash in the bank.\n\nWhen asked for comment on the allegations made in the Verge and NY Mag piece, a spokesperson pointed to this blog post, in which it described its human annotator jobs as \u201cgig work.\u201d The spokesperson didn\u2019t address TechCrunch\u2019s request for clarification on Scale AI\u2019s MEI policy.\n\nJohnson said Wang\u2019s post is a great example of the box many leaders and companies find themselves trapped in.\n\nShe pondered, can they trust that having meritocratic ideals is enough to lead to truly meritocratic outcomes, and promote diversity?\n\n\u201cOr,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cdo they acknowledge that ideals are not enough, and to truly build more diverse workforces where everyone has the same access to opportunities and can do their best work requires intention?\u201d", "authors": "['Dominic-Madori Davis', 'Kyle Wiggers']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DEI-big-bad-wolf.jpg?resize=1200,645", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/23/silicon-valley-leaders-are-once-again-declaring-dei-bad-and-meritocracy-good-but-theyre-wrong/", "timestamp": "1719366866.000384", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "iOS 18 could \u2018sherlock\u2019 $400M in app revenue", "text": "Apple\u2019s practice of leveraging ideas from its third-party developer community to become new iOS and Mac features and apps has a hefty price tag, a new report indicates. With the release of iOS 18 later this fall, Apple\u2019s changes may affect apps that today have an estimated $393 million in revenue and have been downloaded roughly 58 million times over the past year, according to an analysis by app intelligence firm Appfigures.\n\nEvery June at Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference, the iPhone maker teases the upcoming releases of its software and operating systems, which often include features previously only available through third-party apps. The practice is so common now it\u2019s even been given a name: \u201csherlocking\u201d \u2014 a reference to a 1990s search app for Mac that borrowed features from a third-party app known as Watson. Now when Apple launches a new feature that was before the domain of a third-party app, it\u2019s said to have \u201csherlocked\u201d the app.\n\nIn earlier years, sherlocking apps made some sense. After all, did the iPhone\u2019s flashlight really need to be a third-party offering, or would it be better as a built-in function? Plus, Apple has been able to launch features that made its software better adapted to consumers\u2019 wants and needs by looking at what\u2019s popular among the third-party developer community.\n\nOf course, this practice also raises the question as to whether Apple is leveraging proprietary data to make its determinations about what to build next, and whether the apps it competes with are being offered an even playing field. For example, before Apple launched its own parental controls system, it shut down many third-party apps that had built businesses in this space by saying their solutions were now noncompliant with its rules and policies. The apps weren\u2019t offered access to a developer API for managing Apple\u2019s built-in parental controls for years, prompting an antitrust investigation.\n\nIn more recent years, Apple has \u201csherlocked\u201d third parties with launches of features like Continuity Camera, medication tracking, sleep tracking and mood tracking, as well as apps like Freeform and Journal. This year, it turned its attention to password managers, call recording and transcription apps, those for making custom emoji, AI-powered writing tools and math helpers, trail apps and more.\n\nIn an analysis of third-party apps that generated more than 1,000 downloads per year, Appfigures discovered several genres that had found themselves in Apple\u2019s crosshairs in 2024.\n\nIn terms of worldwide gross revenue, these categories have generated significant income over the past 12 months, with the trail app category making the most at $307 million per year, led by market leader and 2023 Apple \u201cApp of the Year\u201d AllTrails. Grammar helper apps, like Grammarly and others, also generated $35.7 million, while math helpers and password managers earned $23.4 million and $20.3 million, respectively. Apps for making custom emoji generated $7 million, too.\n\nImage Credits: Appfigures\n\nOf these, trail apps accounted for the vast majority of \u201cpotentially sherlocked\u201d revenue, or 78%, noted Appfigures, as well as 40% of downloads of sherlocked apps. In May 2024, they accounted for an estimated $28.8 million in gross consumer spending and 2.5 million downloads, to give you an idea of scale.\n\nMany of these app categories were growing quickly, with math solvers having seen revenue growth of 43% year-over-year followed by grammar helpers (+40%), password managers (+38%) and trail apps (+28%). Emoji-making apps, however, were seeing declines at -17% year-over-year.\n\nImage Credits: Appfigures\n\nBy downloads, grammar helpers had seen 9.4 million installs over the past 12 months, followed by emoji makers (10.6 million), math-solving apps (9.5 million) and password managers (457,000 installs).\n\nAlthough these apps certainly have dedicated user bases that may not immediately choose to switch to a first-party offering, Apple\u2019s ability to offer similar functionality built-in could be detrimental to their potential growth. Casual users may be satisfied by Apple\u2019s \u201cgood enough\u201d solutions and won\u2019t seek out alternatives.\n\nHowever, apps that continue to develop new features and add enhancements beyond what Apple includes while also taking advantage of other new ways to reach users, like through Apple\u2019s improved Siri, may have a better shot than others.", "authors": "['Sarah Perez']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/app-store-2024-v1.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/18/ios-18-could-sherlock-400m-in-app-revenue/", "timestamp": "1719366868.9821591", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "ChatGPT: Everything you need to know about the AI chatbot", "text": "ChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to hyper-charge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth used by more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies.\n\nThat growth has propelled OpenAI itself into becoming one of the most-hyped companies in recent memory. And its latest partnership with Apple for its upcoming generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, has given the company another significant bump in the AI race.\n\n2024 also saw the release of GPT-4o, OpenAI\u2019s new flagship omni model for ChatGPT. GPT-4o is now the default free model, complete with voice and vision capabilities. But after demoing GPT-4o, OpenAI paused one of its voices, Sky, after allegations that it was mimicking Scarlett Johansson\u2019s voice in \u201cHer.\u201d\n\nOpenAI is facing internal drama, including the sizable exit of co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever as the company dissolved its Superalignment team. OpenAI is also facing a lawsuit from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers, including the New York Daily News and the Chicago Tribune, for alleged copyright infringement, following a similar suit filed by The New York Times last year.\n\nHere\u2019s a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we\u2019ve been updating throughout the year.

Features exclusive to paying ChatGPT users will also be available through Apple devices.\n\nApple is bringing ChatGPT to Siri and other first-party apps and capabilities across its operating systems #WWDC24\n\n\n\nRead more: https://t.co/0NJipSNJoS pic.twitter.com/EjQdPBuyy4 \u2014 TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) June 10, 2024\n\nHouse Oversight subcommittee invites Scarlett Johansson to testify about \u2018Sky\u2019 controversy\n\nScarlett Johansson has been invited to testify about the controversy surrounding OpenAI\u2019s Sky voice at a hearing for the House Oversight Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation.

This version of ChatGPT will have \u201cslightly more restrictive content policies,\u201d according to OpenAI. When TechCrunch asked for more details, however, the response was unclear:\n\n\u201cThe signed out experience will benefit from the existing safety mitigations that are already built into the model, such as refusing to generate harmful content. In addition to these existing mitigations, we are also implementing additional safeguards specifically designed to address other forms of content that may be inappropriate for a signed out experience,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\nMarch 2024\n\nOpenAI\u2019s chatbot store is filling up with spam\n\nTechCrunch found that the OpenAI\u2019s GPT Store is flooded with bizarre, potentially copyright-infringing GPTs.

How does it work?\n\nChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.\n\nWhen did ChatGPT get released?\n\nNovember 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.\n\nWhat is the latest version of ChatGPT?\n\nBoth the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.\n\nCan I use ChatGPT for free?\n\nThere is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.\n\nWho uses ChatGPT?\n\nAnyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.\n\nWhat companies use ChatGPT?\n\nMultiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.\n\nMost recently, Microsoft announced at it\u2019s 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.\n\nWhat does GPT mean in ChatGPT?\n\nGPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.\n\nWhat is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?\n\nA chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they\u2019ll give canned responses to questions.\n\nChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.\n\nCan ChatGPT write essays?\n\nYes.\n\nCan ChatGPT commit libel?\n\nDue to the nature of how these models work, they don\u2019t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That\u2019s a problem when you\u2019re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn\u2019t commit, that may well at this point be libel.\n\nWe will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.\n\nDoes ChatGPT have an app?\n\nYes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.\n\nWhat is the ChatGPT character limit?\n\nIt\u2019s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.\n\nDoes ChatGPT have an API?\n\nYes, it was released March 1, 2023.\n\nWhat are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?\n\nEveryday examples include programing, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.\n\nWhat are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?\n\nAdvanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.\n\nHow good is ChatGPT at writing code?\n\nIt depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can\u2019t necessarily program an entire app\u2019s worth of code. That\u2019s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness \u2014 in other words, the generated code isn\u2019t always appropriate for the specific context in which it\u2019s being used.\n\nCan you save a ChatGPT chat?\n\nYes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.\n\nAre there alternatives to ChatGPT?\n\nYes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google\u2019s Gemini and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.\n\nHow does ChatGPT handle data privacy?\n\nOpenAI has said that individuals in \u201ccertain jurisdictions\u201d (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression \u201cin accordance with applicable laws\u201d.\n\nThe web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled \u201cOpenAI Personal Data Removal Request\u201d.\n\nIn its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on \u201clegitimate interest\u201d (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out \u2014 when it writes: \u201cSee here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.\u201d\n\nWhat controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?\n\nRecently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI\u2019s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.\n\nAn Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT\u2019s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.\n\nCNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.\n\nSeveral major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.\n\nThere have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.\n\nWhere can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?\n\nSeveral marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.\n\nCan ChatGPT be detected?\n\nPoorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they\u2019re inconsistent at best.\n\nAre ChatGPT chats public?\n\nNo. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users\u2019 conversations to other people on the service.\n\nWhat lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?\n\nNone specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.\n\nAre there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?\n\nYes.

{"title": "The 29 Best Shows on Apple TV+ Right Now", "text": "Slowly but surely, Apple TV+ is finding its feet. The streaming service, which at launch we called \u201codd, angsty, and horny as hell,\u201d has evolved into a diverse library of dramas, documentaries, and comedies. Now, its library is so packed, we\u2019ve declared it \u201cthe new HBO.\u201d\n\nCurious but don\u2019t know where to get started? Below are our picks for the best shows on the service. (Also, here are our picks for the best movies on Apple TV+.) When you\u2019re done, head over to our guides to the best shows on Netflix, best movies on Hulu, and best movies on Amazon Prime, because you can never have too much television.\n\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more.\n\nPresumed Innocent\n\nJust to be clear, this whodunit has been done before. Thirty-four years ago, Harrison Ford starred in the film adaptation of Scott Turow\u2019s novel. This time around, the lead is played by Jake Gyllenhaal, and the adaptation is an eight-part limited series, not a film. Gyllenhaal stars as Rusty Sabich, a Chicago prosecutor accused of killing a colleague. A colleague with whom he was having an affair. The series is produced by David E. Kelley, so it has the intrigue and glossiness of his recent offerings like Big Little Lies and The Undoing, as well as the darkness and drama.\n\nSunny\n\nSunny comes at an interesting time. It\u2019s the story of a woman named Suzie (Rashida Jones) whose husband and son are lost in a mysterious plane crash. To work through her grief, Suzie is given Sunny, a domestic robot with whom she forms a unique bond as she begins to uncover what happened to her family. As artificial intelligence gets more and more ingrained in everyone\u2019s lives, Sunny promises to hit differently than it would at any other time. The first two episodes drop on July 10, with the remaining eight rolling out every Wednesday through September.\n\nSTEVE! (martin) A Documentary in 2 Pieces\n\nPutting this on the \u201cbest shows on Apple TV+\u201d list is a bit of a cheat. Rather than a series, this two-part documentary is more like a pair of movies looking at the life and career of Steve Martin. The first part chronicles his rise in, and reimagining of, the standup comedy world. The second looks at how he went from that to the neurotic and lovable neighbor he currently plays on Only Murders in the Building, which would be his career\u2019s triumphant second act if he hadn\u2019t had something like 30 acts in between. Directed by Morgan Neville, who made the backup singer documentary 20 Feet From Stardom and the Fred Rogers doc Won\u2019t You Be My Neighbor?, it\u2019s funny, intimate, and a little surprising\u2014just like Martin himself.\n\nLoot\n\nOK, so Loot isn't exactly about MacKenzie Scott's divorce from Jeff Bezos, but it is about a woman named Molly (Maya Rudolph) who separates from her tech billionaire husband and devotes herself to philanthropic work. Also, creators Alan Yang (Master of None) and Matt Hubbard (Superstore) were kind of inspired by Bezos and Scott's split. With an incredible supporting cast that includes Joel Kim Booster, Michaela Ja\u00e9 Rodriguez, and Adam Scott, it's a quirky comedy with a lot of heart\u2014and the kind of thing you (probably) won't see on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nThe Big Door Prize\n\nWith The Big Door Prize Chris O'Dowd finally got the \u201cguy leading a show\u201d role he was always meant for. In the series, he plays a 40-year-old high school teacher named Dusty who's pretty content with his life until a magic machine shows up in his small town. The machine, you see, tells people their life's potential, and as soon as people around him start using it, everything changes. Marriages end, paths divert, and eventually Dusty must confront whether he's happy in his own life. Season 2 of the series, which launched in spring 2024, explores what happens after everyone upends their lives.\n\nThe Completely Made-Up Adventures of Dick Turpin\n\nDick Turpin was a real highwayman in 18th-century England who was ultimately executed for horse theft. But the myths surrounding him are far more interesting than the facts. The Completely Made-Up Adventures of Dick Turpin, true to its name, opts to stick with the fun stuff. Starring Noel Fielding (The Great British Bake Off) in the title role, this six-episode series presents Turpin as someone who stumbled into leading a group of outlaws and made the best of it. Enjoy the ride.\n\nConstellation\n\nAround here we have a theory that Apple TV+ is the new HBO. At the same time, we also wonder among ourselves whether it\u2019s the new Syfy. After opening with a bang in 2019 with For All Mankind, it has released a steady drumbeat of trippy, spacey, timey-wimey prestige shows, from Foundation to Severance. In early 2024, it released Constellation, an eight-part thriller about an astronaut (Noomi Rapace) who returns to Earth after a disaster in space to find things are very off. Brain-bending and tense, it\u2019s the kind of sci-fi that sucks you in. Get lost.\n\nMasters of the Air\n\nGenerally speaking, \u201cWorld War II drama\u201d and Steven Spielberg is probably enough to get anyone to click Play on this series, but it\u2019s got a lot more than just a good elevator pitch. Based on Donald L. Miller\u2019s Masters of the Air, this series dives deep into the lives of the 100th Bomb Group\u2014aka the \u201cBloody Hundredth\u201d\u2014a group of pilots tasked with risking their lives to fight Nazi Germany from the air. Spielberg and Tom Hanks serve as executive producers, and the cast features Elvis himself, Austin Butler, as well as Saltburn\u2019s Barry Keoghan and Doctor Who\u2019s new Doctor, Ncuti Gatwa.\n\nThe New Look\n\nKeeping with the World War II theme, The New Look follows Christian Dior, Coco Chanel, Pierre Balmain, and Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga as they lay the path for modern fashion in Nazi-occupied Paris. The cast features Ben Mendelsohn as Christian Dior, Juliette Binoche as Coco Chanel, and Maisie Williams as Catherine Dior, and also has a soundtrack courtesy of Jack Antonoff that\u2019s chock full of early 20th-century music covered by the likes of Perfume Genius and Florence Welch.\n\nCriminal Record\n\nApple TV+\u2019s dramas are on a hot streak lately. Now that stellar series like For All Mankind and Slow Horses are finally getting audiences, the streamer is putting more in their queues with Criminal Record. Starring former Doctor Who Doctor Peter Capaldi, the crime drama follows two cops\u2014Capaldi\u2019s Daniel Hegarty and Cush Jumbo\u2019s June Lenker\u2014as they try to get to the bottom of a long-settled case. Daniel worked the case originally and got a confession; June got a fresh tip and wants him to reopen it and find out whether the man who went away for murder is actually innocent. Might sound a bit overdone, but the series also works in elements of law enforcement shortcomings and race in a rapidly-changing Britain for a series that\u2019s about more than just one case.\n\nHijack\n\nThere\u2019s this face Idris Elba does. He\u2019s been perfecting it since he was Stringer Bell on The Wire. It\u2019s the look of total calm even when he\u2019s talking about the most harrowing thing you can imagine. That face gets a full workout in Hijack, in which Elba plays a corporate negotiator who finds himself trying to settle things with a group of, yes, hijackers who have taken over the flight he\u2019s boarded to get home to his family. This series is seven episodes, roughly seven hours\u2014the same length of the flight, and it follows the drama in the air and the political maneuvering below before attempting to stick the landing. Do stay around until the end.\n\nFor All Mankind\n\nLong before Foundation, there was For All Mankind. The show not only set the tone for the kind of glossy prestige sci-fi Apple TV+ had ambitions to make, but it was also the streaming service's attempt to plant its flag in the realm of streaming giants. A solid slice of alternate history, the show starts with a very smart premise: What if the US had been edged out in putting a man on the moon? How would the space-race rivalry between the Americans and the Soviets have played out? It's mostly a slick, stylish, NASA-heavy period drama, but as this is from the brain of Ronald D. Moore, there are a few standout moments and episodes with attention shared around the large ensemble cast. It might be the best sci-fi show you're not watching, and if that's true you now have multiple seasons to catch up on.\n\nMessi Meets America\n\nIf your home screen hasn't made it obvious, Apple TV+ is super stoked about soccer these days. Messi Meets America is a six-part docuseries about all-star player Lionel Messi's move to Major League Soccer's Inter Miami club. The first three episodes aired on October 11, 2023, and subsequent episodes aired in conjunction with last year's MLS season. Messi Mania, indeed.\n\nLessons in Chemistry\n\nBased on the debut novel from science writer Bonnie Garmus, Lessons in Chemistry is the story of Elizabeth Zott (Brie Larson), who gets hired to host a cooking show after she's fired from the lab she was working in for doing science while female. Obviously, the show Elizabeth puts on ends up being about a lot more than just having dinner on the table at 6 pm, but we suggest you watch to find out just how revolutionary it is.\n\nThe Morning Show\n\nEvery streaming service needs a flashy mainstream drama with Hollywood heavyweights to pull in viewers. Apple TV+ has The Morning Show. When Alex Levy (Jennifer Aniston) loses her morning news program cohost Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell) following sexual misconduct accusations, she gets paired up with Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon). What unfolds is a #MeToo-era drama full of TV network intrigue and Sorkin-lite dialog. In its second season, it went deep on Covid-19, and in the third season the series' fictional network, UBA, finds itself dealing with the aftermath of a cyberattack. There's likely a new season coming in 2025, so now's a good time to catch up, or go back and refresh your memory.\n\nShining Girls\n\nThis Elisabeth Moss psychological thriller/murder mystery came out in 2022 and never really got the buzz it likely deserved. All of that to say, you should probably watch it if you haven't already. Moss plays Kirby, a woman who believes a recent Chicago murder may be linked to an attack on her many years prior. She teams with a Sun-Times reporter to investigate, but the deeper she digs the more her own reality starts to shift. Based on the book The Shining Girls by Lauren Beukes, this series may seem like just another murder mystery, but its sci-fi twists put it one step ahead.\n\nFoundation\n\nWIRED called Foundation a \u201cflawed masterpiece\u201d in our review of the first season. Considering the complexities of adapting a sprawling Isaac Asimov book series, it was high praise. Starring Jared Harris as Hari Seldon, a math professor who, along with his loyal followers, is exiled for predicting the oncoming end of the galactic empire that rules over them, the show often suffers under the weight of its own massive scope. But it also features wonderful performances from Lee Pace and beautiful images inspired by the James Webb Space Telescope. If you have a soft spot for big sci-fi dramas, this Game-of-Thrones-in-space wannabe is a must-watch.\n\nThe Crowded Room\n\nSet in the late 1970s, The Crowded Room stars Tom Holland as Danny Sullivan, a young man arrested after a grisly shooting in New York City. Following his arrest, this 10-episode limited series unfolds into a twisty whodunit as interrogator Rya Goodwin (Amanda Seyfried) tries to suss out what happened with the shooting and the peculiar events in Sullivan\u2019s past that may have shaped how he ended up involved. Holland told Extra that the shoot for The Crowded Room, which he also produced, \u201cbroke\u201d him, leading to him taking a yearlong hiatus from acting. Want to see why? Watch now.\n\nSilo\n\nAs WIRED's Kate Knibbs noted in the wake of Silo's release, this show is prestige sci-fi gold. Based on a dystopian book trilogy by Hugh Howey, the series focuses on a subterranean bunker\u2014the silo of the title\u2014where humanity has sequestered itself after the apocalypse. Some are hoping to win the chance to reproduce, some are trying to solve mysterious murders. Everyone watching is enjoying figuring out what's going on in this underground city\u2014and what's happening outside of it.\n\nTed Lasso\n\nOn paper, Ted Lasso sounds terrible. The inconceivable story of an American football coach who has never watched a game of soccer somehow landing himself a job as coach of a (fictional) Premier League club and trying to make up for his total lack of qualifications by being a nice guy. Sounds unwatchable, doesn\u2019t it? And yet Ted Lasso has captured the hearts and minds of viewers on both sides of the pond with its large-as-life cast and irresistibly wholesome messaging, hoovering up awards in the process. The third and final season his the streamer last year, so now is the perfect time to binge it all.\n\nHigh Desert\n\nThe Patricia Arquette\u2013aissance doesn\u2019t get as much ink as Matthew McConaughey or Keanu Reeves did during their second comings, but it\u2019s here\u2014in part thanks to the rise of streaming. Between The Act and Severance, Arquette has received some of the highest accolades of her long career recently, and High Desert is no exception. While coming to terms with the death of her mother, Peggy (Arquette)\u2014an addict\u2014decides she wants to pick up the pieces of her life and become a private investigator. She finds an unwitting employer/sometime mentor in Bruce Harvey (Brad Garrett), but not everyone is onboard with Peggy\u2019s career decisions\u2014namely, her straitlaced sister (Christine Taylor). It\u2019s an odd duck of a show, which is perfectly suited to Arquette\u2019s ethereal acting style, allowing her to seamlessly flit between moments of tragedy and laugh-out-loud comedy, with the audiences doing their best to keep up. The all-star cast is made even more impressive by recurring appearances from Bernadette Peters as Peggy\u2019s late mom.\n\nBig Beasts\n\nLook, Discovery doesn't get to corner the market on animal documentaries\u2014and this 10-part docuseries proves it. Featuring elephant seals, brown bears, orangutans, giant otters, and all kinds of massive mammals in between, it's the perfect thing if you just want to escape and learn a few tidbits about nature. But the best part? It's narrated by Tom Hiddleston, and there's just something charming about hearing the voice of Loki talk about a bunch of different animals he could turn himself into in the blink of an eye.\n\nShrinking\n\nDo you enjoy In Treatment but wish it was, you know, fun? Then Shrinking may be right for you. Created by Bill Lawrence and Brett Goldstein\u2014of Ted Lasso fame\u2014and Jason Segel, the show is about Jimmy (Segel), a therapist struggling to get over the death of his wife and reconnect with his daughter and patients. That may sound like a downer, and the show isn\u2019t without its harder moments, but it\u2019s buoyed by the fact that it\u2019s also a workplace comedy focusing on the therapy practice where Jimmy works alongside Harrison Ford\u2019s Paul and Jessica Williams\u2019 Gaby. Shrinking, ultimately, is about the things people do to cope, but it also features a dream team of a cast and one very memorable party scene featuring an (unrelated) vomit-soaked piano and a super-stoned Ford.\n\nServant\n\nCinematically, M. Night Shyamalan can be a little hit-or-miss, but Servant, which the filmmaker executive produces and occasionally directs, is stellar. It's about a Philadelphia couple\u2014a chef and a news anchor\u2014who lose a child only to have it mysteriously come back to life (maybe) with the arrival of their new nanny. (You really just need to watch the show for any of this to make sense.) Moody, freaky, and occasionally even funny, it'll suck you in. And now that it wrapped its fourth and final season, there\u2019s plenty to enjoy.\n\nThe Essex Serpent\n\nClaire Danes doing her best trembling-chin acting in period garb, Tom Hiddleston as a town vicar, rumors about a mysterious mythological serpent\u2014is there anything not to love about this show? No, there\u2019s not. The Essex Serpent, based on the novel by Sarah Perry, follows a recent widow (Danes) as she heads to the countryside in Essex to investigate a \u201csea dragon.\u201d There, she meets a vicar, Will (Hiddleston), who is far more skeptical of the serpent\u2019s existence. Lush and inviting, it\u2019s the ideal period mystery.\n\nSeverance\n\nOut of all the shows on this list, Severance may be the one that firmly established Apple TV+ as a streaming player with edgy prestige content. Adam Scott plays Mark, a man distraught by the death of his wife who opts to undergo Severance, a procedure that divides his memories of work from those of his life at home. He\u2019s quite happy with the setup until a former Lumon Industries coworker tracks him down when he\u2019s out-of-office, setting off a series of events that makes him question not only Severance but the work his company does. From there, it only gets more weird and bleak with each passing minute. Tense and heartbreaking, this show, the bulk of which was directed by Ben Stiller, will keep you guessing and questioning the whole way through.\n\nLittle America\n\nOriginally released when Donald Trump was still president of the United States, Little America was and remains a timely reminder of what actually makes America great. Each episode of this anthology series focuses on a different story of immigrants living in America. From an undocumented high school student who discovers a talent for squash to a \u201cbra whisperer\u201d in Brooklyn, every one of these 30-minute vignettes\u2014all of them based on real people\u2014is inspiring and important viewing.\n\nMythic Quest\n\nAn all-too-rare example of a video game TV show that really works, Mythic Quest is one of the best new workplace comedies of the past few years. Presented in perfectly bingeable half-hour episodes, the show follows a fictional game studio known for its World of Warcraft\u2013like MMO, Mythic Quest, as the people who make it slalom through their many quirky relationships. The writing is excellent, consistently funny and emotionally impactful when you least expect it, and the show manages to confront real issues in the industry without sacrificing laughs.\n\nDickinson\n\nHailee Steinfeld is a riotous young Emily Dickinson in this half-hour show from creator Alena Smith. It was part of the original Apple TV+ lineup and quickly distinguished itself thanks to its off-kilter vision of 19th-century Amherst, Massachusetts. The first season is a set of sharp, surreal vignettes, inspired by Dickinson's work and tracing the imagined life of the young poet, who is rebelling against her father, the town's societal rules, and just about everything else. The second and third seasons go deeper, examining not only the poet's life, but also the roles that race, gender, sexuality, and class played in the early days of America. If you're a Dickinson stan, love a bit of smart queer dramedy, or just have a penchant for a modern soundtrack in a Civil War\u2013era show, you\u2019ll dig this.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast', 'Angela Watercutter', 'Wired Staff', 'Eric Ravenscraft', 'Jennifer M.

{"title": "The 29 Best Shows on Apple TV+ Right Now", "text": "Slowly but surely, Apple TV+ is finding its feet. The streaming service, which at launch we called \u201codd, angsty, and horny as hell,\u201d has evolved into a diverse library of dramas, documentaries, and comedies. Now, its library is so packed, we\u2019ve declared it \u201cthe new HBO.\u201d\n\nCurious but don\u2019t know where to get started? Below are our picks for the best shows on the service. (Also, here are our picks for the best movies on Apple TV+.) When you\u2019re done, head over to our guides to the best shows on Netflix, best movies on Hulu, and best movies on Amazon Prime, because you can never have too much television.\n\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more.\n\nPresumed Innocent\n\nJust to be clear, this whodunit has been done before. Thirty-four years ago, Harrison Ford starred in the film adaptation of Scott Turow\u2019s novel. This time around, the lead is played by Jake Gyllenhaal, and the adaptation is an eight-part limited series, not a film. Gyllenhaal stars as Rusty Sabich, a Chicago prosecutor accused of killing a colleague. A colleague with whom he was having an affair. The series is produced by David E. Kelley, so it has the intrigue and glossiness of his recent offerings like Big Little Lies and The Undoing, as well as the darkness and drama.\n\nSunny\n\nSunny comes at an interesting time. It\u2019s the story of a woman named Suzie (Rashida Jones) whose husband and son are lost in a mysterious plane crash. To work through her grief, Suzie is given Sunny, a domestic robot with whom she forms a unique bond as she begins to uncover what happened to her family. As artificial intelligence gets more and more ingrained in everyone\u2019s lives, Sunny promises to hit differently than it would at any other time. The first two episodes drop on July 10, with the remaining eight rolling out every Wednesday through September.\n\nSTEVE! (martin) A Documentary in 2 Pieces\n\nPutting this on the \u201cbest shows on Apple TV+\u201d list is a bit of a cheat. Rather than a series, this two-part documentary is more like a pair of movies looking at the life and career of Steve Martin. The first part chronicles his rise in, and reimagining of, the standup comedy world. The second looks at how he went from that to the neurotic and lovable neighbor he currently plays on Only Murders in the Building, which would be his career\u2019s triumphant second act if he hadn\u2019t had something like 30 acts in between. Directed by Morgan Neville, who made the backup singer documentary 20 Feet From Stardom and the Fred Rogers doc Won\u2019t You Be My Neighbor?, it\u2019s funny, intimate, and a little surprising\u2014just like Martin himself.\n\nLoot\n\nOK, so Loot isn't exactly about MacKenzie Scott's divorce from Jeff Bezos, but it is about a woman named Molly (Maya Rudolph) who separates from her tech billionaire husband and devotes herself to philanthropic work. Also, creators Alan Yang (Master of None) and Matt Hubbard (Superstore) were kind of inspired by Bezos and Scott's split. With an incredible supporting cast that includes Joel Kim Booster, Michaela Ja\u00e9 Rodriguez, and Adam Scott, it's a quirky comedy with a lot of heart\u2014and the kind of thing you (probably) won't see on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nThe Big Door Prize\n\nWith The Big Door Prize Chris O'Dowd finally got the \u201cguy leading a show\u201d role he was always meant for. In the series, he plays a 40-year-old high school teacher named Dusty who's pretty content with his life until a magic machine shows up in his small town. The machine, you see, tells people their life's potential, and as soon as people around him start using it, everything changes. Marriages end, paths divert, and eventually Dusty must confront whether he's happy in his own life. Season 2 of the series, which launched in spring 2024, explores what happens after everyone upends their lives.\n\nThe Completely Made-Up Adventures of Dick Turpin\n\nDick Turpin was a real highwayman in 18th-century England who was ultimately executed for horse theft. But the myths surrounding him are far more interesting than the facts. The Completely Made-Up Adventures of Dick Turpin, true to its name, opts to stick with the fun stuff. Starring Noel Fielding (The Great British Bake Off) in the title role, this six-episode series presents Turpin as someone who stumbled into leading a group of outlaws and made the best of it. Enjoy the ride.\n\nConstellation\n\nAround here we have a theory that Apple TV+ is the new HBO. At the same time, we also wonder among ourselves whether it\u2019s the new Syfy. After opening with a bang in 2019 with For All Mankind, it has released a steady drumbeat of trippy, spacey, timey-wimey prestige shows, from Foundation to Severance. In early 2024, it released Constellation, an eight-part thriller about an astronaut (Noomi Rapace) who returns to Earth after a disaster in space to find things are very off. Brain-bending and tense, it\u2019s the kind of sci-fi that sucks you in. Get lost.\n\nMasters of the Air\n\nGenerally speaking, \u201cWorld War II drama\u201d and Steven Spielberg is probably enough to get anyone to click Play on this series, but it\u2019s got a lot more than just a good elevator pitch. Based on Donald L. Miller\u2019s Masters of the Air, this series dives deep into the lives of the 100th Bomb Group\u2014aka the \u201cBloody Hundredth\u201d\u2014a group of pilots tasked with risking their lives to fight Nazi Germany from the air. Spielberg and Tom Hanks serve as executive producers, and the cast features Elvis himself, Austin Butler, as well as Saltburn\u2019s Barry Keoghan and Doctor Who\u2019s new Doctor, Ncuti Gatwa.\n\nThe New Look\n\nKeeping with the World War II theme, The New Look follows Christian Dior, Coco Chanel, Pierre Balmain, and Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga as they lay the path for modern fashion in Nazi-occupied Paris. The cast features Ben Mendelsohn as Christian Dior, Juliette Binoche as Coco Chanel, and Maisie Williams as Catherine Dior, and also has a soundtrack courtesy of Jack Antonoff that\u2019s chock full of early 20th-century music covered by the likes of Perfume Genius and Florence Welch.\n\nCriminal Record\n\nApple TV+\u2019s dramas are on a hot streak lately. Now that stellar series like For All Mankind and Slow Horses are finally getting audiences, the streamer is putting more in their queues with Criminal Record. Starring former Doctor Who Doctor Peter Capaldi, the crime drama follows two cops\u2014Capaldi\u2019s Daniel Hegarty and Cush Jumbo\u2019s June Lenker\u2014as they try to get to the bottom of a long-settled case. Daniel worked the case originally and got a confession; June got a fresh tip and wants him to reopen it and find out whether the man who went away for murder is actually innocent. Might sound a bit overdone, but the series also works in elements of law enforcement shortcomings and race in a rapidly-changing Britain for a series that\u2019s about more than just one case.\n\nHijack\n\nThere\u2019s this face Idris Elba does. He\u2019s been perfecting it since he was Stringer Bell on The Wire. It\u2019s the look of total calm even when he\u2019s talking about the most harrowing thing you can imagine. That face gets a full workout in Hijack, in which Elba plays a corporate negotiator who finds himself trying to settle things with a group of, yes, hijackers who have taken over the flight he\u2019s boarded to get home to his family. This series is seven episodes, roughly seven hours\u2014the same length of the flight, and it follows the drama in the air and the political maneuvering below before attempting to stick the landing. Do stay around until the end.\n\nFor All Mankind\n\nLong before Foundation, there was For All Mankind. The show not only set the tone for the kind of glossy prestige sci-fi Apple TV+ had ambitions to make, but it was also the streaming service's attempt to plant its flag in the realm of streaming giants. A solid slice of alternate history, the show starts with a very smart premise: What if the US had been edged out in putting a man on the moon? How would the space-race rivalry between the Americans and the Soviets have played out? It's mostly a slick, stylish, NASA-heavy period drama, but as this is from the brain of Ronald D. Moore, there are a few standout moments and episodes with attention shared around the large ensemble cast. It might be the best sci-fi show you're not watching, and if that's true you now have multiple seasons to catch up on.\n\nMessi Meets America\n\nIf your home screen hasn't made it obvious, Apple TV+ is super stoked about soccer these days. Messi Meets America is a six-part docuseries about all-star player Lionel Messi's move to Major League Soccer's Inter Miami club. The first three episodes aired on October 11, 2023, and subsequent episodes aired in conjunction with last year's MLS season. Messi Mania, indeed.\n\nLessons in Chemistry\n\nBased on the debut novel from science writer Bonnie Garmus, Lessons in Chemistry is the story of Elizabeth Zott (Brie Larson), who gets hired to host a cooking show after she's fired from the lab she was working in for doing science while female. Obviously, the show Elizabeth puts on ends up being about a lot more than just having dinner on the table at 6 pm, but we suggest you watch to find out just how revolutionary it is.\n\nThe Morning Show\n\nEvery streaming service needs a flashy mainstream drama with Hollywood heavyweights to pull in viewers. Apple TV+ has The Morning Show. When Alex Levy (Jennifer Aniston) loses her morning news program cohost Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell) following sexual misconduct accusations, she gets paired up with Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon). What unfolds is a #MeToo-era drama full of TV network intrigue and Sorkin-lite dialog. In its second season, it went deep on Covid-19, and in the third season the series' fictional network, UBA, finds itself dealing with the aftermath of a cyberattack. There's likely a new season coming in 2025, so now's a good time to catch up, or go back and refresh your memory.\n\nShining Girls\n\nThis Elisabeth Moss psychological thriller/murder mystery came out in 2022 and never really got the buzz it likely deserved. All of that to say, you should probably watch it if you haven't already. Moss plays Kirby, a woman who believes a recent Chicago murder may be linked to an attack on her many years prior. She teams with a Sun-Times reporter to investigate, but the deeper she digs the more her own reality starts to shift. Based on the book The Shining Girls by Lauren Beukes, this series may seem like just another murder mystery, but its sci-fi twists put it one step ahead.\n\nFoundation\n\nWIRED called Foundation a \u201cflawed masterpiece\u201d in our review of the first season. Considering the complexities of adapting a sprawling Isaac Asimov book series, it was high praise. Starring Jared Harris as Hari Seldon, a math professor who, along with his loyal followers, is exiled for predicting the oncoming end of the galactic empire that rules over them, the show often suffers under the weight of its own massive scope. But it also features wonderful performances from Lee Pace and beautiful images inspired by the James Webb Space Telescope. If you have a soft spot for big sci-fi dramas, this Game-of-Thrones-in-space wannabe is a must-watch.\n\nThe Crowded Room\n\nSet in the late 1970s, The Crowded Room stars Tom Holland as Danny Sullivan, a young man arrested after a grisly shooting in New York City. Following his arrest, this 10-episode limited series unfolds into a twisty whodunit as interrogator Rya Goodwin (Amanda Seyfried) tries to suss out what happened with the shooting and the peculiar events in Sullivan\u2019s past that may have shaped how he ended up involved. Holland told Extra that the shoot for The Crowded Room, which he also produced, \u201cbroke\u201d him, leading to him taking a yearlong hiatus from acting. Want to see why? Watch now.\n\nSilo\n\nAs WIRED's Kate Knibbs noted in the wake of Silo's release, this show is prestige sci-fi gold. Based on a dystopian book trilogy by Hugh Howey, the series focuses on a subterranean bunker\u2014the silo of the title\u2014where humanity has sequestered itself after the apocalypse. Some are hoping to win the chance to reproduce, some are trying to solve mysterious murders. Everyone watching is enjoying figuring out what's going on in this underground city\u2014and what's happening outside of it.\n\nTed Lasso\n\nOn paper, Ted Lasso sounds terrible. The inconceivable story of an American football coach who has never watched a game of soccer somehow landing himself a job as coach of a (fictional) Premier League club and trying to make up for his total lack of qualifications by being a nice guy. Sounds unwatchable, doesn\u2019t it? And yet Ted Lasso has captured the hearts and minds of viewers on both sides of the pond with its large-as-life cast and irresistibly wholesome messaging, hoovering up awards in the process. The third and final season his the streamer last year, so now is the perfect time to binge it all.\n\nHigh Desert\n\nThe Patricia Arquette\u2013aissance doesn\u2019t get as much ink as Matthew McConaughey or Keanu Reeves did during their second comings, but it\u2019s here\u2014in part thanks to the rise of streaming. Between The Act and Severance, Arquette has received some of the highest accolades of her long career recently, and High Desert is no exception. While coming to terms with the death of her mother, Peggy (Arquette)\u2014an addict\u2014decides she wants to pick up the pieces of her life and become a private investigator. She finds an unwitting employer/sometime mentor in Bruce Harvey (Brad Garrett), but not everyone is onboard with Peggy\u2019s career decisions\u2014namely, her straitlaced sister (Christine Taylor). It\u2019s an odd duck of a show, which is perfectly suited to Arquette\u2019s ethereal acting style, allowing her to seamlessly flit between moments of tragedy and laugh-out-loud comedy, with the audiences doing their best to keep up. The all-star cast is made even more impressive by recurring appearances from Bernadette Peters as Peggy\u2019s late mom.\n\nBig Beasts\n\nLook, Discovery doesn't get to corner the market on animal documentaries\u2014and this 10-part docuseries proves it. Featuring elephant seals, brown bears, orangutans, giant otters, and all kinds of massive mammals in between, it's the perfect thing if you just want to escape and learn a few tidbits about nature. But the best part? It's narrated by Tom Hiddleston, and there's just something charming about hearing the voice of Loki talk about a bunch of different animals he could turn himself into in the blink of an eye.\n\nShrinking\n\nDo you enjoy In Treatment but wish it was, you know, fun? Then Shrinking may be right for you. Created by Bill Lawrence and Brett Goldstein\u2014of Ted Lasso fame\u2014and Jason Segel, the show is about Jimmy (Segel), a therapist struggling to get over the death of his wife and reconnect with his daughter and patients. That may sound like a downer, and the show isn\u2019t without its harder moments, but it\u2019s buoyed by the fact that it\u2019s also a workplace comedy focusing on the therapy practice where Jimmy works alongside Harrison Ford\u2019s Paul and Jessica Williams\u2019 Gaby.

{"title": "'Up Against It' Explores Life in the Asteroid Belt", "text": "Up Against It, a science fiction novel by environmental engineer Laura J. Mixon, explores life aboard the asteroid 25 Phocaea. The book takes a more realistic approach to space adventure, eschewing familiar tropes such as FTL drives and instantaneous communication.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m reading science fiction, one of the things I can really get into is stuff that\u2019s got a lot of scientific grounding,\u201d Mixon says in Episode 517 of the Geek\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy podcast. \u201cWhen I write, I try to really delve into that challenge of \u2018How can I make this believable but still really blow the reader\u2019s mind?'\u201d\n\nUp Against It paints a vivid picture of a space colony full of asteroid miners, gene hackers, and Martian mobsters. One interesting detail is \u201cthe Circuit,\u201d a rite of passage in which characters make a 13-year voyage around the asteroid belt. \u201cParticularly because people live longer [in the future], they feel like they can afford to do that,\u201d Mixon says. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like the people who climb Everest, only I think there\u2019s a little bit more of a sense that you\u2019re not really a \u2018stroider unless you can say that you\u2019ve done this.\u201d\n\nOne of the book\u2019s main characters is Jane Navio, commissioner of resource management on 25 Phocaea. For inspiration, Mixon drew on her own experience as a corporate officer at a scandal-plagued investment bank. \u201cI think Jane\u2019s regrets about her past, and having to deal with all the political machinations and how to get things achieved when people might have very different agendas than yours, that very much influenced Up Against It,\u201d she says.\n\nShe hopes the book will help encourage human settlements elsewhere in the solar system. \u201cI do think that storytellers are a really important part of bringing about the futures that we want to see,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to be able to imagine it before you can do it, so I wanted to write stories about that.\u201d\n\nListen to the complete interview with Laura J. Mixon in Episode 517 of Geek\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy (above). And check out some highlights from the discussion below.\n\nLaura J. Mixon on her first novel Astropilots:\n\nMelinda Snodgrass was friends with Ellen Datlow, who was the acquiring editor for this new YA series they were launching. They were looking for proposals, and all of a sudden I just had this flash of what I knew I wanted to write. I sat down and I wrote the first three chapters and an outline in just a very short period of time\u2014while I was still sick with the flu, during the Thanksgiving weekend\u2014and then sent it out. And then, in a week and a half or two weeks, Ellen contacted me and told me she wanted to buy it. I was flabbergasted. I never thought it would be that easy.\n\nLaura J. Mixon on her novel Proxies:\n\nI was learning how to write that as I went. It\u2019s a multi-viewpoint story. The first character you meet has amnesia, and it turns out that person is actually one of three personalities that occupy the same body. That person is a young man who has been trained to basically split his consciousness\u2014essentially he has [dissociative identity disorder]\u2014but it was induced so that he could control different proxy bodies at the same time. One of them is a woman, and she is one of the main characters of the book. That\u2019s a challenging thing to write\u2014and probably to read\u2014but I do have a lot of fondness for that book.\n\nLaura J.

{"title": "'Up Against It' Explores Life in the Asteroid Belt", "text": "Up Against It, a science fiction novel by environmental engineer Laura J. Mixon, explores life aboard the asteroid 25 Phocaea. The book takes a more realistic approach to space adventure, eschewing familiar tropes such as FTL drives and instantaneous communication.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m reading science fiction, one of the things I can really get into is stuff that\u2019s got a lot of scientific grounding,\u201d Mixon says in Episode 517 of the Geek\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy podcast. \u201cWhen I write, I try to really delve into that challenge of \u2018How can I make this believable but still really blow the reader\u2019s mind?'\u201d\n\nUp Against It paints a vivid picture of a space colony full of asteroid miners, gene hackers, and Martian mobsters. One interesting detail is \u201cthe Circuit,\u201d a rite of passage in which characters make a 13-year voyage around the asteroid belt. \u201cParticularly because people live longer [in the future], they feel like they can afford to do that,\u201d Mixon says. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like the people who climb Everest, only I think there\u2019s a little bit more of a sense that you\u2019re not really a \u2018stroider unless you can say that you\u2019ve done this.\u201d\n\nOne of the book\u2019s main characters is Jane Navio, commissioner of resource management on 25 Phocaea. For inspiration, Mixon drew on her own experience as a corporate officer at a scandal-plagued investment bank. \u201cI think Jane\u2019s regrets about her past, and having to deal with all the political machinations and how to get things achieved when people might have very different agendas than yours, that very much influenced Up Against It,\u201d she says.\n\nShe hopes the book will help encourage human settlements elsewhere in the solar system. \u201cI do think that storytellers are a really important part of bringing about the futures that we want to see,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to be able to imagine it before you can do it, so I wanted to write stories about that.\u201d\n\nListen to the complete interview with Laura J. Mixon in Episode 517 of Geek\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy (above). And check out some highlights from the discussion below.\n\nLaura J. Mixon on her first novel Astropilots:\n\nMelinda Snodgrass was friends with Ellen Datlow, who was the acquiring editor for this new YA series they were launching. They were looking for proposals, and all of a sudden I just had this flash of what I knew I wanted to write. I sat down and I wrote the first three chapters and an outline in just a very short period of time\u2014while I was still sick with the flu, during the Thanksgiving weekend\u2014and then sent it out. And then, in a week and a half or two weeks, Ellen contacted me and told me she wanted to buy it. I was flabbergasted. I never thought it would be that easy.\n\nLaura J. Mixon on her novel Proxies:\n\nI was learning how to write that as I went. It\u2019s a multi-viewpoint story. The first character you meet has amnesia, and it turns out that person is actually one of three personalities that occupy the same body. That person is a young man who has been trained to basically split his consciousness\u2014essentially he has [dissociative identity disorder]\u2014but it was induced so that he could control different proxy bodies at the same time. One of them is a woman, and she is one of the main characters of the book. That\u2019s a challenging thing to write\u2014and probably to read\u2014but I do have a lot of fondness for that book.\n\nLaura J. Mixon on asteroids:\n\nThe first scene I wrote [in Up Against It] was actually from Jane\u2019s perspective, when she\u2019s swinging out on the vines. They have these tethers, which is one way that they can travel among different asteroids. There are three that are strung along in the same orbit, and they use ion correctional jets to keep them aligned, but the rest of it, there\u2019s what I call \u201ctreeways,\u201d which are these rigid cables that span out from the cables among those three asteroids\u2014because asteroids are really far apart. Whenever you see in the movies where they have all these asteroids clustered together, that\u2019s not the way it really looks.\n\nLaura J.

The 12-episode series follows the crew from interstellar cargo vessel Demeter 227, stranded on the uncharted world of Vesta with seemingly no escape. (The bizarre creatures that call the planet home may be the least of the survivors\u2019 concerns.) Originally commissioned, then unjustly canceled, by Max, this spectacular animated show deserves your attention (especially since Netflix may extend its run if enough people watch).\n\nSweet Tooth\n\nBased on the comic book by Jeff Lemire, Sweet Tooth is set 10 years after \u201cThe Sick,\u201d a viral pandemic that killed most of the population and led\u2014somehow\u2014to babies being born with part-human, part-animal characteristics. The series follows Gus (Christian Convery), a half-deer hybrid boy who leaves the wilderness in search of his mother, and \u201cBig Man\u201d Tommy Jeppard (Nonso Anozie), a grizzled traveler who becomes his reluctant guide, protecting him from surviving humans who hate and fear the hybrids. The newly dropped third and final season ramps up the conflict between the two increasingly diverged species, while Gus and Jeppard face a final confrontation with Aditya Singh (Adeel Akhtar), a scientist researching the origins of The Sick, whose obsession with Gus has now taken on a religious fervor. Part sci-fi, part fantasy, part mystery, Sweet Tooth offers viewers a post-apocalyptic dystopia unlike any other.\n\nEric\n\nCreated and written by Abi Morgan (screenwriter of The Iron Lady and Suffragette), this psychological thriller follows TV puppeteer Vincent Anderson (Benedict Cumberbatch) and his wife Cassie (Gaby Hoffmann), left traumatized when their son Edgar (Ivan Morris Howe) goes missing. But while Detective Ledroit (McKinley Belcher III) investigates, brushing up against the darkest edges of Eric's 1980s New York setting, Vincent pursues other avenues\u2014like bringing the giant puppet Eric, designed by Edgar, to life onscreen in order to lure his son home. The distraught actions of a desperate father? Maybe\u2014but when Eric starts talking to Vincent, everything takes a far more surreal turn. While there are shades of the similarly imaginary-friend-tinged Happy! to Eric, this limited series leans more into themes of grief, loss, and the breakdown of relationships, material its cast almost uniformly mines to deliver star turns throughout.\n\nBridgerton\n\nStill ranking as one of Netflix\u2019s most-watched series ever, Bridgerton is set during the Regency period in England and follows the powerful Bridgerton family as they navigate love, marriage, and scandal\u2014with most of the latter stirred up by the gossip columns penned by the anonymous Lady Whistledown. Created for screen by Chris Van Dusen and executive produced by Shonda Rhimes, this incredibly bingeable and shockingly entertaining show is based on a series of novels by Julia Quinn, with each season focusing on a different branch of the Bridgerton tree. The third and latest season sees the spotlight fall on the long-simmering relationship between wallflower Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan) and Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton), a pairing that threatens to reveal powerful secrets that have been bubbling away since the very first episode.\n\nDead Boy Detectives\n\nEdwin Payne died in 1916. Charles Rowland passed in 1989. United in death, together they solve mysteries\u2014ghost mysteries! On the surface, The Sandman spinoff Dead Boy Detectives seems ludicrous, but its breezy pace and bounty of weird ideas (including a Cat King, a walrus cursed to live as a human, and a demon named David) keep things interesting. A solid central cast\u2014George Rexstrew as uptight Edwin, Jayden Revri as bruiser Charles, and Kassius Nelson as their psychic (and living) ally Crystal Palace\u2014bristle with chemistry, while the longer mysteries of how the deceased protagonists passed and why they choose to linger on Earth offer a touch more depth and emotional heft. It's got more of a YA flair than the parent series\u2014think Buffy meets Smallville, rather than the philosophically tinged Sandman\u2014but a few well-placed cameos, including Death (Kirby, formerly credited as Kirby Howell-Baptiste) and Despair (Donna Preston), help connect the two. A palate-cleansing crowd pleaser to fill the gap before The Sandman itself returns.\n\nChicken Nugget\n\nSome shows really make you stop and think about big, meaningful, existential questions. For example: \"What is it like to live as a chicken nugget?\" Adapted from a Korean webtoon by Park Ji-dok\u2014whose other work includes a comic called Killer Farts, as a starting reference point\u2014Chicken Nugget follows Choi Sun-man (Ryu Seung-ryong), president of technology company More Than Machines, and his eccentric intern Baek-joong (Ahn Jae-hong) as they seek a way to return Sun-man's daughter Min-ah (Kim You-jung) to human form after she's accidentally transformed into a \u2026 well, it's in the title. Look, there's no getting around how utterly weird this one is, but somehow, this incredibly surreal show somersaults over its bizarre premise to become an unexpectedly warm and endearing tale of human connection. Netflix's strangest series in years, but also oddly compelling.\n\nBlood of Zeus\n\nYou'd be forgiven for thinking this adult animated take on Greek mythology was another victim of Netflix's tendency to cancel shows with impunity\u2014the first season dropped in 2020, then, despite a relatively early renewal order, nothing, (Clearly nothing else happened that year to explain the delay \u2026) Now, four years later, the odyssey of demigod Heron, son of Zeus and mortal woman Electra, makes a welcome return. Picking up with Olympus in disarray following a godly coup and the fate of the cosmos at stake, Heron is sent on a decidedly more personal quest to rescue\u2014and possibly redeem\u2014his estranged brother. Blood of Zeus continues to impress with smart twists on classic stories (its take on the relationship between Persephone and Hades being a particular highlight) and fantastic animation. Let's just hope it's not another four years until the next season.\n\nBodkin\n\nWhen American podcaster Gilbert Power (Will Forte) and his enthusiastic assistant Emmy Sizergh (Robyn Cara) descend on the sleepy Irish town of Bodkin\u2014reluctantly aided by investigative journalist Dove Maloney (a brilliantly acerbic Siobh\u00e1n Cullen, cussing out everyone who glances her way)\u2014he thinks he's going to crack a decades-old missing-persons cold case. What he finds is a community with absolutely zero interest in his investigation, and even less in his attempts to \u201cconnect\u201d with his Irish roots. But before long, the villagers' quirky behavior starts to feel stereotypical, performative even\u2014and Power realizes the cold case may not be quite so chilly. Bodkin suffers from a slow start\u2014give it at least two episodes before writing it off as not for you\u2014but once this darkly comedic mystery gets going, you'll likely be just as invested as in your favorite true crime podcast. (Just don't take inspiration and try sleuthing any cold cases yourself.)\n\n3 Body Problem\n\nIn 1960s China, at the height of the Cultural Revolution, gifted scholar Wenjie Ye witnesses her physicist father being beaten to death for his research, only for her to be recruited to a secret project relying on that same knowledge. Fast-forward to the present day, and physics is broken: Particle accelerators around the world are delivering impossible data, while scientists are being plagued by countdowns only they can see. Meanwhile, strange VR headsets appear to be transporting players to an entirely different world\u2014and humanity\u2019s continued existence may rely on there being no \u201cgame over.\u201d Game of Thrones\u2019 creators D. B. Weiss and David Benioff and True Blood executive producer Alexander Woo reimagine Chinese author Cixin Liu\u2019s acclaimed hard sci-fi trilogy of first contact and looming interplanetary conflict as a more global affair. Wildly ambitious, and boasting an international cast featuring the likes of Benedict Wong, Rosalind Chao, Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez, and GOT alum John Bradley, Netflix's 3 Body Problem serves up the opening salvo in a richly detailed and staggeringly complex saga.\n\nParasyte: The Grey\n\nAlien spores rain down on Earth, releasing aggressive larvae driven to burrow into other creatures' heads, devour the brain, and take control of the body. Once in possession, these parasites are indistinguishable from regular people\u2014apart from the ability to warp the flesh and bone of their hosts' head into terrible weapons, which they use to hunt and consume humans from the shadows. Su-in Jeong (So-nee Jeon) almost became one of them, but when the parasite trying to take control of her exhausts itself saving her from a violent attacker, she\u2019s left sharing her body with an increasingly self-aware monster. Helmed by Train to Busan director Sang-ho Yeon, this Korean drama expands the world established in Hitoshi Iwaaki's sci-horror manga Parasyte, building on its social and environmental themes even as it delivers a terrific, and often terrifying, slice of body horror.\n\nRipley\n\nPerhaps best known nowadays from 1999\u2019s The Talented Mr. Ripley starring Matt Damon, novelist Patricia Highsmith\u2019s inveterate criminal Tom Ripley has a longer, darker legacy in print and on the screen. For this limited series, creator Steven Zaillian goes back to Highsmith's original text, presenting Ridley (a never-more-sinister Andrew Scott of All of Us Strangers) as a down-on-his-luck con man in 1950s New York who is recruited by a wealthy shipbuilder to travel to Italy and persuade the businessman\u2019s spoiled son Dickie Greenleaf (Johnny Flynn) to return home. But once in Italy, Ripley finds himself enamored with Dickie's lavish lifestyle\u2014and will do anything to take it for himself. Shot in black and white to really sell its noir credentials, this is an instant contender for the finest interpretation of Highsmith's works to date.\n\nGirls5eva\n\nSaving it from Peacock after two seasons, Netflix has gotten the band back together for this sharp comedy from creator Meredith Scardino. Twenty years after they split up, girl group Girls5Eva\u2014Dawn (Sara Bareilles), Gloria (Paula Pell), Summer (Busy Philipps), and Wickie (Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry)\u2014find themselves back in demand after their one big hit is sampled by popular rapper Li'l Stinker (Jeremiah Craft). Turning their renewed popularity into an opportunity to reunite, the women try to gain the stardom, respect, and musical integrity they never had in their youth, even as life has taken them in very different directions. Poking fun at the absurdity of the late \u201990s/early \u201900s pop scene\u2014and how little has changed since\u2014and heightened by an almost surrealist edge in places, Girls5eva is a comedy that deserves its time in the spotlight.\n\nAvatar: The Last Airbender\n\nA talented young cast bring to life the tale of Aang (Gordon Cormier), the latest in a long line of avatars who can control all four cardinal elements, but is frozen in time for a century when his world needed him most. Awakened by new friends Katara (Kiawentiio) and Sokka (Ian Ousley), he sets about continuing his training as the Avatar in an attempt to restore balance, all the while pursued by the relentless Prince Zuko (Dallas Liu), heir to the imperialist Fire Nation that has conquered the word. Consider this a cautious recommendation\u2014the original animated version, also on Netflix, remains superior\u2014but Netflix's live action Avatar remake serves up scale and spectacle, without betraying the heart of the classic show. It's also already confirmed for two more seasons, so viewers can look forward to the complete saga without the now-familiar Netflix cancellation worries.\n\nThe Legend of Korra\n\nIf you're still not sold on the live-action Avatar, this sequel to the original series is well worth your time. Set 70 years after the animated Avatar: The Last Airbender, The Legend of Korra explores how Aang's world has progressed after decades of relative peace. When Korra, the new Avatar, moves to Republic City to complete her training under the tutelage of Tenzin\u2014Aang's son, now with a family of his own\u2014she finds herself and new friends Mako and Bolin caught in the growing tensions between element benders and the Equalist movement, who claim the unpowered are an oppressed class. As the series progresses over its four seasons, The Legend of Korra proves itself a very different beast than its predecessor, exploring political themes and social prejudices in deeper\u2014and often darker\u2014detail, while also expanding the more fantastic elements of the universe and revealing the origins of the first Avatar. Even more brilliantly animated, and with a unique 1920s inspired aesthetic, Korra is a show that grew up alongside its audience, and is all the stronger for it.\n\nThe Gentlemen\n\nCreated by Guy Ritchie, and loosely following his 2019 film of the same name, this darkly comedic series follows Eddie Horniman (Theo James), a former British Army officer, after he inherits the family estate and title of Duke following his father's death. Oh, and the massive cannabis farm hidden beneath the grounds. Drawn into a literal criminal underground, Eddie finds himself having to deal with his family's legacy, his only real support coming from Susie (Kaya Scodelario), who's been running the drug empire. With a cast bolstered by Ray Winstone as Bobby Glass, Susie's incarcerated father and criminal kingpin, and Giancarlo Esposito as Stanley Johnston, an American investor with his own designs on the Horniman estate, The Gentlemen is a violent and blood-splattered crime caper in the heart of the British aristocracy. Consider it the antithesis of The Crown\u2014or not far removed from it, depending on your stance on the British Monarchy.\n\nGriselda\n\nCharting the life of infamous drug lord Griselda Blanco, who rose from a desperate life in Colombia to become a major player in the Miami drug wars, this dramatization shines largely thanks to a phenomenal performance from Sof\u00eda Vergara in the title role, channeling a chilling persona that makes her turn on Modern Family seem a lifetime away. While not entirely historically accurate, this limited series (co-created by Narcos' Doug Miro) weaves a mesmerizing tale of Blanco's efficiency in dominating the cocaine trade\u2014and her brutality in enforcing that control. A tight six episodes makes for a compelling, if shockingly violent, binge watch.\n\nStar Trek: Prodigy\n\nParamount+'s loss is Netflix's gain with the license rescue of this great Star Trek spinoff. Kicking off on a distant prison planet, a group of young escapees are forced to become a crew when they commandeer a lost\u2014and highly experimental\u2014Starfleet vessel. Guided by a hologram version of Star Trek: Voyager's iconic Captain Janeway (voiced by the venerable Kate Mulgrew), the untested cadets face a crash course in Federation ethics as they try to escape their former captor. While aimed at younger audiences and intended as an intro to the wider Trek universe, Prodigy packs in plenty for older Trekkies to appreciate\u2014and with the complete first season available now and another 20-episode season expected later in 2024, there's a lot to enjoy.\n\nQueer Eye\n\nThe Fab Five are back for another round of life-changing makeovers in New Orleans. With heroes including a deaf football coach who needs to step up to support his students, a Kiss superfan committed to caring for his brother, and a former nun looking for love, there's plenty to tug at the heart strings. With this season marking the last for design guru Bobby Berk, Queer Eye will doubtlessly be evolving when it returns for its already-confirmed ninth season, but for now, grab the tissues and prepare to ugly-happy-cry again.\n\nOne Day\n\nBased on David Nicholls' 2009 novel of the same name, this limited series charts the lives of Emma (Ambika Mod) and Dexter (Leo Woodall) over the course of 20 years. Starting with their graduation from Edinburgh University in 1988, each episode jumps forward one year at a time, revisiting them for a single day and exploring how their existences swirl around each other, even as fate seems to drag them apart. It's all gorgeously shot and produced, each half-hour episode a time capsule of its period, while the sizzling chemistry between the leads keeps you rooting for them even when you begin to suspect they're not meant for each other. An unexpectedly beautiful romcom.\n\nBeef\n\nEver been cut off in traffic? Ever had it happen when you\u2019re having a really bad day? Ever just wanted to take the low road, chase the person down and make them pay?! Then\u2014after a few deep breaths\u2014Beef is the show for you. It's a pressure valve for every petty grievance you\u2019ve ever suffered, following rich Amy (Ali Wong) and struggling Danny (Steven Yeun) as they escalate a road rage encounter into a vengeance-fueled quest to destroy the other. Yet Beef is more than a city-wide revenge thriller\u2014it's a biting look at how crushing modern life can be, particularly in its LA setting, where extravagant wealth brushes up against inescapable poverty and seemingly no one is truly happy. Part dramedy, part therapy, Beef is a bad example of conflict resolution but a cathartic binge watch that clearly resonates\u2014as evidenced by its growing clutch of awards, including the Golden Globe for Best Limited Series.\n\nLoudermilk\n\nSomething of a sleeper hit for years\u2014its first two seasons debuted on AT&T's now-defunct pay TV channel Audience in 2017, before its third season appeared over on Amazon\u2014all three seasons of this bleak comedy are now available on Netflix. Ron Livingston stars as Sam Loudermilk, a vitriolic former music critic and recovering alcoholic who proves almost pathologically incapable of holding his tongue when faced with life's small frustrations\u2014a personality type possibly ill-suited to leading others through addiction support groups. It's dark in places, and its central character is deliberately unlikeable, but smart writing and smarter performances shape this into something of an acerbic anti-Frasier.\n\nScott Pilgrim Takes Off\n\nAdapted from the beloved graphic novel series by Bryan Lee O'Malley, animated by one of the most exciting and dynamic studios in Japan, and voiced by the entire returning cast of director Edgar Wright's 2010 live-action adaption, Scott Pilgrim Takes Off would have been cult gold even if it was a straight retelling of its eponymous slacker's battles against lover Ramona Flowers' seven evil exes. Yet somehow, in a world devoid of surprises, this packs in killer twists from the very first episode, making for a show that's as fresh and exciting as ever. Saying anything else would ruin it\u2014just watch.\n\nSweet Home\n\nBased on the Korean webcomic by Kim Carnby and Hwang Young-chan, Sweet Home offers a very different vision of apocalyptic end times\u2014rather than pandemics, disasters, or even zombies, this posits an end of the world brought about by people's transformation into grotesque monsters, each unique and seemingly based on their deepest desires when they were human. The first season was a masterclass in claustrophobic horror, as the residents of an isolated, run-down apartment building\u2014chiefly suicidal teen Cha Hyun-soo (Song Kang), former firefighter Seo Yi-kyung (Lee Si-young), and Pyeon Sang-wook (Lee Jin-wook), who may be a brutal gangster\u2014battled for survival, while the long-awaited second season explores what remains of the wider world, delving into the true nature of both monster and man. With phenomenal effects work blending prosthetics, CGI, and even stop-motion animation for some disturbingly juddering creatures, this stands apart from the horror crowd.\n\nCastlevania: Nocturne\n\nFrance, 1792: as the French Revolution rages, citizens rise up against a parasitic ruling class\u2014but vampire hunter Richter Belmont and his magic-wielding ally Maria Renard are more concerned with what's literally bleeding the people dry. Yet conventional bloodsuckers turn out to be the least of their worries when the pair meets Annette and Edouard, who have travelled halfway around the world to warn of a coming \"Vampire Messiah\" prophesized to devour the sun\u2014let's just say the stakes have never been higher (sorry). Set centuries after the previous Castlevania animated series, this proves a perfect jumping on point while maintaining the high quality animation, tight plotting, and brilliant action that made the original such a hit.\n\nBodies\n\nFour detectives. Four time periods. Four murders? Maybe\u2014but only one body. This time-twisting thriller\u2014adapted from the comic of the same name by writer Si Spencer and artists Tula Lotay, Meghan Hetrick, Dean Ormston, and Phil Winslade\u2014hops from Victorian London to a dystopian future and back again, as the same corpse is found in the same spot in each era. The only thing stranger than the impossible crime itself is the conspiracy behind it, one that spans decades, impacting and linking every figure investigating the body. A brilliantly high-concept sci-fi crime drama, Bodies is one of the best one-and-done limited series to hit Netflix in years.\n\nPluto\n\nThink you know Astro Boy? Think again. In 2003, Naoki Urasawa (Monster, 20th Century Boys) updated original creator Osamu Tezuka's hugely influential \"The Greatest Robot on Earth\" story arc for his manga Pluto, opting for a more adult approach. The focus shifts from the heroic boy robot to grizzled cybernetic detective Gesicht as he investigates a series of murders of both humans and robots, each victim left with makeshift horns crammed into their heads. Meanwhile, Atom (Astro's Japanese name) is recast as a former peace ambassador, effectively a propaganda tool rolled out at the end of the 39th Central Asian War, still dealing with trauma from the experience. This adaptation is not only a faithful recreation of Urasawa's retelling, but is stunningly animated to a standard rarely seen in Netflix's original anime productions. With eight episodes, each around an hour long, this is as prestigious as any live-action thriller the streamer has produced, and a testament to both Tezuka and Urasawa's respective geniuses.\n\nBlue Eye Samurai\n\nIn the 17th Century, Japan enforced its \"sakoku\" isolationist foreign policy, effectively closing itself off from the world. Foreigners were few and far between\u2014so when Mizu (voiced by Maya Erskine) is born with blue eyes, nine months after her mother was assaulted by one of the four white men in the country, it marks her as an outsider, regarded as less than human. Years later, after being trained by a blind sword master and now masquerading as a man, Mizu hunts down those four men, knowing that killing them all is the only way to guarantee her vengeance. Exquisitely animated\u2014which makes its unabashed violence all the more graphic\u2014and with a phenomenal voice cast bolstered by the likes of George Takei, Brenda Song, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, and Kenneth Branagh, Blue Eye Samurai is one of the best adults-only animated series on Netflix.\n\nSex Education\n\nTalking about sex with your parents is always awkward, but for teenager Otis (Asa Butterfield) it's even worse: His mother Jean (a captivating Gillian Anderson) is a renowned sex therapist who won't stop talking about sex, leaving Otis himself ambivalent toward it. Still, something must have sunk in, and after helping a fellow student navigate a sexual conundrum, Otis finds himself almost accidentally running his own sex therapy clinic on campus. While the situations are often played for laughs, over its four seasons Sex Education thoughtfully explores intimacy, sexuality, and relationships in tender and even profound ways. With a fantastic ensemble cast including incoming Doctor Who star Ncuti Gatwa as Otis' best friend Eric and Emma Mackey as love interest Maeve, this UK-set and Welsh-filmed coming-of-age dramedy has proven itself one of Netflix's best series.\n\nLa R\u00e9volution\n\nIn a triumph of on-the-nose conceptualizing, La R\u00e9volution spins an alt-history romp in on-the-cusp-of-revolt France, where the cruel aristocracy become literal \u201cblue-bloods,\u201d thanks to a contagion that turns them into inky-veined, dandyish fiends ravenous for human flesh. A plucky reformist contessa who sympathizes with the commoners\u2019 plight\u2014first being exploited by the ruling class, and then being eaten by them\u2014allies with forces both rebel and supernatural as she tries to prevent the undead disease spreading from the elite of Versaille to the whole of France\u2019s upper crust. The melding of surprisingly great production values and a cast that\u2019s clearly enjoying themselves elevates this above your standard zombie nonsense\u2014and it\u2019s subtitled, which definitely means it\u2019s art house, right?\n\nPending Train\n\nNetflix: License one of Japan\u2019s best SF dramas in years. Also Netflix: Do nothing, literally nothing, to promote it, not even create an English subbed trailer. Which is where WIRED comes in\u2014Pending Train is a show you (and Netflix) shouldn\u2019t sleep on. When a train carriage is mysteriously transported into a post-apocalyptic future, the disparate passengers\u2019 first concern is simply survival. Between exploring their new surroundings and clashing with people from another stranded train car over scarce resources, one group\u2014including hairdresser Naoya, firefighter Yuto, and teacher Sae\u2014begins to realize that there may be a reason they\u2019ve been catapulted through time: a chance to go back and avert the disaster that ruined the world. A tense, 10-episode journey, Pending Train offers a Japanese twist on Lost, but one with tighter pacing and showrunners who actually have a clue where they want the story to go.\n\nOne Piece\n\nMark one up for persistence: After numerous anime adaptations ranging from \u201cawful\u201d to \u201cnot too bad,\u201d Netflix finally strikes gold with its live-action take on the global phenomenon One Piece. Despite fans\u2019 fears, this spectacularly captures the charm, optimism, and glorious weirdness of Eiichiro Oda\u2019s beloved manga, manifesting a fantasy world where people brandish outlandish powers and hunt for a legendary treasure in an Age of Piracy almost verbatim from the page. The perfectly cast I\u00f1aki Godoy stars as Monkey D. Luffy, would-be King of the Pirates, bringing an almost elastic innate physicality to the role that brilliantly matches the characters rubber-based stretching powers, while the crew Luffy gathers over this first season\u2014including swordsmaster Roronoa Zoro (Mackenyu), navigator and skilled thief Nami (Emily Rudd), sharpshooter Usopp (Jacob Romero Gibson), and martial artist chef Sanji (Taz Skylar)\u2014all brilliantly embody their characters. A lot could have gone wrong bringing One Piece to life, but this is a voyage well worth taking.\n\nRagnarok\n\nIf you're a fan of Norse mythology but Marvel's Thor got too goofy for you with Love and Thunder, this Norwegian fantasy drama may be more to your liking. Set in the present day, young Magne Seier (David Stakston) finds he is the reincarnation of the god of thunder just in time to take a stand against the sinister Jutul family, whose polluting factories blight his hometown of Edda. No, the show is not subtle with its references, nor its environmental message, but it's a fun reimagining of myth, especially as more members of the Norse pantheon start cropping up. Best of all, with only three six-episode seasons and an actual ending\u2014no surprise cancellations here!\u2014it's a nicely digestible binge-watch.\n\nThe Chosen One\n\nBased on the comic American Jesus by writer Mark Millar (Kick-Ass, Kingsman) and artist Peter Gross (Lucifer), The Chosen One follows 12-year-old Jodie (Bobby Luhnow), raised in Mexico by his mother Sarah (Dianna Agron). While the young boy would rather hang out with his friends, his life\u2014and potentially the world\u2014changes forever when he starts exhibiting miraculous powers, attracting dangerous attention from sinister forces. While this could have been yet another formulaic entry in Netflix's expansive library of supernatural teen dramas (the Stranger Things vibe is particularly strong), the decision to shoot on film and in a 4:3 aspect ratio make this a visual delight, unlike almost anything else on the streamer at present. There's an English dub, but stick to the original Spanish with English subs for a better viewing experience. (Confusingly, there's another show with the exact same title on Netflix, a 2019 Brazilian series following a trio of relief doctors in a village dominated by a cult leader\u2014also worth a watch, but don't get them confused!)\n\nHeartstopper\n\nArguably the most joyful show on Netflix is back for another school year of teen drama and heartfelt romance. With Charlie (Joe Locke) and Nick (Kit Connor) now officially dating, this long-awaited second season starts off with Nick struggling to come out as bisexual\u2014but it\u2019s openly-gay Charlie\u2019s parents who seem to struggle the most with their relationship. Meanwhile, Elle (Yasmin Finney) and Tao\u2019s (William Gao) will-they-won\u2019t-they saga continues to sizzle, and a school trip to Paris turns into a crucible for everyone\u2019s emotions. Although it steps into slightly darker terrain this season, the brilliant adaptation of Alice Oseman\u2019s graphic novels continues to be an utter delight\u2014the show younger LGBTQ+ viewers need now, older ones needed years ago, and that everyone needs to watch whatever your sexuality.\n\nCobra Kai\n\nWhile this latter day sequel to The Karate Kid films of the 1980s started life on YouTube Red (remember that?), it\u2019s really come into its own since moving to Netflix. Picking up decades after Daniel LaRusso and Johnny Lawrence\u2019s iconic fight at the end of the first movie, the debut season of Cobra Kai finds the tables turned, with Daniel living the charmed life while Johnny is washed up. Yet after defending his young neighbor Miguel (Xolo Maridue\u00f1a) in a fight, Johnny finds new meaning by re-opening the eponymous karate dojo and guiding a new generation of students. As the series progresses, the stakes get higher\u2014and frankly, increasingly, gloriously, ludicrous\u2014as rival martial arts schools start cropping up all over California and alliances are forged and broken with alarming regularity. It\u2019s all presented a little bit tongue-in-cheek, and with Ralph Macchio and William Zabka reprising their 1980s roles, the show is an unabashed love letter to the classic action flicks, but thanks to some seriously impressive fights and stunt work, and with a younger cast you can\u2019t help but root for, it\u2019s a retro-styled delight. With a sixth and final season in the works, now is the perfect time to binge the first five.\n\nCunk on Earth\n\nBritish comedy alert: This might not be for you. If, however, you appreciate drier-than-a-desert humor and cringe-inducingly awkward interviews, this is a must-watch. A perfectly framed lampoon of globe-trotting documentaries, Cunk on Earth sees host Philomena Cunk (in reality, comedian Diane Morgan) exploring world history, from the development of agriculture through to the space race, offering deranged insights and skewering real-world experts with incredibly stupid questions along the way. Morgan\u2019s relentlessly deadpan delivery alone makes this five-episode series worth a watch, but it\u2019s those interviews that make this comedy gold.\n\nGlitch\n\nTo those in the northern hemisphere, this Australian supernatural drama might be one of the best kept secrets of the last decade. Centred on a small town in Victoria, an entire community is shaken when seven people rise from their graves, seemingly in perfect health but with no memory of who they are or how they died. As police sergeant James Hayes (Patrick Brammall) and local doctor Elishia McKellar (Genevieve O'Reilly) try to contain and examine \u201cThe Risen,\u201d Hayes\u2019 world is rocked when he learns his own late wife Kate is among them. Over the course of three seasons and 18 episodes, the reasons for the dead\u2019s return is teased out, starting with simply \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhy,\u201d but building up to something that questions the rules of reality. A fantastic ensemble cast and brilliant pacing make this a must-see.\n\nBlack Mirror\n\nAs creator Charlie Brooker recently told WIRED, \u201cBlack Mirror wasn't meant to be \u2018this is what\u2019s going on in technology this week.\u2019 It was always designed to be a more paranoid and weird and hopefully unique show.\u201d And that it is, but rather than displaying what\u2019s going on in technology as it\u2019s happening, the show has a way of beating its viewers to the paranoid punch, addressing dystopian anxieties before they even happen. (Black Mirror was talking about AI long before your mom ever heard of ChatGPT.) There are now six seasons of Brooker's show on Netflix, and if you haven\u2019t watched, now may be the time. How else will you know what you\u2019ll be worried about five years from now?\n\nShe-Ra and the Princesses of Power\n\nOn the planet Etheria, Adora loyally serves the Horde, rising through its ranks with her close friend Catra by her side, until the discovery of a strange sword transforms her into the legendary warrior She-Ra. Learning the truth about the oppressive forces she's served her whole life, Adora joins the Rebellion against the Horde\u2014but can she really turn her back on everything she's ever known? And will Catra ever forgive the betrayal? Developed by ND Stevenson\u2014whose own Nimona delighted viewers as an animated movie on Netflix\u2014the modern She-Ra reimagines the 1980s classic, eschewing the original's connection to He-Man and episodic structure in favor of its own unique mythology and long-form storytelling, packed with complex characters, high stakes, and some powerfully emotional moments. Perfect for fans of Avatar: The Last Airbender or The Legend of Korra, this dazzlingly animated five-season action-fantasy is as compelling for older fans as it is younger viewers\u2014and some of the best LGBTQ+ representation to be found in any medium doesn't hurt either.\n\nQueen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story\n\nA prequel spinoff to Bridgerton\u2014the Shondaland-produced Regency era historical romance that continues to break Netflix viewership records\u2014Queen Charlotte takes viewers back to 1761, exploring how a young Charlotte (India Amarteifio) meets and marries George III (Corey Mylchreest). In typical Bridgerton fashion though, there\u2019s far more going on than a period love story, with the spirited Charlotte initially trying to escape the arranged marriage before learning to navigate the corridors of power\u2014and manage George\u2019s deteriorating mental health. Interspersed with scenes in Bridgerton\u2019s \u201cpresent day\u201d 1817, where the now-formidable stateswoman Queen Charlotte (a returning Golda Rosheuvel) deals with a succession crisis to the throne, this limited series is compulsory viewing for fans of the series, and a great entry point for anyone yet to be wooed by its charms.\n\nInside Man\n\nJefferson Grieff (Stanley Tucci) is a former criminology professor on death row for killing his wife, telling his story to a journalist named Beth (Lydia West). Harry Watling (David Tennant) is an unassuming English vicar, tending to his parishioners. The two men are a world apart\u2014until a horrific misunderstanding leads to Watling trapping a friend of Beth's in his basement. As Watling's situation and mental state deteriorate, Beth turns to the killer for help finding her friend. Created and written by Stephen Moffat, this tense transatlantic thriller has just a dash of The Silence of the Lambs, and with a cast at the top of their game, it\u2019s gripping viewing. Best of all, its tight four episodes mean you can binge it in one go.\n\nThe Diplomat\n\nIf there's a West Wing-shaped hole in your life, look no further than The Diplomat\u2014a tense geopolitical thriller elevated beyond the norms of the genre by a superb central performance by The Americans' Keri Russell as Kate Wyler, newly appointed US ambassador to the UK. Far from being an easy assignment in a friendly country, Kate's role coincides with an attack on a British aircraft carrier, leaving her to defuse an international crisis before it escalates into full-blown war. It's a job that might go easier if her own special relationship with husband Hal (Rufus Sewell) weren't fraying, as his resentment at being demoted leads him to interfere in her efforts. One of Netflix's biggest hits of 2023, The Diplomat has already been renewed for season two.\n\nAlice in Borderland\n\nWhen slacker Ryohei Arisu (Kento Yamazaki) is mysteriously transported to a deserted Tokyo, his keen gaming skills give him an edge navigating a series of lethal games that test intellect as much as physical prowess. Yet after barely scraping through several rounds, Arisu is no closer to uncovering the secrets of this strange borderland, or to finding a way home\u2014and the stakes are about to get even higher. Not only are Arisu and his allies Usagi (Tao Tsuchiya), Kuina (Aya Asahina), and Chishiya (Nijiro Murakami) faced with another gauntlet of sadistic games, but they find themselves caught between rival card suit \u201ccourts\u201d vying for power\u2014and not everyone can be trusted.\n\nWith its willingness to kill off main characters at a moment\u2019s notice, the first season of this gripping adaptation of Haro Aso\u2019s manga kept viewers on tenterhooks throughout. As the long-awaited second season leans further into its twisted Alice in Wonderland imagery, expect more shocking developments in this taut thriller.\n\nArcane\n\nLet's be honest: Animated series based on video games often run the gamut from cheap cash-ins to half-decent if forgettable tie-ins, inaccessible to anyone but hardcore devotees. In contrast, Arcane stands apart from the crowd by making its connections to Riot Games' League of Legends almost optional. While its central figures, orphaned sisters Vi and Jinx, are playable characters in the game, viewers don't need foreknowledge of their story to enjoy this steampunk saga of class war, civil uprising, and the people caught in between. With a gorgeous painterly art style, strong characters, and frequently shocking story beats, Arcane defies its origins to become one of the best animated series in years\u2014and it has racked up plenty of awards, including a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program, to prove it.\n\nThe Sandman\n\nThe Sandman is one of the most beloved comic series of the past 40 years. A dark fantasy about dreams, reality, stories, and the mercurial relationship between them, Neil Gaiman's books have endured as essential reading for goth teens and literati alike. While attempts to bring the saga of Dream of the Endless\u2014sometimes known as Morpheus, immortal embodiment and master of the nightlands, fierce and terrible in his wrath\u2014to the screen have been underway practically since the comic debuted in 1988, this long-in-development Netflix adaptation is worth the wait. It\u2019s a perfect translation of the first two graphic novels in the series and follows Dream (a sombre and imposing Tom Sturridge) as he restores his power and kingdom after being held in captivity for a century by occultists who snared him instead of his sister Death (Kirby Howell-Baptiste). Fittingly, the show has a dreamlike pacing to it, blurring the lines between episodic narratives and longer arcs, and it is as likely to leave viewers crying over a gargoyle\u2019s fate as it is to shock them with the sadistic actions of an escaped nightmare-turned-serial killer named the Corinthian (Boyd Holbrook). The Sandman\u2019s journey to the screen might have been the stuff of restless nights, but the result is a dream you won\u2019t want to wake up from.\n\nStranger Things\n\nNetflix's nostalgic sci-fi/horror series is back for its fourth season, set six months after the Battle of Starcourt and with its core cast separated for the first time. The Byers family and Eleven are off in California, Hopper is still (somehow) in a Russian prison, and the remaining crew are home in Hawkins, Indiana, about to face down a terrifying new threat\u2014high school. Oh, and another incursion from the horrific Upside Down. The Duffer Brothers continue to offer up plenty of 1980s nostalgia for viewers who grew up on a diet of Spielberg, Lucas, and Craven, while upping the stakes with a significant new threat. Expect drama, scares, and\u2014of course\u2014plenty of Dungeons & Dragons as the cult show roars toward its fifth and final season.\n\nRussian Doll\n\nIn Russian Doll, Nadia has one very big problem: Time keeps breaking around her. Season one finds Nadia\u2014played by Natasha Lyonne, who is also a cocreator on the show\u2014dying at her own birthday party, only to wake up there over and over again, trapped in a Groundhog Day-style loop until she can unravel her personalized knot in the space-time continuum. Things only get stranger in season two, where Nadia finds herself traveling back in time to 1982 and inhabiting the body of her own mother\u2014currently heavily pregnant with Nadia herself. Both seasons are funny and thought-provoking, reflecting on personal and generational trauma, all without overegging the potential for philosophical musing.\n\nSquid Game\n\nProduced in Korea, Squid Game blends Hunger Games and Parasite with a battle-royal-style contest. Hundreds of desperate, broke people are recruited to a contest where they can win enough money to never need to worry about their debts again. All they have to do to win the \u20a945.6 billion ($35.8 million) jackpot is complete six children\u2019s games. But it\u2019s not that simple: All the games have a twist, and very few people make it out alive. Squid Game is intense, brutal, and often very graphic, but it is also completely gripping. Netflix\u2019s dubbing isn\u2019t the best in this instance, but the nine episodes are compelling enough to make up for it.\n\nLupin\n\nArs\u00e8ne Lupin, the belle epoque burglar created by French novelist Maurice Leblanc in the early 1900s, is reinvented as Assane Diop, a first-generation Frenchman with a mania for Lupin books and a grudge against the powerful forces who decades ago framed his father for a theft he didn\u2019t commit\u2014and led him to die in prison. Pairing drones, social media bots, and hacking skills with traditional tools of the trade like fake beards, picklocks, and quick wits, Diop hunts down his adversaries as he searches for the truth about his father\u2019s fate. In his spare time, Diop also tries to patch together a crumbling marriage and build a better rapport with his son. Worth watching in the French original, this five-episode series\u2019 strength lies in the dialog, the character development, and the charismatic performance of Omar Sy as Assane. The actual escapades and daring heists are beautifully choreographed, but a lot of the mechanics\u2014how a certain piece of legerdemain worked, when an impenetrable building was infiltrated\u2014are left to the viewer's imagination.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast', 'Matt Kamen', 'Wired Staff', 'Jennifer M.

The 12-episode series follows the crew from interstellar cargo vessel Demeter 227, stranded on the uncharted world of Vesta with seemingly no escape. (The bizarre creatures that call the planet home may be the least of the survivors\u2019 concerns.) Originally commissioned, then unjustly canceled, by Max, this spectacular animated show deserves your attention (especially since Netflix may extend its run if enough people watch).\n\nSweet Tooth\n\nBased on the comic book by Jeff Lemire, Sweet Tooth is set 10 years after \u201cThe Sick,\u201d a viral pandemic that killed most of the population and led\u2014somehow\u2014to babies being born with part-human, part-animal characteristics. The series follows Gus (Christian Convery), a half-deer hybrid boy who leaves the wilderness in search of his mother, and \u201cBig Man\u201d Tommy Jeppard (Nonso Anozie), a grizzled traveler who becomes his reluctant guide, protecting him from surviving humans who hate and fear the hybrids. The newly dropped third and final season ramps up the conflict between the two increasingly diverged species, while Gus and Jeppard face a final confrontation with Aditya Singh (Adeel Akhtar), a scientist researching the origins of The Sick, whose obsession with Gus has now taken on a religious fervor. Part sci-fi, part fantasy, part mystery, Sweet Tooth offers viewers a post-apocalyptic dystopia unlike any other.\n\nEric\n\nCreated and written by Abi Morgan (screenwriter of The Iron Lady and Suffragette), this psychological thriller follows TV puppeteer Vincent Anderson (Benedict Cumberbatch) and his wife Cassie (Gaby Hoffmann), left traumatized when their son Edgar (Ivan Morris Howe) goes missing. But while Detective Ledroit (McKinley Belcher III) investigates, brushing up against the darkest edges of Eric's 1980s New York setting, Vincent pursues other avenues\u2014like bringing the giant puppet Eric, designed by Edgar, to life onscreen in order to lure his son home. The distraught actions of a desperate father? Maybe\u2014but when Eric starts talking to Vincent, everything takes a far more surreal turn. While there are shades of the similarly imaginary-friend-tinged Happy! to Eric, this limited series leans more into themes of grief, loss, and the breakdown of relationships, material its cast almost uniformly mines to deliver star turns throughout.\n\nBridgerton\n\nStill ranking as one of Netflix\u2019s most-watched series ever, Bridgerton is set during the Regency period in England and follows the powerful Bridgerton family as they navigate love, marriage, and scandal\u2014with most of the latter stirred up by the gossip columns penned by the anonymous Lady Whistledown. Created for screen by Chris Van Dusen and executive produced by Shonda Rhimes, this incredibly bingeable and shockingly entertaining show is based on a series of novels by Julia Quinn, with each season focusing on a different branch of the Bridgerton tree. The third and latest season sees the spotlight fall on the long-simmering relationship between wallflower Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan) and Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton), a pairing that threatens to reveal powerful secrets that have been bubbling away since the very first episode.\n\nDead Boy Detectives\n\nEdwin Payne died in 1916. Charles Rowland passed in 1989. United in death, together they solve mysteries\u2014ghost mysteries! On the surface, The Sandman spinoff Dead Boy Detectives seems ludicrous, but its breezy pace and bounty of weird ideas (including a Cat King, a walrus cursed to live as a human, and a demon named David) keep things interesting. A solid central cast\u2014George Rexstrew as uptight Edwin, Jayden Revri as bruiser Charles, and Kassius Nelson as their psychic (and living) ally Crystal Palace\u2014bristle with chemistry, while the longer mysteries of how the deceased protagonists passed and why they choose to linger on Earth offer a touch more depth and emotional heft. It's got more of a YA flair than the parent series\u2014think Buffy meets Smallville, rather than the philosophically tinged Sandman\u2014but a few well-placed cameos, including Death (Kirby, formerly credited as Kirby Howell-Baptiste) and Despair (Donna Preston), help connect the two. A palate-cleansing crowd pleaser to fill the gap before The Sandman itself returns.\n\nChicken Nugget\n\nSome shows really make you stop and think about big, meaningful, existential questions. For example: \"What is it like to live as a chicken nugget?\" Adapted from a Korean webtoon by Park Ji-dok\u2014whose other work includes a comic called Killer Farts, as a starting reference point\u2014Chicken Nugget follows Choi Sun-man (Ryu Seung-ryong), president of technology company More Than Machines, and his eccentric intern Baek-joong (Ahn Jae-hong) as they seek a way to return Sun-man's daughter Min-ah (Kim You-jung) to human form after she's accidentally transformed into a \u2026 well, it's in the title. Look, there's no getting around how utterly weird this one is, but somehow, this incredibly surreal show somersaults over its bizarre premise to become an unexpectedly warm and endearing tale of human connection. Netflix's strangest series in years, but also oddly compelling.\n\nBlood of Zeus\n\nYou'd be forgiven for thinking this adult animated take on Greek mythology was another victim of Netflix's tendency to cancel shows with impunity\u2014the first season dropped in 2020, then, despite a relatively early renewal order, nothing, (Clearly nothing else happened that year to explain the delay \u2026) Now, four years later, the odyssey of demigod Heron, son of Zeus and mortal woman Electra, makes a welcome return. Picking up with Olympus in disarray following a godly coup and the fate of the cosmos at stake, Heron is sent on a decidedly more personal quest to rescue\u2014and possibly redeem\u2014his estranged brother. Blood of Zeus continues to impress with smart twists on classic stories (its take on the relationship between Persephone and Hades being a particular highlight) and fantastic animation. Let's just hope it's not another four years until the next season.\n\nBodkin\n\nWhen American podcaster Gilbert Power (Will Forte) and his enthusiastic assistant Emmy Sizergh (Robyn Cara) descend on the sleepy Irish town of Bodkin\u2014reluctantly aided by investigative journalist Dove Maloney (a brilliantly acerbic Siobh\u00e1n Cullen, cussing out everyone who glances her way)\u2014he thinks he's going to crack a decades-old missing-persons cold case. What he finds is a community with absolutely zero interest in his investigation, and even less in his attempts to \u201cconnect\u201d with his Irish roots. But before long, the villagers' quirky behavior starts to feel stereotypical, performative even\u2014and Power realizes the cold case may not be quite so chilly. Bodkin suffers from a slow start\u2014give it at least two episodes before writing it off as not for you\u2014but once this darkly comedic mystery gets going, you'll likely be just as invested as in your favorite true crime podcast. (Just don't take inspiration and try sleuthing any cold cases yourself.)\n\n3 Body Problem\n\nIn 1960s China, at the height of the Cultural Revolution, gifted scholar Wenjie Ye witnesses her physicist father being beaten to death for his research, only for her to be recruited to a secret project relying on that same knowledge. Fast-forward to the present day, and physics is broken: Particle accelerators around the world are delivering impossible data, while scientists are being plagued by countdowns only they can see. Meanwhile, strange VR headsets appear to be transporting players to an entirely different world\u2014and humanity\u2019s continued existence may rely on there being no \u201cgame over.\u201d Game of Thrones\u2019 creators D. B. Weiss and David Benioff and True Blood executive producer Alexander Woo reimagine Chinese author Cixin Liu\u2019s acclaimed hard sci-fi trilogy of first contact and looming interplanetary conflict as a more global affair. Wildly ambitious, and boasting an international cast featuring the likes of Benedict Wong, Rosalind Chao, Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez, and GOT alum John Bradley, Netflix's 3 Body Problem serves up the opening salvo in a richly detailed and staggeringly complex saga.\n\nParasyte: The Grey\n\nAlien spores rain down on Earth, releasing aggressive larvae driven to burrow into other creatures' heads, devour the brain, and take control of the body. Once in possession, these parasites are indistinguishable from regular people\u2014apart from the ability to warp the flesh and bone of their hosts' head into terrible weapons, which they use to hunt and consume humans from the shadows. Su-in Jeong (So-nee Jeon) almost became one of them, but when the parasite trying to take control of her exhausts itself saving her from a violent attacker, she\u2019s left sharing her body with an increasingly self-aware monster. Helmed by Train to Busan director Sang-ho Yeon, this Korean drama expands the world established in Hitoshi Iwaaki's sci-horror manga Parasyte, building on its social and environmental themes even as it delivers a terrific, and often terrifying, slice of body horror.\n\nRipley\n\nPerhaps best known nowadays from 1999\u2019s The Talented Mr. Ripley starring Matt Damon, novelist Patricia Highsmith\u2019s inveterate criminal Tom Ripley has a longer, darker legacy in print and on the screen. For this limited series, creator Steven Zaillian goes back to Highsmith's original text, presenting Ridley (a never-more-sinister Andrew Scott of All of Us Strangers) as a down-on-his-luck con man in 1950s New York who is recruited by a wealthy shipbuilder to travel to Italy and persuade the businessman\u2019s spoiled son Dickie Greenleaf (Johnny Flynn) to return home. But once in Italy, Ripley finds himself enamored with Dickie's lavish lifestyle\u2014and will do anything to take it for himself. Shot in black and white to really sell its noir credentials, this is an instant contender for the finest interpretation of Highsmith's works to date.\n\nGirls5eva\n\nSaving it from Peacock after two seasons, Netflix has gotten the band back together for this sharp comedy from creator Meredith Scardino. Twenty years after they split up, girl group Girls5Eva\u2014Dawn (Sara Bareilles), Gloria (Paula Pell), Summer (Busy Philipps), and Wickie (Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry)\u2014find themselves back in demand after their one big hit is sampled by popular rapper Li'l Stinker (Jeremiah Craft). Turning their renewed popularity into an opportunity to reunite, the women try to gain the stardom, respect, and musical integrity they never had in their youth, even as life has taken them in very different directions. Poking fun at the absurdity of the late \u201990s/early \u201900s pop scene\u2014and how little has changed since\u2014and heightened by an almost surrealist edge in places, Girls5eva is a comedy that deserves its time in the spotlight.\n\nAvatar: The Last Airbender\n\nA talented young cast bring to life the tale of Aang (Gordon Cormier), the latest in a long line of avatars who can control all four cardinal elements, but is frozen in time for a century when his world needed him most. Awakened by new friends Katara (Kiawentiio) and Sokka (Ian Ousley), he sets about continuing his training as the Avatar in an attempt to restore balance, all the while pursued by the relentless Prince Zuko (Dallas Liu), heir to the imperialist Fire Nation that has conquered the word. Consider this a cautious recommendation\u2014the original animated version, also on Netflix, remains superior\u2014but Netflix's live action Avatar remake serves up scale and spectacle, without betraying the heart of the classic show. It's also already confirmed for two more seasons, so viewers can look forward to the complete saga without the now-familiar Netflix cancellation worries.\n\nThe Legend of Korra\n\nIf you're still not sold on the live-action Avatar, this sequel to the original series is well worth your time. Set 70 years after the animated Avatar: The Last Airbender, The Legend of Korra explores how Aang's world has progressed after decades of relative peace. When Korra, the new Avatar, moves to Republic City to complete her training under the tutelage of Tenzin\u2014Aang's son, now with a family of his own\u2014she finds herself and new friends Mako and Bolin caught in the growing tensions between element benders and the Equalist movement, who claim the unpowered are an oppressed class. As the series progresses over its four seasons, The Legend of Korra proves itself a very different beast than its predecessor, exploring political themes and social prejudices in deeper\u2014and often darker\u2014detail, while also expanding the more fantastic elements of the universe and revealing the origins of the first Avatar. Even more brilliantly animated, and with a unique 1920s inspired aesthetic, Korra is a show that grew up alongside its audience, and is all the stronger for it.\n\nThe Gentlemen\n\nCreated by Guy Ritchie, and loosely following his 2019 film of the same name, this darkly comedic series follows Eddie Horniman (Theo James), a former British Army officer, after he inherits the family estate and title of Duke following his father's death. Oh, and the massive cannabis farm hidden beneath the grounds. Drawn into a literal criminal underground, Eddie finds himself having to deal with his family's legacy, his only real support coming from Susie (Kaya Scodelario), who's been running the drug empire. With a cast bolstered by Ray Winstone as Bobby Glass, Susie's incarcerated father and criminal kingpin, and Giancarlo Esposito as Stanley Johnston, an American investor with his own designs on the Horniman estate, The Gentlemen is a violent and blood-splattered crime caper in the heart of the British aristocracy. Consider it the antithesis of The Crown\u2014or not far removed from it, depending on your stance on the British Monarchy.\n\nGriselda\n\nCharting the life of infamous drug lord Griselda Blanco, who rose from a desperate life in Colombia to become a major player in the Miami drug wars, this dramatization shines largely thanks to a phenomenal performance from Sof\u00eda Vergara in the title role, channeling a chilling persona that makes her turn on Modern Family seem a lifetime away. While not entirely historically accurate, this limited series (co-created by Narcos' Doug Miro) weaves a mesmerizing tale of Blanco's efficiency in dominating the cocaine trade\u2014and her brutality in enforcing that control. A tight six episodes makes for a compelling, if shockingly violent, binge watch.\n\nStar Trek: Prodigy\n\nParamount+'s loss is Netflix's gain with the license rescue of this great Star Trek spinoff. Kicking off on a distant prison planet, a group of young escapees are forced to become a crew when they commandeer a lost\u2014and highly experimental\u2014Starfleet vessel. Guided by a hologram version of Star Trek: Voyager's iconic Captain Janeway (voiced by the venerable Kate Mulgrew), the untested cadets face a crash course in Federation ethics as they try to escape their former captor. While aimed at younger audiences and intended as an intro to the wider Trek universe, Prodigy packs in plenty for older Trekkies to appreciate\u2014and with the complete first season available now and another 20-episode season expected later in 2024, there's a lot to enjoy.\n\nQueer Eye\n\nThe Fab Five are back for another round of life-changing makeovers in New Orleans. With heroes including a deaf football coach who needs to step up to support his students, a Kiss superfan committed to caring for his brother, and a former nun looking for love, there's plenty to tug at the heart strings. With this season marking the last for design guru Bobby Berk, Queer Eye will doubtlessly be evolving when it returns for its already-confirmed ninth season, but for now, grab the tissues and prepare to ugly-happy-cry again.\n\nOne Day\n\nBased on David Nicholls' 2009 novel of the same name, this limited series charts the lives of Emma (Ambika Mod) and Dexter (Leo Woodall) over the course of 20 years. Starting with their graduation from Edinburgh University in 1988, each episode jumps forward one year at a time, revisiting them for a single day and exploring how their existences swirl around each other, even as fate seems to drag them apart. It's all gorgeously shot and produced, each half-hour episode a time capsule of its period, while the sizzling chemistry between the leads keeps you rooting for them even when you begin to suspect they're not meant for each other. An unexpectedly beautiful romcom.\n\nBeef\n\nEver been cut off in traffic? Ever had it happen when you\u2019re having a really bad day? Ever just wanted to take the low road, chase the person down and make them pay?! Then\u2014after a few deep breaths\u2014Beef is the show for you. It's a pressure valve for every petty grievance you\u2019ve ever suffered, following rich Amy (Ali Wong) and struggling Danny (Steven Yeun) as they escalate a road rage encounter into a vengeance-fueled quest to destroy the other. Yet Beef is more than a city-wide revenge thriller\u2014it's a biting look at how crushing modern life can be, particularly in its LA setting, where extravagant wealth brushes up against inescapable poverty and seemingly no one is truly happy. Part dramedy, part therapy, Beef is a bad example of conflict resolution but a cathartic binge watch that clearly resonates\u2014as evidenced by its growing clutch of awards, including the Golden Globe for Best Limited Series.\n\nLoudermilk\n\nSomething of a sleeper hit for years\u2014its first two seasons debuted on AT&T's now-defunct pay TV channel Audience in 2017, before its third season appeared over on Amazon\u2014all three seasons of this bleak comedy are now available on Netflix. Ron Livingston stars as Sam Loudermilk, a vitriolic former music critic and recovering alcoholic who proves almost pathologically incapable of holding his tongue when faced with life's small frustrations\u2014a personality type possibly ill-suited to leading others through addiction support groups. It's dark in places, and its central character is deliberately unlikeable, but smart writing and smarter performances shape this into something of an acerbic anti-Frasier.\n\nScott Pilgrim Takes Off\n\nAdapted from the beloved graphic novel series by Bryan Lee O'Malley, animated by one of the most exciting and dynamic studios in Japan, and voiced by the entire returning cast of director Edgar Wright's 2010 live-action adaption, Scott Pilgrim Takes Off would have been cult gold even if it was a straight retelling of its eponymous slacker's battles against lover Ramona Flowers' seven evil exes. Yet somehow, in a world devoid of surprises, this packs in killer twists from the very first episode, making for a show that's as fresh and exciting as ever. Saying anything else would ruin it\u2014just watch.\n\nSweet Home\n\nBased on the Korean webcomic by Kim Carnby and Hwang Young-chan, Sweet Home offers a very different vision of apocalyptic end times\u2014rather than pandemics, disasters, or even zombies, this posits an end of the world brought about by people's transformation into grotesque monsters, each unique and seemingly based on their deepest desires when they were human. The first season was a masterclass in claustrophobic horror, as the residents of an isolated, run-down apartment building\u2014chiefly suicidal teen Cha Hyun-soo (Song Kang), former firefighter Seo Yi-kyung (Lee Si-young), and Pyeon Sang-wook (Lee Jin-wook), who may be a brutal gangster\u2014battled for survival, while the long-awaited second season explores what remains of the wider world, delving into the true nature of both monster and man. With phenomenal effects work blending prosthetics, CGI, and even stop-motion animation for some disturbingly juddering creatures, this stands apart from the horror crowd.\n\nCastlevania: Nocturne\n\nFrance, 1792: as the French Revolution rages, citizens rise up against a parasitic ruling class\u2014but vampire hunter Richter Belmont and his magic-wielding ally Maria Renard are more concerned with what's literally bleeding the people dry. Yet conventional bloodsuckers turn out to be the least of their worries when the pair meets Annette and Edouard, who have travelled halfway around the world to warn of a coming \"Vampire Messiah\" prophesized to devour the sun\u2014let's just say the stakes have never been higher (sorry). Set centuries after the previous Castlevania animated series, this proves a perfect jumping on point while maintaining the high quality animation, tight plotting, and brilliant action that made the original such a hit.\n\nBodies\n\nFour detectives. Four time periods. Four murders? Maybe\u2014but only one body. This time-twisting thriller\u2014adapted from the comic of the same name by writer Si Spencer and artists Tula Lotay, Meghan Hetrick, Dean Ormston, and Phil Winslade\u2014hops from Victorian London to a dystopian future and back again, as the same corpse is found in the same spot in each era. The only thing stranger than the impossible crime itself is the conspiracy behind it, one that spans decades, impacting and linking every figure investigating the body. A brilliantly high-concept sci-fi crime drama, Bodies is one of the best one-and-done limited series to hit Netflix in years.\n\nPluto\n\nThink you know Astro Boy? Think again. In 2003, Naoki Urasawa (Monster, 20th Century Boys) updated original creator Osamu Tezuka's hugely influential \"The Greatest Robot on Earth\" story arc for his manga Pluto, opting for a more adult approach. The focus shifts from the heroic boy robot to grizzled cybernetic detective Gesicht as he investigates a series of murders of both humans and robots, each victim left with makeshift horns crammed into their heads. Meanwhile, Atom (Astro's Japanese name) is recast as a former peace ambassador, effectively a propaganda tool rolled out at the end of the 39th Central Asian War, still dealing with trauma from the experience. This adaptation is not only a faithful recreation of Urasawa's retelling, but is stunningly animated to a standard rarely seen in Netflix's original anime productions. With eight episodes, each around an hour long, this is as prestigious as any live-action thriller the streamer has produced, and a testament to both Tezuka and Urasawa's respective geniuses.\n\nBlue Eye Samurai\n\nIn the 17th Century, Japan enforced its \"sakoku\" isolationist foreign policy, effectively closing itself off from the world. Foreigners were few and far between\u2014so when Mizu (voiced by Maya Erskine) is born with blue eyes, nine months after her mother was assaulted by one of the four white men in the country, it marks her as an outsider, regarded as less than human. Years later, after being trained by a blind sword master and now masquerading as a man, Mizu hunts down those four men, knowing that killing them all is the only way to guarantee her vengeance. Exquisitely animated\u2014which makes its unabashed violence all the more graphic\u2014and with a phenomenal voice cast bolstered by the likes of George Takei, Brenda Song, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, and Kenneth Branagh, Blue Eye Samurai is one of the best adults-only animated series on Netflix.\n\nSex Education\n\nTalking about sex with your parents is always awkward, but for teenager Otis (Asa Butterfield) it's even worse: His mother Jean (a captivating Gillian Anderson) is a renowned sex therapist who won't stop talking about sex, leaving Otis himself ambivalent toward it. Still, something must have sunk in, and after helping a fellow student navigate a sexual conundrum, Otis finds himself almost accidentally running his own sex therapy clinic on campus. While the situations are often played for laughs, over its four seasons Sex Education thoughtfully explores intimacy, sexuality, and relationships in tender and even profound ways. With a fantastic ensemble cast including incoming Doctor Who star Ncuti Gatwa as Otis' best friend Eric and Emma Mackey as love interest Maeve, this UK-set and Welsh-filmed coming-of-age dramedy has proven itself one of Netflix's best series.\n\nLa R\u00e9volution\n\nIn a triumph of on-the-nose conceptualizing, La R\u00e9volution spins an alt-history romp in on-the-cusp-of-revolt France, where the cruel aristocracy become literal \u201cblue-bloods,\u201d thanks to a contagion that turns them into inky-veined, dandyish fiends ravenous for human flesh. A plucky reformist contessa who sympathizes with the commoners\u2019 plight\u2014first being exploited by the ruling class, and then being eaten by them\u2014allies with forces both rebel and supernatural as she tries to prevent the undead disease spreading from the elite of Versaille to the whole of France\u2019s upper crust. The melding of surprisingly great production values and a cast that\u2019s clearly enjoying themselves elevates this above your standard zombie nonsense\u2014and it\u2019s subtitled, which definitely means it\u2019s art house, right?\n\nPending Train\n\nNetflix: License one of Japan\u2019s best SF dramas in years. Also Netflix: Do nothing, literally nothing, to promote it, not even create an English subbed trailer. Which is where WIRED comes in\u2014Pending Train is a show you (and Netflix) shouldn\u2019t sleep on. When a train carriage is mysteriously transported into a post-apocalyptic future, the disparate passengers\u2019 first concern is simply survival. Between exploring their new surroundings and clashing with people from another stranded train car over scarce resources, one group\u2014including hairdresser Naoya, firefighter Yuto, and teacher Sae\u2014begins to realize that there may be a reason they\u2019ve been catapulted through time: a chance to go back and avert the disaster that ruined the world. A tense, 10-episode journey, Pending Train offers a Japanese twist on Lost, but one with tighter pacing and showrunners who actually have a clue where they want the story to go.\n\nOne Piece\n\nMark one up for persistence: After numerous anime adaptations ranging from \u201cawful\u201d to \u201cnot too bad,\u201d Netflix finally strikes gold with its live-action take on the global phenomenon One Piece. Despite fans\u2019 fears, this spectacularly captures the charm, optimism, and glorious weirdness of Eiichiro Oda\u2019s beloved manga, manifesting a fantasy world where people brandish outlandish powers and hunt for a legendary treasure in an Age of Piracy almost verbatim from the page. The perfectly cast I\u00f1aki Godoy stars as Monkey D. Luffy, would-be King of the Pirates, bringing an almost elastic innate physicality to the role that brilliantly matches the characters rubber-based stretching powers, while the crew Luffy gathers over this first season\u2014including swordsmaster Roronoa Zoro (Mackenyu), navigator and skilled thief Nami (Emily Rudd), sharpshooter Usopp (Jacob Romero Gibson), and martial artist chef Sanji (Taz Skylar)\u2014all brilliantly embody their characters. A lot could have gone wrong bringing One Piece to life, but this is a voyage well worth taking.\n\nRagnarok\n\nIf you're a fan of Norse mythology but Marvel's Thor got too goofy for you with Love and Thunder, this Norwegian fantasy drama may be more to your liking. Set in the present day, young Magne Seier (David Stakston) finds he is the reincarnation of the god of thunder just in time to take a stand against the sinister Jutul family, whose polluting factories blight his hometown of Edda. No, the show is not subtle with its references, nor its environmental message, but it's a fun reimagining of myth, especially as more members of the Norse pantheon start cropping up. Best of all, with only three six-episode seasons and an actual ending\u2014no surprise cancellations here!\u2014it's a nicely digestible binge-watch.\n\nThe Chosen One\n\nBased on the comic American Jesus by writer Mark Millar (Kick-Ass, Kingsman) and artist Peter Gross (Lucifer), The Chosen One follows 12-year-old Jodie (Bobby Luhnow), raised in Mexico by his mother Sarah (Dianna Agron). While the young boy would rather hang out with his friends, his life\u2014and potentially the world\u2014changes forever when he starts exhibiting miraculous powers, attracting dangerous attention from sinister forces. While this could have been yet another formulaic entry in Netflix's expansive library of supernatural teen dramas (the Stranger Things vibe is particularly strong), the decision to shoot on film and in a 4:3 aspect ratio make this a visual delight, unlike almost anything else on the streamer at present. There's an English dub, but stick to the original Spanish with English subs for a better viewing experience. (Confusingly, there's another show with the exact same title on Netflix, a 2019 Brazilian series following a trio of relief doctors in a village dominated by a cult leader\u2014also worth a watch, but don't get them confused!)\n\nHeartstopper\n\nArguably the most joyful show on Netflix is back for another school year of teen drama and heartfelt romance. With Charlie (Joe Locke) and Nick (Kit Connor) now officially dating, this long-awaited second season starts off with Nick struggling to come out as bisexual\u2014but it\u2019s openly-gay Charlie\u2019s parents who seem to struggle the most with their relationship. Meanwhile, Elle (Yasmin Finney) and Tao\u2019s (William Gao) will-they-won\u2019t-they saga continues to sizzle, and a school trip to Paris turns into a crucible for everyone\u2019s emotions. Although it steps into slightly darker terrain this season, the brilliant adaptation of Alice Oseman\u2019s graphic novels continues to be an utter delight\u2014the show younger LGBTQ+ viewers need now, older ones needed years ago, and that everyone needs to watch whatever your sexuality.\n\nCobra Kai\n\nWhile this latter day sequel to The Karate Kid films of the 1980s started life on YouTube Red (remember that?), it\u2019s really come into its own since moving to Netflix. Picking up decades after Daniel LaRusso and Johnny Lawrence\u2019s iconic fight at the end of the first movie, the debut season of Cobra Kai finds the tables turned, with Daniel living the charmed life while Johnny is washed up. Yet after defending his young neighbor Miguel (Xolo Maridue\u00f1a) in a fight, Johnny finds new meaning by re-opening the eponymous karate dojo and guiding a new generation of students. As the series progresses, the stakes get higher\u2014and frankly, increasingly, gloriously, ludicrous\u2014as rival martial arts schools start cropping up all over California and alliances are forged and broken with alarming regularity. It\u2019s all presented a little bit tongue-in-cheek, and with Ralph Macchio and William Zabka reprising their 1980s roles, the show is an unabashed love letter to the classic action flicks, but thanks to some seriously impressive fights and stunt work, and with a younger cast you can\u2019t help but root for, it\u2019s a retro-styled delight. With a sixth and final season in the works, now is the perfect time to binge the first five.\n\nCunk on Earth\n\nBritish comedy alert: This might not be for you. If, however, you appreciate drier-than-a-desert humor and cringe-inducingly awkward interviews, this is a must-watch. A perfectly framed lampoon of globe-trotting documentaries, Cunk on Earth sees host Philomena Cunk (in reality, comedian Diane Morgan) exploring world history, from the development of agriculture through to the space race, offering deranged insights and skewering real-world experts with incredibly stupid questions along the way. Morgan\u2019s relentlessly deadpan delivery alone makes this five-episode series worth a watch, but it\u2019s those interviews that make this comedy gold.\n\nGlitch\n\nTo those in the northern hemisphere, this Australian supernatural drama might be one of the best kept secrets of the last decade. Centred on a small town in Victoria, an entire community is shaken when seven people rise from their graves, seemingly in perfect health but with no memory of who they are or how they died. As police sergeant James Hayes (Patrick Brammall) and local doctor Elishia McKellar (Genevieve O'Reilly) try to contain and examine \u201cThe Risen,\u201d Hayes\u2019 world is rocked when he learns his own late wife Kate is among them. Over the course of three seasons and 18 episodes, the reasons for the dead\u2019s return is teased out, starting with simply \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhy,\u201d but building up to something that questions the rules of reality. A fantastic ensemble cast and brilliant pacing make this a must-see.\n\nBlack Mirror\n\nAs creator Charlie Brooker recently told WIRED, \u201cBlack Mirror wasn't meant to be \u2018this is what\u2019s going on in technology this week.\u2019 It was always designed to be a more paranoid and weird and hopefully unique show.\u201d And that it is, but rather than displaying what\u2019s going on in technology as it\u2019s happening, the show has a way of beating its viewers to the paranoid punch, addressing dystopian anxieties before they even happen. (Black Mirror was talking about AI long before your mom ever heard of ChatGPT.) There are now six seasons of Brooker's show on Netflix, and if you haven\u2019t watched, now may be the time. How else will you know what you\u2019ll be worried about five years from now?\n\nShe-Ra and the Princesses of Power\n\nOn the planet Etheria, Adora loyally serves the Horde, rising through its ranks with her close friend Catra by her side, until the discovery of a strange sword transforms her into the legendary warrior She-Ra. Learning the truth about the oppressive forces she's served her whole life, Adora joins the Rebellion against the Horde\u2014but can she really turn her back on everything she's ever known? And will Catra ever forgive the betrayal? Developed by ND Stevenson\u2014whose own Nimona delighted viewers as an animated movie on Netflix\u2014the modern She-Ra reimagines the 1980s classic, eschewing the original's connection to He-Man and episodic structure in favor of its own unique mythology and long-form storytelling, packed with complex characters, high stakes, and some powerfully emotional moments. Perfect for fans of Avatar: The Last Airbender or The Legend of Korra, this dazzlingly animated five-season action-fantasy is as compelling for older fans as it is younger viewers\u2014and some of the best LGBTQ+ representation to be found in any medium doesn't hurt either.\n\nQueen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story\n\nA prequel spinoff to Bridgerton\u2014the Shondaland-produced Regency era historical romance that continues to break Netflix viewership records\u2014Queen Charlotte takes viewers back to 1761, exploring how a young Charlotte (India Amarteifio) meets and marries George III (Corey Mylchreest). In typical Bridgerton fashion though, there\u2019s far more going on than a period love story, with the spirited Charlotte initially trying to escape the arranged marriage before learning to navigate the corridors of power\u2014and manage George\u2019s deteriorating mental health. Interspersed with scenes in Bridgerton\u2019s \u201cpresent day\u201d 1817, where the now-formidable stateswoman Queen Charlotte (a returning Golda Rosheuvel) deals with a succession crisis to the throne, this limited series is compulsory viewing for fans of the series, and a great entry point for anyone yet to be wooed by its charms.\n\nInside Man\n\nJefferson Grieff (Stanley Tucci) is a former criminology professor on death row for killing his wife, telling his story to a journalist named Beth (Lydia West). Harry Watling (David Tennant) is an unassuming English vicar, tending to his parishioners. The two men are a world apart\u2014until a horrific misunderstanding leads to Watling trapping a friend of Beth's in his basement. As Watling's situation and mental state deteriorate, Beth turns to the killer for help finding her friend. Created and written by Stephen Moffat, this tense transatlantic thriller has just a dash of The Silence of the Lambs, and with a cast at the top of their game, it\u2019s gripping viewing. Best of all, its tight four episodes mean you can binge it in one go.\n\nThe Diplomat\n\nIf there's a West Wing-shaped hole in your life, look no further than The Diplomat\u2014a tense geopolitical thriller elevated beyond the norms of the genre by a superb central performance by The Americans' Keri Russell as Kate Wyler, newly appointed US ambassador to the UK. Far from being an easy assignment in a friendly country, Kate's role coincides with an attack on a British aircraft carrier, leaving her to defuse an international crisis before it escalates into full-blown war. It's a job that might go easier if her own special relationship with husband Hal (Rufus Sewell) weren't fraying, as his resentment at being demoted leads him to interfere in her efforts. One of Netflix's biggest hits of 2023, The Diplomat has already been renewed for season two.\n\nAlice in Borderland\n\nWhen slacker Ryohei Arisu (Kento Yamazaki) is mysteriously transported to a deserted Tokyo, his keen gaming skills give him an edge navigating a series of lethal games that test intellect as much as physical prowess. Yet after barely scraping through several rounds, Arisu is no closer to uncovering the secrets of this strange borderland, or to finding a way home\u2014and the stakes are about to get even higher. Not only are Arisu and his allies Usagi (Tao Tsuchiya), Kuina (Aya Asahina), and Chishiya (Nijiro Murakami) faced with another gauntlet of sadistic games, but they find themselves caught between rival card suit \u201ccourts\u201d vying for power\u2014and not everyone can be trusted.\n\nWith its willingness to kill off main characters at a moment\u2019s notice, the first season of this gripping adaptation of Haro Aso\u2019s manga kept viewers on tenterhooks throughout. As the long-awaited second season leans further into its twisted Alice in Wonderland imagery, expect more shocking developments in this taut thriller.\n\nArcane\n\nLet's be honest: Animated series based on video games often run the gamut from cheap cash-ins to half-decent if forgettable tie-ins, inaccessible to anyone but hardcore devotees. In contrast, Arcane stands apart from the crowd by making its connections to Riot Games' League of Legends almost optional. While its central figures, orphaned sisters Vi and Jinx, are playable characters in the game, viewers don't need foreknowledge of their story to enjoy this steampunk saga of class war, civil uprising, and the people caught in between. With a gorgeous painterly art style, strong characters, and frequently shocking story beats, Arcane defies its origins to become one of the best animated series in years\u2014and it has racked up plenty of awards, including a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program, to prove it.\n\nThe Sandman\n\nThe Sandman is one of the most beloved comic series of the past 40 years. A dark fantasy about dreams, reality, stories, and the mercurial relationship between them, Neil Gaiman's books have endured as essential reading for goth teens and literati alike. While attempts to bring the saga of Dream of the Endless\u2014sometimes known as Morpheus, immortal embodiment and master of the nightlands, fierce and terrible in his wrath\u2014to the screen have been underway practically since the comic debuted in 1988, this long-in-development Netflix adaptation is worth the wait. It\u2019s a perfect translation of the first two graphic novels in the series and follows Dream (a sombre and imposing Tom Sturridge) as he restores his power and kingdom after being held in captivity for a century by occultists who snared him instead of his sister Death (Kirby Howell-Baptiste). Fittingly, the show has a dreamlike pacing to it, blurring the lines between episodic narratives and longer arcs, and it is as likely to leave viewers crying over a gargoyle\u2019s fate as it is to shock them with the sadistic actions of an escaped nightmare-turned-serial killer named the Corinthian (Boyd Holbrook). The Sandman\u2019s journey to the screen might have been the stuff of restless nights, but the result is a dream you won\u2019t want to wake up from.\n\nStranger Things\n\nNetflix's nostalgic sci-fi/horror series is back for its fourth season, set six months after the Battle of Starcourt and with its core cast separated for the first time. The Byers family and Eleven are off in California, Hopper is still (somehow) in a Russian prison, and the remaining crew are home in Hawkins, Indiana, about to face down a terrifying new threat\u2014high school. Oh, and another incursion from the horrific Upside Down. The Duffer Brothers continue to offer up plenty of 1980s nostalgia for viewers who grew up on a diet of Spielberg, Lucas, and Craven, while upping the stakes with a significant new threat. Expect drama, scares, and\u2014of course\u2014plenty of Dungeons & Dragons as the cult show roars toward its fifth and final season.\n\nRussian Doll\n\nIn Russian Doll, Nadia has one very big problem: Time keeps breaking around her. Season one finds Nadia\u2014played by Natasha Lyonne, who is also a cocreator on the show\u2014dying at her own birthday party, only to wake up there over and over again, trapped in a Groundhog Day-style loop until she can unravel her personalized knot in the space-time continuum. Things only get stranger in season two, where Nadia finds herself traveling back in time to 1982 and inhabiting the body of her own mother\u2014currently heavily pregnant with Nadia herself. Both seasons are funny and thought-provoking, reflecting on personal and generational trauma, all without overegging the potential for philosophical musing.\n\nSquid Game\n\nProduced in Korea, Squid Game blends Hunger Games and Parasite with a battle-royal-style contest. Hundreds of desperate, broke people are recruited to a contest where they can win enough money to never need to worry about their debts again. All they have to do to win the \u20a945.6 billion ($35.8 million) jackpot is complete six children\u2019s games. But it\u2019s not that simple: All the games have a twist, and very few people make it out alive. Squid Game is intense, brutal, and often very graphic, but it is also completely gripping. Netflix\u2019s dubbing isn\u2019t the best in this instance, but the nine episodes are compelling enough to make up for it.\n\nLupin\n\nArs\u00e8ne Lupin, the belle epoque burglar created by French novelist Maurice Leblanc in the early 1900s, is reinvented as Assane Diop, a first-generation Frenchman with a mania for Lupin books and a grudge against the powerful forces who decades ago framed his father for a theft he didn\u2019t commit\u2014and led him to die in prison. Pairing drones, social media bots, and hacking skills with traditional tools of the trade like fake beards, picklocks, and quick wits, Diop hunts down his adversaries as he searches for the truth about his father\u2019s fate. In his spare time, Diop also tries to patch together a crumbling marriage and build a better rapport with his son. Worth watching in the French original, this five-episode series\u2019 strength lies in the dialog, the character development, and the charismatic performance of Omar Sy as Assane. The actual escapades and daring heists are beautifully choreographed, but a lot of the mechanics\u2014how a certain piece of legerdemain worked, when an impenetrable building was infiltrated\u2014are left to the viewer's imagination.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast', 'Matt Kamen', 'Wired Staff', 'Jennifer M.

[machine beeping]\n\nOver the long run, I will lose.\n\nBut if I am able to pick the specific tickers,\n\nthen all of a sudden, rather than sitting at a slot machine,\n\nit's like me sitting at the poker table,\n\nand sometimes at that poker table,\n\nit might happen that I get Pocket Aces,\n\nand while I might get Pocket Aces,\n\nI can never guarantee the outcome of that hand,\n\nbut what it does allow me to do\n\nis occasionally stack the odds in my favor\n\nso that if I bet properly and play my hand right,\n\nin the long run,\n\nit allows me the chance of beating the market.\n\n@Abhishekkar_ asks,\n\nWhy do big traders use so many screens?\n\nIf you've ever seen a picture of a trading floor,\n\nyou know that this is absolutely true.\n\nI myself used six screens for my trading.\n\nWhy do we do this?\n\nIt's because we need to be glued in\n\nand queued into so many different things.\n\nSo on this top left here, you'll see my watch list.\n\nThat will be a list of all the stock tickers\n\nthat I'm looking at that day.\n\nEvery trader has their watch list.\n\nAs part of their preparation for the day,\n\nthey decide what stocks they wanna look at\n\nso that they're really queued in\n\nto how their prices are changing over time.\n\nRight here, that box is the live news.\n\nIt feeds in all the news headlines\n\non a specific stock ticker,\n\nand a lot of that news happens through a Bloomberg terminal.\n\nA Bloomberg terminal and the keyboard is\n\none of the critical pieces of hardware\n\nthat you'll see on a trader's desk.\n\nAll of these color-coded keys really help you interface\n\nwith the Bloomberg software.\n\nIt really comes down to speed and precision,\n\nso that traders can do exactly what they need to do\n\nas quickly as possible.\n\nRight here, we have the Level 2 box.\n\nOn the left, you have all the bids.\n\nThe bids are anybody out there in the world\n\nthat wants to buy that specific stock.\n\nYou can even see the price.\n\nThen on the right side is the ask.\n\nThe ask is the price and size\n\nof every single person out there\n\nthat's looking to sell the stock.\n\nWhen you have the price intersect,\n\nthat's when a transaction occurs.\n\nWhen we look at this stock chart,\n\nthere's a whole lot more to it.\n\nIn fact, there's a whole science essentially of trading,\n\nand that subject is called technical analysis.\n\n@cookiecokss wants to know, What is technical analysis?\n\nTechnical analysis is a really big word\n\nfor essentially the essence of day trading.\n\nWhat we have here is a chart of Tesla.\n\nThis is just Tesla's stock price over time.\n\nThe bars will be green when the price goes up,\n\nthe bars will be red when the price goes down.\n\nAnd so when we look at this specific chart,\n\nthere's a couple things we notice.\n\nFirst, overall, this is what I would call a strong stock.\n\nStock prices are going up and towards the right,\n\nwhich means it's increasing in price.\n\nWe see a little bit of a volume spike around noon,\n\nand then the price spiked as well.\n\nThe most volume tends to occur either at the open\n\nor the close for most stocks.\n\nSo that tells me that something atypical happened there.\n\nI suspect it's very likely that a piece of news occurred\n\nthat drove that price higher,\n\nand increased all the transactions\n\nin the stock at that time.\n\nAnother thing this chart tells me is\n\nwe spent pretty much the whole day above that yellow line,\n\nthe volume-weighted average price,\n\nor VWAP, as us traders like to call it.\n\nIt takes every single transaction\n\nthat occurred in the stock,\n\nit multiplies it by the price,\n\nand you get essentially the average price\n\nbased on the volume that occurred there.\n\nA lot of traders like to think that\n\nif a stock is trading above that VWAP line,\n\nthat's a bullish signal.\n\nIn other words, we suspect that\n\nthe trend might continue higher.\n\nIf a stock is trading below VWAP,\n\nwe take that as a bear signal.\n\nIn other words, we interpret that\n\nas the stock might continue to head lower.\n\n@pmckeough asks,\n\nWhat factors make a stock a good buy in your opinion?\n\nFor the most part,\n\nyou really want to invest for a long horizon,\n\nbecause, over time, the stock market does tend to go up.\n\nHowever, as a trader, we take a much different approach.\n\nAs a day trader, I really want to stick to stocks in play.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nI wanna be trading the stocks with the most volatility,\n\nthe biggest changes in sentiment.\n\nI wanna be trading the AMCs and the GameStops\n\nwhen they're going crazy.\n\nI wanna trade the Reddit IPO.\n\nSo what happens if a stock doesn't move?\n\nTraders can't make money.\n\nSo you can bet that we're really looking for the excitement\n\nand the big moves to make the big money.\n\n@FrostAceReal wants to know,\n\nWhy the [beep] are people buying into GameStop\n\nall of a sudden?\n\nWhy do you want to invest in mid?\n\nAll these meme stocks are amazing opportunities to trade\n\nand make short-term bets\n\nas long as you have the experience\n\nto end up on the right side of it.\n\nSo many people are aware of the GameStop phenomenon,\n\nand the whole movement of so-called meme stocks.\n\nA meme stock is a stock\n\nwhere its price is largely influenced by the whims\n\nof social media and different memes online.\n\nMany might even be familiar with what happened in 2021\n\nwith Keith Gill, a.k.a. @theroaringkitty,\n\nwho is a financial analyst\n\nthat really came to have the belief\n\nthat GameStop shares were undervalued,\n\nand he almost created somewhat of a populist movement\n\nwhere people wanted to buy GameStop,\n\nwhere a lot of large hedge funds and institutions\n\nwere betting against the stock price performance.\n\nIt became this calling of sticking it to the trader man,\n\nand sending that stock to the moon.\n\nIt happened again recently as @theroaringkitty\n\ncame out on Twitter for the first time in years\n\nand tweeted a meme.\n\nAnd GameStop went from $10\n\nto as high as $80 pre-market one day\n\nas a result of that tweet alone.\n\nYou might have heard of friends or coworkers\n\nthat have made money with bets on GameStop or AMC.\n\nWhat we say in stock world is what rises really fast\n\nso often comes crashing down just as fast,\n\nand we saw GameStop tumbling down back to $20.\n\nSo if you're investing in making some of these trades,\n\nyou can lose 100% of your capital very, very quickly.\n\nI highly advise against doing any of those crazy bets\n\nunless you are a skilled trader.\n\n@jtedscott wants to know,\n\nWhy did they choose bear and bull to describe the market?\n\nWhy not bull and scaredy cat,\n\nor bull and chicken?\n\nAs you can see, this good old bull on my desk here,\n\nthe way a bull strikes is it strikes upwards.\n\nAnd a bull market is used to refer to a stock market\n\nwhen prices rise by 20% or more.\n\nOn the other side, though, a bear strikes downwards,\n\nand by technical definition,\n\na bear market is when prices fall from the highs\n\nby 20% or more.\n\nAn example of a bear market is what we saw\n\nduring the Great Recession in 2008,\n\nand even what we saw during the early stages of COVID\n\nin spring 2020 when markets fell precipitously\n\nto try and price in the risk of COVID spreading\n\naround the world.\n\n@Fly_Bry wants to know,\n\nWhat is the Warren Buffet secret to success?\n\nI think many people have heard of Warren Buffett,\n\nand it's because he really has one of the best track records\n\nof investing of all time.\n\nHe has invested through every market cycle imaginable,\n\nevery boom, every bust.\n\nThat knowledge and the hours he spends\n\npouring over financial statements allows him\n\nto have an informational and a psychological advantage\n\nover the rest of the market.\n\nIt's the average person out there\n\nwho wants to follow Warren Buffett-style investing advice.\n\nIndex funds are often the way to go.\n\nYou want to invest for the long run,\n\nyou want to buy more when others are fearful,\n\nand you wanna have the long-time horizon,\n\nand capture the growth and success\n\nof the American economy as a whole.\n\n@Mitesh_Engr asks,\n\nWhat is the driving force for a stock to move?\n\nThe stock price and what causes it to move\n\nis simply whatever people are willing\n\nto buy and sell a stock for.\n\nWhat people need to realize is\n\nso often stock prices don't reflect the true economy,\n\nbut perceptions of where the future economy is going to go.\n\nLet's take a case study.\n\nEveryone out there has heard about this huge AI boom.\n\nSo who will be some of the beneficiaries from this AI boom?\n\nOne of them is Nvidia, which is making a lot of these chips.\n\nSo if you were to look at the share price of Nvidia,\n\nyou're going to see that over the last couple years,\n\nit has just absolutely exploded.\n\nThey're creating so many of the chips\n\nthat powers this AI boom.\n\nA lot of investors want to participate in what they view\n\nto be the future of growth and innovation.\n\nHow many chips will they sell?\n\nWhat will the profit margins for this company be?\n\nAnd what are we willing to pay for it today\n\nto compensate for those unknowns?\n\nThat is what the stock market really does.\n\n@vivbajaj asks, Do you trade stocks based on news?\n\nYes, yes, and yes.\n\nPart of our job as traders is to figure out\n\nwhat are the implications of that news,\n\nand then what does it do to the stock price?\n\nAt the start of the war in Ukraine,\n\nwe saw investors rightfully start to panic\n\ndue to the increased geopolitical risk.\n\nOn one of those days, Tesla sold off\n\nalong with the rest of the stock market.\n\nBut then what happened is, later in the day,\n\nwhen some of the fears settled,\n\npeople started to buy Tesla on the second implication,\n\nwhich is, if oil prices shoot higher,\n\nwhat might the implications be\n\nfor electric vehicle adoption over time,\n\nand the prospects of Tesla as a company.\n\n@AngeloTerzo2 wants to know,\n\nIs the trend really your friend?\n\nI would say a resounding yes.\n\nIt is so, so, so important to stay with the trend.\n\nOne way that I like to illustrate this point is\n\nwhat I like to call the right side of the V.\n\nEven though A and B are at the same price,\n\nI wanna be on the right side of the V,\n\nbecause this green line is a stock price\n\ngoing down, down, down, down, down,\n\nand at point A, when we're at $50, you still don't know\n\nhow far that stock might still have to fall.\n\nFor all we know, it could go to 40 or 30 or 20.\n\nThat's why it's so much better to buy\n\nat the right side of the V, when you're with the trend.\n\nThat tends to have higher expected value,\n\nbecause now that we're with the trend,\n\nand these trends tend to continue,\n\nthat puts the odds much more in our favor,\n\nand it's a safer way to invest or trade.\n\n@mattryanx wants to know,\n\nOkay, wait, a real stock market question:\n\nhow does the stock of a company in any way actually impact\n\nthe company and its well-being?\n\nWhen a stock goes public for the first time,\n\nthat's called the IPO, or initial public offering.\n\nSo whatever that IPO price is at,\n\nthat's actually the proceeds that the company will get.\n\nSo if the company were to sell 1,000 shares at a $100,\n\nthey would be raising 100,000 bucks.\n\nBut if that stock then went up way, way higher\n\nafter that IPO,\n\nthey actually wouldn't directly benefit from that.\n\nWhile the day-to-day price of the stock\n\ndoesn't directly influence a company,\n\na lot of the shareholders might own some of the stock.\n\nSo this can have implications for morale,\n\nand also just corporate funding decisions\n\nlike whether to raise money through debt,\n\nessentially issue bonds,\n\nor raise money through equity by selling stock.\n\n@Rushabh_Midas asks, Why top stocks are called blue chip?\n\nThe term blue chips comes from the fact\n\nthat back in the day when people were playing poker,\n\nthe most expensive chips were the blue chips.\n\nThat term was then adapted to refer to stocks\n\nthat were some of the biggest, most profitable, stable,\n\nand respected companies in the economy.\n\nIn the US, we traditionally refer to blue chip stocks\n\nlike GE, or Ford, or General Motors,\n\nbut nowadays it's a different guard\n\nmade up of companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia.\n\n@_marfii wants to know,\n\nSo I'm rewatching 'The Wolf of Wall Street',\n\nany economics nerds on here know\n\nhow accurate it actually is?\n\nIt's definitely a classic.\n\nThat is the true story of Jordan Belfort.\n\nWhat he was a part of is\n\nwhat's called a pump-and-dump scheme.\n\nPeople back then, and still to some degree today,\n\nbuy stocks for themselves and their company,\n\nthen try to pump the stock price up,\n\npromote the stock, and push up the price,\n\nand make a lot of exaggerations to potential investors\n\nthat will get them to buy the stock\n\nat a much higher price than you bought it for.\n\nCreating all this excitement and almost false narrative\n\nto suck people in to buying the stock that you have\n\nwith a huge conflict of interest\n\nin that you're often selling it to them\n\nat a higher price.\n\n@keepkwizing wants to know,\n\nWhat are some stocks that can give 1,000% returns\n\nin the next three years?\n\nA lot of people in the stock market world,\n\nespecially with Instagram and TikTok,\n\nthey're going to promise you things\n\nthat are totally, totally impossible.\n\nMuch like poker, this is a probabilistic game.\n\nI can identify situations that are in my favor,\n\nbut never ever would I be able\n\nto promise anyone anything like,\n\noh, this stock will return 100%,\n\nor let alone 1,000% in a couple years.\n\nAnybody that's making these dramaticized claims,\n\na lot of that is not only not true,\n\nbut some of it might even be illegal.\n\n@chefboyardeej_ asks, How does the stock market crash?\n\nJust uncrash it?\n\nIf only it were that easy.\n\nBut as to why the stock market crashes,\n\nit's because sometimes there's sudden events\n\nthat results in this feedback loop\n\nwhere so many people wanna go for the exit all at once.\n\nWe have an expression in trader world,\n\nit's okay to panic as long as you're gonna be\n\nthe first person out the door.\n\nBut if everybody's already exited,\n\nand prices have dropped precipitously,\n\nthen it's just too late,\n\nand you often are better off sitting tight.\n\nOne example of probably the biggest stock market crash is\n\nin October 19th, 1987, Black Monday.\n\nThe stock market fell a whopping 22% in a single day.\n\nThat is almost unfathomable for me to imagine.\n\n@VoltBoltTrade wants to know,\n\nWhat can emotional trading or psychological pressure\n\ndo to your trading in the financial market?\n\nThe reality of being a trader is that\n\nit is one of the most emotionally\n\nand psychologically challenging jobs out there.\n\nSo often the average layman will be selling\n\nduring the panics when we wanna be buying.\n\nSo what a pro trader does is\n\nwe override those base-level emotions,\n\nand we try to buy when people panic,\n\nand then sell when people get euphoric.\n\nHere's a scene from Billions I really love\n\nthat portrays this topic well.\n\nYou've got to be able to withstand the pressure\n\nor it'll crush you.\n\nHere in this scene, he's saying,\n\nI don't lie to myself. I don't lie to myself.\n\nI don't hold onto a loser. I don't hold onto a loser.\n\nI let it go, get away from it.\n\nIf you have years or decades of experience,\n\nyour intuition is actually giving you very useful knowledge,\n\ntelling you that something is not acting right.\n\nAnd when that happens,\n\nI try to always listen to my intuition.\n\n@slimmerella_ says, Imma be real for a sec.\n\nI have absolutely no idea\n\nhow the New York Stock Exchange works.\n\nLike I don't get why everyone is just running around\n\nyelling in earpieces.\n\nI just feel like there's a more calm way\n\nwe can tackle this?\n\nI totally agree, @slimmerella_,\n\nand a lot of that craziness, and the running around,\n\nand the screaming and yelling has actually gone\n\nthe way of the past.\n\nYes, some floor trading does still exist.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange still has their floor,\n\nand their different areas for some of the different stocks,\n\nbut the overwhelming majority of stock trading is all done\n\nthrough electronic trading using software and the internet.\n\nThat being said, it is true that\n\nwhen you see those people yelling and screaming,\n\na lot of those people are taking in orders,\n\nsome still by phone even,\n\nand they're trying to process them through the system\n\nto eventually find the best way to place them in the market,\n\nand get the best pricing for their client.\n\n@PerceptivTrader asks,\n\nWhat sets apart pro traders from amateurs?\n\nThe difference between elite and amateur is massive.\n\nA lot of what a trader succeeds at is pattern recognition.\n\nThe more experience you have,\n\nyou can notice all these nuances\n\nthat an amateur doesn't stand a chance at noticing.\n\nThe same way that Tom Brady can read a defense,\n\nand know where people are going to move before they do it.\n\nIt's that difference versus being a high school quarterback.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nInvesting always involves risk,\n\nso do your own research or consult a financial advisor\n\nbefore making any investment decisions.\n\nThanks for watching Stock Market Support.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image": "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill,d_placeholder_wired.png,fl_progressive,g_face,h_1080,q_80,w_1920/v1719251886/wired_tech-support-stock-trader-answers-stock-market-questions-from-twitter.jpg", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.wired.com/video/watch/tech-support-stock-trader-answers-stock-market-questions-from-twitter", "timestamp": "1719366891.396202", "displayed": 0}

possible.\n\nRight here, we have the Level 2 box.\n\nOn the left, you have all the bids.\n\nThe bids are anybody out there in the world\n\nthat wants to buy that specific stock.\n\nYou can even see the price.\n\nThen on the right side is the ask.\n\nThe ask is the price and size\n\nof every single person out there\n\nthat's looking to sell the stock.\n\nWhen you have the price intersect,\n\nthat's when a transaction occurs.\n\nWhen we look at this stock chart,\n\nthere's a whole lot more to it.\n\nIn fact, there's a whole science essentially of trading,\n\nand that subject is called technical analysis.\n\n@cookiecokss wants to know, What is technical analysis?\n\nTechnical analysis is a really big word\n\nfor essentially the essence of day trading.\n\nWhat we have here is a chart of Tesla.\n\nThis is just Tesla's stock price over time.\n\nThe bars will be green when the price goes up,\n\nthe bars will be red when the price goes down.\n\nAnd so when we look at this specific chart,\n\nthere's a couple things we notice.\n\nFirst, overall, this is what I would call a strong stock.\n\nStock prices are going up and towards the right,\n\nwhich means it's increasing in price.\n\nWe see a little bit of a volume spike around noon,\n\nand then the price spiked as well.\n\nThe most volume tends to occur either at the open\n\nor the close for most stocks.\n\nSo that tells me that something atypical happened there.\n\nI suspect it's very likely that a piece of news occurred\n\nthat drove that price higher,\n\nand increased all the transactions\n\nin the stock at that time.\n\nAnother thing this chart tells me is\n\nwe spent pretty much the whole day above that yellow line,\n\nthe volume-weighted average price,\n\nor VWAP, as us traders like to call it.\n\nIt takes every single transaction\n\nthat occurred in the stock,\n\nit multiplies it by the price,\n\nand you get essentially the average price\n\nbased on the volume that occurred there.\n\nA lot of traders like to think that\n\nif a stock is trading above that VWAP line,\n\nthat's a bullish signal.\n\nIn other words, we suspect that\n\nthe trend might continue higher.\n\nIf a stock is trading below VWAP,\n\nwe take that as a bear signal.\n\nIn other words, we interpret that\n\nas the stock might continue to head lower.\n\n@pmckeough asks,\n\nWhat factors make a stock a good buy in your opinion?\n\nFor the most part,\n\nyou really want to invest for a long horizon,\n\nbecause, over time, the stock market does tend to go up.\n\nHowever, as a trader, we take a much different approach.\n\nAs a day trader, I really want to stick to stocks in play.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nI wanna be trading the stocks with the most volatility,\n\nthe biggest changes in sentiment.\n\nI wanna be trading the AMCs and the GameStops\n\nwhen they're going crazy.\n\nI wanna trade the Reddit IPO.\n\nSo what happens if a stock doesn't move?\n\nTraders can't make money.\n\nSo you can bet that we're really looking for the excitement\n\nand the big moves to make the big money.\n\n@FrostAceReal wants to know,\n\nWhy the [beep] are people buying into GameStop\n\nall of a sudden?\n\nWhy do you want to invest in mid?\n\nAll these meme stocks are amazing opportunities to trade\n\nand make short-term bets\n\nas long as you have the experience\n\nto end up on the right side of it.\n\nSo many people are aware of the GameStop phenomenon,\n\nand the whole movement of so-called meme stocks.\n\nA meme stock is a stock\n\nwhere its price is largely influenced by the whims\n\nof social media and different memes online.\n\nMany might even be familiar with what happened in 2021\n\nwith Keith Gill, a.k.a. @theroaringkitty,\n\nwho is a financial analyst\n\nthat really came to have the belief\n\nthat GameStop shares were undervalued,\n\nand he almost created somewhat of a populist movement\n\nwhere people wanted to buy GameStop,\n\nwhere a lot of large hedge funds and institutions\n\nwere betting against the stock price performance.\n\nIt became this calling of sticking it to the trader man,\n\nand sending that stock to the moon.\n\nIt happened again recently as @theroaringkitty\n\ncame out on Twitter for the first time in years\n\nand tweeted a meme.\n\nAnd GameStop went from $10\n\nto as high as $80 pre-market one day\n\nas a result of that tweet alone.\n\nYou might have heard of friends or coworkers\n\nthat have made money with bets on GameStop or AMC.\n\nWhat we say in stock world is what rises really fast\n\nso often comes crashing down just as fast,\n\nand we saw GameStop tumbling down back to $20.\n\nSo if you're investing in making some of these trades,\n\nyou can lose 100% of your capital very, very quickly.\n\nI highly advise against doing any of those crazy bets\n\nunless you are a skilled trader.\n\n@jtedscott wants to know,\n\nWhy did they choose bear and bull to describe the market?\n\nWhy not bull and scaredy cat,\n\nor bull and chicken?\n\nAs you can see, this good old bull on my desk here,\n\nthe way a bull strikes is it strikes upwards.\n\nAnd a bull market is used to refer to a stock market\n\nwhen prices rise by 20% or more.\n\nOn the other side, though, a bear strikes downwards,\n\nand by technical definition,\n\na bear market is when prices fall from the highs\n\nby 20% or more.\n\nAn example of a bear market is what we saw\n\nduring the Great Recession in 2008,\n\nand even what we saw during the early stages of COVID\n\nin spring 2020 when markets fell precipitously\n\nto try and price in the risk of COVID spreading\n\naround the world.\n\n@Fly_Bry wants to know,\n\nWhat is the Warren Buffet secret to success?\n\nI think many people have heard of Warren Buffett,\n\nand it's because he really has one of the best track records\n\nof investing of all time.\n\nHe has invested through every market cycle imaginable,\n\nevery boom, every bust.\n\nThat knowledge and the hours he spends\n\npouring over financial statements allows him\n\nto have an informational and a psychological advantage\n\nover the rest of the market.\n\nIt's the average person out there\n\nwho wants to follow Warren Buffett-style investing advice.\n\nIndex funds are often the way to go.\n\nYou want to invest for the long run,\n\nyou want to buy more when others are fearful,\n\nand you wanna have the long-time horizon,\n\nand capture the growth and success\n\nof the American economy as a whole.\n\n@Mitesh_Engr asks,\n\nWhat is the driving force for a stock to move?\n\nThe stock price and what causes it to move\n\nis simply whatever people are willing\n\nto buy and sell a stock for.\n\nWhat people need to realize is\n\nso often stock prices don't reflect the true economy,\n\nbut perceptions of where the future economy is going to go.\n\nLet's take a case study.\n\nEveryone out there has heard about this huge AI boom.\n\nSo who will be some of the beneficiaries from this AI boom?\n\nOne of them is Nvidia, which is making a lot of these chips.\n\nSo if you were to look at the share price of Nvidia,\n\nyou're going to see that over the last couple years,\n\nit has just absolutely exploded.\n\nThey're creating so many of the chips\n\nthat powers this AI boom.\n\nA lot of investors want to participate in what they view\n\nto be the future of growth and innovation.\n\nHow many chips will they sell?\n\nWhat will the profit margins for this company be?\n\nAnd what are we willing to pay for it today\n\nto compensate for those unknowns?\n\nThat is what the stock market really does.\n\n@vivbajaj asks, Do you trade stocks based on news?\n\nYes, yes, and yes.\n\nPart of our job as traders is to figure out\n\nwhat are the implications of that news,\n\nand then what does it do to the stock price?\n\nAt the start of the war in Ukraine,\n\nwe saw investors rightfully start to panic\n\ndue to the increased geopolitical risk.\n\nOn one of those days, Tesla sold off\n\nalong with the rest of the stock market.\n\nBut then what happened is, later in the day,\n\nwhen some of the fears settled,\n\npeople started to buy Tesla on the second implication,\n\nwhich is, if oil prices shoot higher,\n\nwhat might the implications be\n\nfor electric vehicle adoption over time,\n\nand the prospects of Tesla as a company.\n\n@AngeloTerzo2 wants to know,\n\nIs the trend really your friend?\n\nI would say a resounding yes.\n\nIt is so, so, so important to stay with the trend.\n\nOne way that I like to illustrate this point is\n\nwhat I like to call the right side of the V.\n\nEven though A and B are at the same price,\n\nI wanna be on the right side of the V,\n\nbecause this green line is a stock price\n\ngoing down, down, down, down, down,\n\nand at point A, when we're at $50, you still don't know\n\nhow far that stock might still have to fall.\n\nFor all we know, it could go to 40 or 30 or 20.\n\nThat's why it's so much better to buy\n\nat the right side of the V, when you're with the trend.\n\nThat tends to have higher expected value,\n\nbecause now that we're with the trend,\n\nand these trends tend to continue,\n\nthat puts the odds much more in our favor,\n\nand it's a safer way to invest or trade.\n\n@mattryanx wants to know,\n\nOkay, wait, a real stock market question:\n\nhow does the stock of a company in any way actually impact\n\nthe company and its well-being?\n\nWhen a stock goes public for the first time,\n\nthat's called the IPO, or initial public offering.\n\nSo whatever that IPO price is at,\n\nthat's actually the proceeds that the company will get.\n\nSo if the company were to sell 1,000 shares at a $100,\n\nthey would be raising 100,000 bucks.\n\nBut if that stock then went up way, way higher\n\nafter that IPO,\n\nthey actually wouldn't directly benefit from that.\n\nWhile the day-to-day price of the stock\n\ndoesn't directly influence a company,\n\na lot of the shareholders might own some of the stock.\n\nSo this can have implications for morale,\n\nand also just corporate funding decisions\n\nlike whether to raise money through debt,\n\nessentially issue bonds,\n\nor raise money through equity by selling stock.\n\n@Rushabh_Midas asks, Why top stocks are called blue chip?\n\nThe term blue chips comes from the fact\n\nthat back in the day when people were playing poker,\n\nthe most expensive chips were the blue chips.\n\nThat term was then adapted to refer to stocks\n\nthat were some of the biggest, most profitable, stable,\n\nand respected companies in the economy.\n\nIn the US, we traditionally refer to blue chip stocks\n\nlike GE, or Ford, or General Motors,\n\nbut nowadays it's a different guard\n\nmade up of companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia.\n\n@_marfii wants to know,\n\nSo I'm rewatching 'The Wolf of Wall Street',\n\nany economics nerds on here know\n\nhow accurate it actually is?\n\nIt's definitely a classic.\n\nThat is the true story of Jordan Belfort.\n\nWhat he was a part of is\n\nwhat's called a pump-and-dump scheme.\n\nPeople back then, and still to some degree today,\n\nbuy stocks for themselves and their company,\n\nthen try to pump the stock price up,\n\npromote the stock, and push up the price,\n\nand make a lot of exaggerations to potential investors\n\nthat will get them to buy the stock\n\nat a much higher price than you bought it for.\n\nCreating all this excitement and almost false narrative\n\nto suck people in to buying the stock that you have\n\nwith a huge conflict of interest\n\nin that you're often selling it to them\n\nat a higher price.\n\n@keepkwizing wants to know,\n\nWhat are some stocks that can give 1,000% returns\n\nin the next three years?\n\nA lot of people in the stock market world,\n\nespecially with Instagram and TikTok,\n\nthey're going to promise you things\n\nthat are totally, totally impossible.\n\nMuch like poker, this is a probabilistic game.\n\nI can identify situations that are in my favor,\n\nbut never ever would I be able\n\nto promise anyone anything like,\n\noh, this stock will return 100%,\n\nor let alone 1,000% in a couple years.\n\nAnybody that's making these dramaticized claims,\n\na lot of that is not only not true,\n\nbut some of it might even be illegal.\n\n@chefboyardeej_ asks, How does the stock market crash?\n\nJust uncrash it?\n\nIf only it were that easy.\n\nBut as to why the stock market crashes,\n\nit's because sometimes there's sudden events\n\nthat results in this feedback loop\n\nwhere so many people wanna go for the exit all at once.\n\nWe have an expression in trader world,\n\nit's okay to panic as long as you're gonna be\n\nthe first person out the door.\n\nBut if everybody's already exited,\n\nand prices have dropped precipitously,\n\nthen it's just too late,\n\nand you often are better off sitting tight.\n\nOne example of probably the biggest stock market crash is\n\nin October 19th, 1987, Black Monday.\n\nThe stock market fell a whopping 22% in a single day.\n\nThat is almost unfathomable for me to imagine.\n\n@VoltBoltTrade wants to know,\n\nWhat can emotional trading or psychological pressure\n\ndo to your trading in the financial market?\n\nThe reality of being a trader is that\n\nit is one of the most emotionally\n\nand psychologically challenging jobs out there.\n\nSo often the average layman will be selling\n\nduring the panics when we wanna be buying.\n\nSo what a pro trader does is\n\nwe override those base-level emotions,\n\nand we try to buy when people panic,\n\nand then sell when people get euphoric.\n\nHere's a scene from Billions I really love\n\nthat portrays this topic well.\n\nYou've got to be able to withstand the pressure\n\nor it'll crush you.\n\nHere in this scene, he's saying,\n\nI don't lie to myself. I don't lie to myself.\n\nI don't hold onto a loser. I don't hold onto a loser.\n\nI let it go, get away from it.\n\nIf you have years or decades of experience,\n\nyour intuition is actually giving you very useful knowledge,\n\ntelling you that something is not acting right.\n\nAnd when that happens,\n\nI try to always listen to my intuition.\n\n@slimmerella_ says, Imma be real for a sec.\n\nI have absolutely no idea\n\nhow the New York Stock Exchange works.\n\nLike I don't get why everyone is just running around\n\nyelling in earpieces.\n\nI just feel like there's a more calm way\n\nwe can tackle this?\n\nI totally agree, @slimmerella_,\n\nand a lot of that craziness, and the running around,\n\nand the screaming and yelling has actually gone\n\nthe way of the past.\n\nYes, some floor trading does still exist.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange still has their floor,\n\nand their different areas for some of the different stocks,\n\nbut the overwhelming majority of stock trading is all done\n\nthrough electronic trading using software and the internet.\n\nThat being said, it is true that\n\nwhen you see those people yelling and screaming,\n\na lot of those people are taking in orders,\n\nsome still by phone even,\n\nand they're trying to process them through the system\n\nto eventually find the best way to place them in the market,\n\nand get the best pricing for their client.\n\n@PerceptivTrader asks,\n\nWhat sets apart pro traders from amateurs?\n\nThe difference between elite and amateur is massive.\n\nA lot of what a trader succeeds at is pattern recognition.\n\nThe more experience you have,\n\nyou can notice all these nuances\n\nthat an amateur doesn't stand a chance at noticing.\n\nThe same way that Tom Brady can read a defense,\n\nand know where people are going to move before they do it.\n\nIt's that difference versus being a high school quarterback.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nInvesting always involves risk,\n\nso do your own research or consult a financial advisor\n\nbefore making any investment decisions.\n\nThanks for watching Stock Market Support.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image": "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill,d_placeholder_wired.png,fl_progressive,g_face,h_1080,q_80,w_1920/v1719251886/wired_tech-support-stock-trader-answers-stock-market-questions-from-twitter.jpg", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.wired.com/video/watch/tech-support-stock-trader-answers-stock-market-questions-from-twitter", "timestamp": "1719366892.087438", "displayed": 0}
{"title": "Hayden Christensen Answers The Web's Most Searched Questions", "text": "Transcript\n\nHello, I'm Hayden Christensen\n\nand this is my Wired Autocomplete Interview.\n\n[dramatic music]\n\nI ever Google myself?\n\nWhen I was a bit younger, but it's been a very long time.\n\nIt was all surprising and shocking and I never did it again.\n\n[dramatic music]\n\nAll right, what do we have here?\n\nDid Hayden Christensen watch the 'Clone Wars?' I did.\n\nI watched The Clone Wars\n\nwhen I was coming back to Star Wars\n\nto get ready for the Obi-Wan Kenobi show.\n\nI was just sort of reimmersing myself\n\nin all things Star Wars.\n\nAnd I thought they did a great job with these characters\n\nand brought in some new characters.\n\nAnd really great storytelling.\n\nHow did Hayden Christensen\n\nget the role of Anakin Skywalker?\n\nI auditioned for it.\n\nLike, a lot of other people\n\nI went in and I met with the casting director first.\n\nAnd then I went to the Skywalker Ranch\n\nand I got to meet with George Lucas, which was thrilling.\n\nAnd then I got to go back to the Skywalker Ranch\n\nand I auditioned with Natalie Portman.\n\nMaybe a few days later,\n\nI got one of the best phone calls of my life,\n\nsaying that I got the part.\n\nJust a lot of training to figure out the lightsaber stuff.\n\nYou know, they knew that I had some athletic inclinations.\n\nI played a lot of hockey and tennis as a kid,\n\nso I thought maybe I'd be able\n\nto pick up a lightsaber and handle myself.\n\nBut it was a lot of time spent with Nick Gillard,\n\nthe fight choreographer of the prequels.\n\nAnd that was some of my favorite stuff was, you know,\n\ngoing to Jedi training camp\n\nand learning how to fight with a lightsaber.\n\nWhen did Hayden Christensen play Darth Vader?\n\nI played Darth Vader when we did Revenge of the Sith,\n\nvery briefly at the end of that film.\n\nAnd then I got to play him again when we came back\n\nto do the Obi-Wan Kenobi show just recently.\n\nIt was a great thrill, you know.\n\nI'd spent a lot of time playing Anakin,\n\nbut to get to sort of spend some time as Darth Vader\n\nwas a nice continuation of my journey with the character.\n\nWill Hayden Christensen play Anakin again?\n\nThat would be a lot of fun.\n\nI think that the answer to that question remains to be seen.\n\nAll right.\n\nDoes Hayden Christensen go to conventions?\n\nI have started going to conventions.\n\nI didn't for a while. And then I did and I enjoyed it.\n\nAnd I had fun and so now I go every now and then when I can.\n\nDoes Hayden Christensen have social media?\n\nI do not have any social media.\n\nNever say never. Maybe one day.\n\nDid Hayden Christensen like playing Anakin Skywalker?\n\nIs this, yeah, Skywalker.\n\nI did. I loved playing Anakin Skywalker.\n\nJust getting to play a Jedi Knight was so much fun.\n\nPutting that costume on every day\n\nand having a lightsaber hang from your belt\n\nwas a pretty cool thing.\n\nAnd just to play the character that becomes Darth Vader.\n\nHe's got a lot of sort of, you know,\n\ninner conflict and lots of emotions.\n\nHe's always dealing with, you know,\n\nthere's a lot going on underneath the surface.\n\nProbably one of my favorite roles I've ever gotten to play.\n\nI love the character, I love Star Wars,\n\nso yeah, I definitely did.\n\nDoes Hayden Christensen play video games?\n\nI used to play a lot of video games.\n\nNot so much anymore, ever since I became a dad.\n\nI was big into Call of Duty, Halo, and then FIFA.\n\nFIFA was kind of my go-to.\n\nManchester United was the team I usually played with.\n\nDoes Hayden Christensen have any tattoos?\n\nNo. No, I don't have any tattoos.\n\nToo indecisive to commit to a tattoo.\n\nAlright. Is Hayden Christensen Mark Hamill's nephew?\n\nNo, I'm not related to Mark Hamill, in any way.\n\nI've met him a couple times. Great guy.\n\nBut yeah, we are not related.\n\nIs Hayden Christensen a farmer?\n\nNo, I'm not. I'm not actually a farmer.\n\nI do have a farm, or it was a working farm when I bought it,\n\nbut I stopped farming the land.\n\nSo I'm not really a farmer, although I do own a tractor.\n\nI don't know who really owns a tractor other than a farmer,\n\nso it's a gray area.\n\nIs Hayden Christensen a footballer?\n\nNo, not a footballer. I played when I was a little kid.\n\nAnd then I played in a charity match, called Soccer Aid.\n\nAnd I think if you go online\n\nyou can see a video of probably the exact moment\n\nwhen I lost the soccer game for my team.\n\nIt was a close game, it was a tied game,\n\nand then it went to a penalty shootout.\n\nAnd when I went up to do mine,\n\nit just didn't go very well.\n\nAnd the coach actually, his one bit of advice to me\n\nwas to keep it on the ground.\n\nAnd then I went up to strike the ball.\n\nAnd I was just like, I'm gonna give it everything I've got.\n\nAnd I nailed the sucker,\n\nand it just went flying over the net, which is probably\n\nlike a very Anakin thing to do when you think about it.\n\nIs Hayden Christensen CGI in 'Ahsoka?'\n\nNo, I was actually there. That was me.\n\nI was digitally de-aged a little bit,\n\nbut not a computer generated image.\n\nIs Hayden Christensen in 'Rise of Skywalker?'\n\nNo, but my voice is very briefly if you listen closely.\n\nIs Hayden Christensen Danish?\n\nNo, I'm part Swedish. My last name is Danish.\n\nI don't really know how that happened,\n\nbut no, I'm a bit of part Swedish, part Italian,\n\nand then part like English, Irish, Scottish, something.\n\nSort of hard to track.\n\nThat's the end of that one. All right.\n\nWhat was Hayden Christensen's first movie?\n\nMy first movie was a John Carpenter film\n\ncalled In The Mouth of Madness.\n\nI was maybe 12 or 13 at the time. And I was in one scene.\n\nI played a paper boy and it was with Sam Neil.\n\nAnd I was so excited\n\n'cause it was just after Jurassic Park had came out.\n\nAnd so I was really excited\n\nto get to be in a movie with him.\n\nI think I was giving Sam Neil directions.\n\nBoth he and and John Carpenter were very kind people.\n\nAnd I remember John Carpenter\n\ngave me a gift basket at the end of the day.\n\nAnd a very nice hand handwritten card,\n\nwhich I think I still have somewhere.\n\nWhat is Hayden Christensen's favorite song?\n\nI don't know that I have a favorite song.\n\nIt's hard to pick just one.\n\nWhen I was a kid,\n\nlike, if you ask me when I was like nine or 10 years old,\n\nI would've said Great Balls of Fire by Jerry Lee Lewis.\n\nIt was one of the first songs\n\nI learned to play on the piano.\n\nAnd I performed at a family member's wedding one time\n\nwhen I was quite young.\n\nAnd then I also used to really love\n\nFaith by George Michael.\n\nAnytime that came on the radio,\n\nwhen I was like driving the car with my mom,\n\nI used to rock out to that song.\n\nWhat school did Hayden Christensen go to?\n\nI went to Unionville High School in Ontario, Canada.\n\nAnd it was a really good school.\n\nIt was a public school, but it had an arts program\n\nwithin the sort of mainstream high school.\n\nAnd I went to the theater program there.\n\nAnd we did like half a year studying Shakespeare,\n\nand I got to play Hamlet.\n\nI really sort of connected with the role.\n\nAnd that was definitely a moment for me\n\nwhere I thought like, this would be something\n\nI'd really like to continue with\n\nand maybe try to make a profession out of.\n\nFor sure, there's lots of comparisons\n\nyou can make to Hamlet and Anakin.\n\nThey're both very sort of impulsive characters\n\nwho tend to sort of act before they think.\n\nI've certainly been accused of that myself too.\n\nBut yeah, there's lots of similarities there.\n\nMaybe that helped me in my pursuit of playing Anakin.\n\nWhat languages does Hayden Christensen speak?\n\nSadly, I really only speak English.\n\nI wish I was multilingual.\n\nBut I can speak a little bit of French, not very well.\n\nBut in Canada it's, you know,\n\na part of the sort of mandatory curriculum\n\nthat you study French up until grade nine.\n\nAnd then after grade nine I didn't continue with it.\n\nI'd be able to fake my way\n\nthrough ordering at a French restaurant.\n\nBut as soon as I get into a conversation with someone,\n\nthen they pretty quickly realize that it's not a language\n\nI should really be communicating in.\n\nBonjour, comment ca va? All right, next up.\n\nHow old was Hayden Christensen\n\nduring 'Revenge of the Sith?'\n\nI think I was about 22 years old\n\nwhen I did Revenge of the Sith\n\nor when we started the filming on those.\n\nWould go on for a couple of years,\n\nso I was probably 22, 23 when I did that.\n\nWhere is Hayden Christensen from?\n\nI'm from Canada. I was born in Vancouver, Canada.\n\nAnd then my family moved to Toronto\n\nwhen I was like five years old.\n\nAnd I grew up in the suburbs of Toronto.\n\nAre Hayden Christensen Ewan McGregor friends?\n\nYeah. Yeah, we are friends. I love Ewan.\n\nHe's a great guy, great actor.\n\nAnd it was so nice to get to come back\n\nand do the Obi-Wan show with him.\n\nAnd now we see each other every now and then,\n\nand it's been really nice.\n\nSo yes, we are friends.\n\nCan Hayden Christensen play the piano?\n\nYeah. Yeah, I can play the piano.\n\nI took a lot of piano lessons when I was a kid\n\nand I learned how to play sort of jazz and blues,\n\nwhich was my interest.\n\nI can't read any, you know, sheet music or anything,\n\nbut I can sit down and have some fun at the piano.\n\nThere's a lot of people don't know about me,\n\nsome interesting things to be curious about.\n\nThank you Wired. This was fun.\n\nI hope you learned something.

I did.\n\nI watched The Clone Wars\n\nwhen I was coming back to Star Wars\n\nto get ready for the Obi-Wan Kenobi show.\n\nI was just sort of reimmersing myself\n\nin all things Star Wars.\n\nAnd I thought they did a great job with these characters\n\nand brought in some new characters.\n\nAnd really great storytelling.\n\nHow did Hayden Christensen\n\nget the role of Anakin Skywalker?\n\nI auditioned for it.\n\nLike, a lot of other people\n\nI went in and I met with the casting director first.\n\nAnd then I went to the Skywalker Ranch\n\nand I got to meet with George Lucas, which was thrilling.\n\nAnd then I got to go back to the Skywalker Ranch\n\nand I auditioned with Natalie Portman.\n\nMaybe a few days later,\n\nI got one of the best phone calls of my life,\n\nsaying that I got the part.\n\nJust a lot of training to figure out the lightsaber stuff.\n\nYou know, they knew that I had some athletic inclinations.\n\nI played a lot of hockey and tennis as a kid,\n\nso I thought maybe I'd be able\n\nto pick up a lightsaber and handle myself.\n\nBut it was a lot of time spent with Nick Gillard,\n\nthe fight choreographer of the prequels.\n\nAnd that was some of my favorite stuff was, you know,\n\ngoing to Jedi training camp\n\nand learning how to fight with a lightsaber.\n\nWhen did Hayden Christensen play Darth Vader?\n\nI played Darth Vader when we did Revenge of the Sith,\n\nvery briefly at the end of that film.\n\nAnd then I got to play him again when we came back\n\nto do the Obi-Wan Kenobi show just recently.\n\nIt was a great thrill, you know.\n\nI'd spent a lot of time playing Anakin,\n\nbut to get to sort of spend some time as Darth Vader\n\nwas a nice continuation of my journey with the character.\n\nWill Hayden Christensen play Anakin again?\n\nThat would be a lot of fun.\n\nI think that the answer to that question remains to be seen.\n\nAll right.\n\nDoes Hayden Christensen go to conventions?\n\nI have started going to conventions.\n\nI didn't for a while. And then I did and I enjoyed it.\n\nAnd I had fun and so now I go every now and then when I can.\n\nDoes Hayden Christensen have social media?\n\nI do not have any social media.\n\nNever say never. Maybe one day.\n\nDid Hayden Christensen like playing Anakin Skywalker?\n\nIs this, yeah, Skywalker.\n\nI did. I loved playing Anakin Skywalker.\n\nJust getting to play a Jedi Knight was so much fun.\n\nPutting that costume on every day\n\nand having a lightsaber hang from your belt\n\nwas a pretty cool thing.\n\nAnd just to play the character that becomes Darth Vader.\n\nHe's got a lot of sort of, you know,\n\ninner conflict and lots of emotions.\n\nHe's always dealing with, you know,\n\nthere's a lot going on underneath the surface.\n\nProbably one of my favorite roles I've ever gotten to play.\n\nI love the character, I love Star Wars,\n\nso yeah, I definitely did.\n\nDoes Hayden Christensen play video games?\n\nI used to play a lot of video games.\n\nNot so much anymore, ever since I became a dad.\n\nI was big into Call of Duty, Halo, and then FIFA.\n\nFIFA was kind of my go-to.\n\nManchester United was the team I usually played with.\n\nDoes Hayden Christensen have any tattoos?\n\nNo. No, I don't have any tattoos.\n\nToo indecisive to commit to a tattoo.\n\nAlright. Is Hayden Christensen Mark Hamill's nephew?\n\nNo, I'm not related to Mark Hamill, in any way.\n\nI've met him a couple times. Great guy.\n\nBut yeah, we are not related.\n\nIs Hayden Christensen a farmer?\n\nNo, I'm not. I'm not actually a farmer.\n\nI do have a farm, or it was a working farm when I bought it,\n\nbut I stopped farming the land.\n\nSo I'm not really a farmer, although I do own a tractor.\n\nI don't know who really owns a tractor other than a farmer,\n\nso it's a gray area.\n\nIs Hayden Christensen a footballer?\n\nNo, not a footballer. I played when I was a little kid.\n\nAnd then I played in a charity match, called Soccer Aid.\n\nAnd I think if you go online\n\nyou can see a video of probably the exact moment\n\nwhen I lost the soccer game for my team.\n\nIt was a close game, it was a tied game,\n\nand then it went to a penalty shootout.\n\nAnd when I went up to do mine,\n\nit just didn't go very well.\n\nAnd the coach actually, his one bit of advice to me\n\nwas to keep it on the ground.\n\nAnd then I went up to strike the ball.\n\nAnd I was just like, I'm gonna give it everything I've got.\n\nAnd I nailed the sucker,\n\nand it just went flying over the net, which is probably\n\nlike a very Anakin thing to do when you think about it.\n\nIs Hayden Christensen CGI in 'Ahsoka?'\n\nNo, I was actually there. That was me.\n\nI was digitally de-aged a little bit,\n\nbut not a computer generated image.\n\nIs Hayden Christensen in 'Rise of Skywalker?'\n\nNo, but my voice is very briefly if you listen closely.\n\nIs Hayden Christensen Danish?\n\nNo, I'm part Swedish. My last name is Danish.\n\nI don't really know how that happened,\n\nbut no, I'm a bit of part Swedish, part Italian,\n\nand then part like English, Irish, Scottish, something.\n\nSort of hard to track.\n\nThat's the end of that one. All right.\n\nWhat was Hayden Christensen's first movie?\n\nMy first movie was a John Carpenter film\n\ncalled In The Mouth of Madness.\n\nI was maybe 12 or 13 at the time. And I was in one scene.\n\nI played a paper boy and it was with Sam Neil.\n\nAnd I was so excited\n\n'cause it was just after Jurassic Park had came out.\n\nAnd so I was really excited\n\nto get to be in a movie with him.\n\nI think I was giving Sam Neil directions.\n\nBoth he and and John Carpenter were very kind people.\n\nAnd I remember John Carpenter\n\ngave me a gift basket at the end of the day.\n\nAnd a very nice hand handwritten card,\n\nwhich I think I still have somewhere.\n\nWhat is Hayden Christensen's favorite song?\n\nI don't know that I have a favorite song.\n\nIt's hard to pick just one.\n\nWhen I was a kid,\n\nlike, if you ask me when I was like nine or 10 years old,\n\nI would've said Great Balls of Fire by Jerry Lee Lewis.\n\nIt was one of the first songs\n\nI learned to play on the piano.\n\nAnd I performed at a family member's wedding one time\n\nwhen I was quite young.\n\nAnd then I also used to really love\n\nFaith by George Michael.\n\nAnytime that came on the radio,\n\nwhen I was like driving the car with my mom,\n\nI used to rock out to that song.\n\nWhat school did Hayden Christensen go to?\n\nI went to Unionville High School in Ontario, Canada.\n\nAnd it was a really good school.\n\nIt was a public school, but it had an arts program\n\nwithin the sort of mainstream high school.\n\nAnd I went to the theater program there.\n\nAnd we did like half a year studying Shakespeare,\n\nand I got to play Hamlet.\n\nI really sort of connected with the role.\n\nAnd that was definitely a moment for me\n\nwhere I thought like, this would be something\n\nI'd really like to continue with\n\nand maybe try to make a profession out of.\n\nFor sure, there's lots of comparisons\n\nyou can make to Hamlet and Anakin.\n\nThey're both very sort of impulsive characters\n\nwho tend to sort of act before they think.\n\nI've certainly been accused of that myself too.\n\nBut yeah, there's lots of similarities there.\n\nMaybe that helped me in my pursuit of playing Anakin.\n\nWhat languages does Hayden Christensen speak?\n\nSadly, I really only speak English.\n\nI wish I was multilingual.\n\nBut I can speak a little bit of French, not very well.\n\nBut in Canada it's, you know,\n\na part of the sort of mandatory curriculum\n\nthat you study French up until grade nine.\n\nAnd then after grade nine I didn't continue with it.\n\nI'd be able to fake my way\n\nthrough ordering at a French restaurant.\n\nBut as soon as I get into a conversation with someone,\n\nthen they pretty quickly realize that it's not a language\n\nI should really be communicating in.\n\nBonjour, comment ca va? All right, next up.\n\nHow old was Hayden Christensen\n\nduring 'Revenge of the Sith?'\n\nI think I was about 22 years old\n\nwhen I did Revenge of the Sith\n\nor when we started the filming on those.\n\nWould go on for a couple of years,\n\nso I was probably 22, 23 when I did that.\n\nWhere is Hayden Christensen from?\n\nI'm from Canada. I was born in Vancouver, Canada.\n\nAnd then my family moved to Toronto\n\nwhen I was like five years old.\n\nAnd I grew up in the suburbs of Toronto.\n\nAre Hayden Christensen Ewan McGregor friends?\n\nYeah. Yeah, we are friends. I love Ewan.\n\nHe's a great guy, great actor.\n\nAnd it was so nice to get to come back\n\nand do the Obi-Wan show with him.\n\nAnd now we see each other every now and then,\n\nand it's been really nice.\n\nSo yes, we are friends.\n\nCan Hayden Christensen play the piano?\n\nYeah. Yeah, I can play the piano.\n\nI took a lot of piano lessons when I was a kid\n\nand I learned how to play sort of jazz and blues,\n\nwhich was my interest.\n\nI can't read any, you know, sheet music or anything,\n\nbut I can sit down and have some fun at the piano.\n\nThere's a lot of people don't know about me,\n\nsome interesting things to be curious about.\n\nThank you Wired. This was fun.\n\nI hope you learned something.

Martin borrowed liberally\n\nfrom medieval history.\n\nThe Red Wedding itself is based on Scottish history.\n\nIn 1440, the young King of Scotland\n\ninvited the young leaders of the Douglas clan\n\nto dine with him.\n\nWhen you're invited into the feast hall,\n\nyou dine with the king.\n\nThe code of hospitality should maintain\n\nthat no Ill can come to you,\n\nand instead they were betrayed and beheaded.\n\nLike in Game of Thrones,\n\nmuch of the contest over the throne\n\nhas to do with rival factions\n\nthat maybe to some degree or another\n\nare related to one another.\n\nGeorge R.R. Martin took as his template for this\n\nthe late medieval conflict known as the Wars of the Roses.\n\nYou have the Lancaster cousins against the York cousins.\n\nAnd in the show, the Lannisters have a name\n\nthat sounds very much like Lancaster,\n\nand the Starks, with their one syllable name,\n\nthat name chimes nicely with York.\n\nAs far as characters go, the mad Targaryen king\n\nwould seem to be a pretty clear analog\n\nto King Henry VI, who suffered bouts of madness.\n\nCercei Lannister very much resembles Margaret of Anjou,\n\nHenry VI's queen.\n\nHer son was probably not the son of Henry VI.\n\nHenry VI himself commented that he could not remember\n\nwhen the conception had happened\n\nand that it must have been a miracle.\n\nThis, of course, seems to be very much\n\nlike the situation with Cercei,\n\nwhose children are not that of Robert Baratheon,\n\nbut are indeed the children of herself\n\nand her twin brother, Jaime Lannister.\n\n@sulliscomrade asks, do I have narcolepsy\n\nor do I just have the natural sleep cycle\n\nof a medieval peasant?\n\nSleep? in the Middle Ages was very different\n\nfrom sleep today.\n\nPeople in the Middle Ages generally slept biphasically,\n\nwhich means in two stages.\n\nSo there was what was called the first sleep.\n\nIf you're in a natural sleep rhythm\n\nthat does not have any exposure to unnatural light,\n\nyou'll fall asleep when the sun goes down,\n\nyou will sleep for a few hours,\n\nand then you might get up and maybe around 11, midnight,\n\nmight do some chores, might have sex,\n\nyou might visit your neighbors.\n\nIn early castles,\n\nthe lord and lady usually slept in the Great Hall\n\nbehind where they would sit at table for great feasts.\n\nAll of the king's retainers and loyal warriors\n\nwould also sleep in that same room.\n\nThere might be a screen separating their sleeping quarters\n\nfrom the rest of the hall,\n\nbut there was not a ton of privacy.\n\nThen usually around 2:00 a.m. or so,\n\nyou might enter what's called the second sleep,\n\nand this sleep would go until the sun came up\n\nand you would arise\n\nand get ready to do your chores or your work for the day.\n\nIt's not until the advent of electricity\n\nand people are able to work longer hours\n\nand they need to compress their sleep into one single block\n\nthat we see people sleeping, say,\n\nfrom 10:00 pm. to 6:00 a.m.,\n\nand that is not a natural cycle.\n\n@rahsoose asks, honestly,\n\nwhy do medieval people have so many torture devices?\n\nWhat the [beep] was wrong with those people?\n\nFirst of all, they did not have all those torture devices.\n\nYes, they had some,\n\nbut most torture devices you see came into use\n\nor were invented after the Middle Ages\n\nor they're completely fabricated,\n\nespecially by people in the 19th century\n\nwho for some reason wanted to imagine the Middle Ages\n\nas a time of savagery and barbarism\n\nso by contrast they seemed much more civilized.\n\nSo, for example, you might have the Rack.\n\nThat might be legit.\n\nThere is no Iron Maiden.\n\nThere is no Spanish Tickler.\n\nThere were no chastity belts.\n\nAny chastity belt you have seen in a museum is a fake!\n\n@MedievalScholar asks,\n\nwhat is your favorite medieval castle?\n\nThis is a tough question to answer because I have about 20.\n\nThe top of my list is Windsor Castle.\n\nIt is a great example of a motte-and-bailey castle.\n\nBasically, a motte-and-bailey castle has two parts.\n\nFirst, there would be an earthen mound.\n\nOn top of that, you would build a keep.\n\nBelow and in front of the keep would be the bailey section,\n\nand this is where all the activity\n\nof the household would happen.\n\nA motte-and-bailey castle\n\nwould also have another layer outside that enclosure,\n\nwhich would be a moat.\n\nIf you are a knight in armor,\n\nthe last thing you probably want to do\n\nis swim across the moat.\n\nThe moat also prevents the enemy\n\nfrom tunneling under the castle walls to get to the keep.\n\nIf the enemy forces push through the bailey,\n\nthen everyone retreats into the keep.\n\nFor the most part, a castle was defensive.\n\nIt was not luxurious.\n\nThere are, for example, no hallways in castles.\n\nHallways come about with the advent of the palace,\n\nwhich is post-medieval.\n\nAnd because of this there's really no privacy.\n\n@Shark3143 asks,\n\ndid medieval kings ever just piss in the moat or what?\n\nAbsolutely, and it's not just kings!\n\nToilets tended to be a very, very small sort of closet\n\nthat jutted out over the edge of the walls,\n\nsometimes over the moat,\n\nsometimes just down into a courtyard\n\nand some poor guy had to clean it up.\n\nThese were also called garderobes.\n\nGarderobe means in French, a place to keep your robe,\n\nand if you hung your clothes in the garderobe\n\nnext to all the ammonia scent from the urine,\n\nyou were less likely to get mites\n\nand other creepy crawlies in your clothes.\n\n@Wheezy_814 says,\n\ncould y'all imagine the [beep] swampass people had\n\nduring the medieval times?\n\nYes, in the Middle Ages,\n\nyou absolutely were smelling your neighbors\n\nmuch more than you are today,\n\nbut it is a myth that they were completely unsanitary.\n\nPlenty of medieval cities had bathhouses,\n\nwhere a caller would go through the streets\n\nannouncing when the water was hot.\n\nIn certain medieval communities like Strasbourg,\n\nif you were a civil servant,\n\npart of your salary went towards\n\nbeing able to use the bathhouse once a week\n\nso you could get clean.\n\nIt did smell bad, there were open sewers,\n\nbut it was not as bad as some people might believe.\n\n@cavemanpaints asks,\n\nhow did humanity survive the Black Death\n\nwithout vaccines?\n\nThey did not.\n\nMost of them died.\n\nIf we look at the mortality rate for the Black Death,\n\nwe see that it's something like 80%,\n\nand that means if you contracted plague,\n\nyou had maybe an 18-20% chance of surviving.\n\nOtherwise, you were dead.\n\nThe first big wave, which was about 1346 to 1353,\n\nwipes out half of the population, we now estimate.\n\nThe population didn't have any chance to rebound\n\nbecause plague kept coming back\n\nover and over again up, until 1721.\n\nAnd by the way, if you have seen images\n\nthat supposedly represent what plague doctors looked like,\n\nin sort of a primitive hazmat suit,\n\nno one wore those plague masks in the Middle Ages.\n\nYou should know that that is anachronistic.\n\nIt is wrong.\n\nThat probably came into being\n\nsometime around the 17th century.\n\n@i_love_ur_mom3 says, Hansel and Gretel is brutal.\n\nDid parents even love their children?\n\nInfant mortality was so high in the Middle Ages\n\nthat you might think there's no way\n\nmedieval parents could attach any affection\n\nto children who are very likely to die.\n\nEvidence now shows\n\nthat medieval people seem to have loved their children\n\njust as much as modern people do,\n\nthat they mourned when they died,\n\nthat they worried over them when they were sick.\n\nInfant mortality rates before the first year of life\n\nare somewhere around 80%,\n\nbut if you made it past age five,\n\nthere's no reason why you couldn't live into your sixties,\n\neven seventies, and, in some cases, eighties.\n\nThe rate of infant mortality skews lifespan averages\n\nin the Middle Ages\n\nso that it looks like totally healthy people\n\nare walking around and at age 35, they keel over and die.\n\nThat's not the case.\n\nSince you mentioned Hansel and Gretel,\n\nthis story and other stories like Red Riding Hood\n\nhave one purpose,\n\nto teach your children not to go into the woods.\n\nDangers in the woods include, for example, wolves.\n\nThat was a very large danger.\n\nOn the Continent and in England,\n\nyou also have all kinds of outlaws living in the woods.\n\nThey made their living by thievery, looting,\n\nand all kinds of other unsavory practices\n\n@StrongbowBeleg asks, I must ask,\n\ndid medieval artists actually know what animals look like?\n\nThis image is from the Aberdeen Bestiary.\n\nThese are cats.\n\nYes, indeed, they did know what cats looked like.\n\nWe know that they had cats\n\nand that cats were acting then like cats do now\n\nbecause we have evidence of paw prints,\n\nwalking across medieval manuscripts.\n\nWe do have a medieval manuscript\n\nin which a cat apparently peed on the page\n\nand the monk circled it\n\nand noted which cat had done this to the manuscript.\n\nThe way things were drawn or rendered\n\nwas not meant to be a realistic representation.\n\nIt was meant to be symbolic, flat, 2-D,\n\nand often would have lots of signals or clues\n\nthat had hidden meanings,\n\nespecially in manuscript illuminations.\n\nAnd if you're going for a three-dimensional,\n\nrealistic portrayal, that's not quite as easy to do.\n\n@agneponx asks, how [beep] boring would it have been\n\nto be born in medieval times?\n\nWhat the hell did they do for fun?\n\nThey played all kinds of ball games\n\nthat would involve kicking\n\nor hitting something like an inflated pig's bladder\n\nwith a stick.\n\nLawn bowling, where they would roll smooth stones\n\nto knock someone else's ball out of the way.\n\nThey also played board games.\n\nThere's a game called Fox and Geese\n\nthat's sort of a strategy game.\n\nAnd they played chess.\n\nHere we have an example of a chess piece\n\nfrom the famous Isle of Lewis chess set,\n\nwhich was fashioned out of walrus ivory\n\nsometime in the 12th century.\n\n@atothe_d asks, did medieval court jesters actually exist?\n\nSeems fake.\n\nDoes seem fake, but it's not.\n\nCourt jesters absolutely existed.\n\nThey provided some much needed entertainment,\n\nboth for the king and for nobles assembled at court,\n\nespecially on feast days.\n\nOne famous court jester\n\nwho was at the court of King Henry II\n\nwas asked every year during the Christmas holidays\n\nto put on his signature performance,\n\nwhich was a leap, a whistle, and a fart.\n\nBut jesters, or fools as they were sometimes called,\n\nmight be there just for entertainment, juggling, antics.\n\nOthers might be the individual who was the only individual\n\nwho could speak truth to the king\n\nwithout fear of getting beheaded.\n\nBecause this position of fool or jester was meant\n\non one level not to be taken seriously,\n\nthese individuals could get away\n\nwith giving the king advice or information\n\nor saying things that other people at court just could not.\n\n@kenziexlittle asks,\n\nhow the [beep] did jousting become a thing?\n\nJousting started out as a very necessary, pragmatic activity\n\nthat was to train young knights for warfare.\n\nOver time, however, jousting became something of a spectacle\n\nand this eventually developed\n\ninto the full-fledged tournament,\n\none of which we see in the beginning\n\nof House of the Dragon.\n\nThe basics are there,\n\ntwo knights riding at each other on horseback\n\nwith a very small barrier in between\n\nto keep them to either side of what are known as the lists.\n\nHouse of the Dragon has some of the lower classes there.\n\nThis wouldn't have been the case in the Middle Ages.\n\nThis was really something that the upper classes attended\n\nand the lower classes might be present\n\nas food vendors or sellers of other goods\n\noutside the tournament arena, but not inside.\n\nBoydell & Brewer asks,\n\ndid you know that in Medieval England,\n\nanimals could be tried and convicted of crimes?\n\nThere are records of animals being taken to court.\n\nAnd yes, indeed, there are.\n\nIf an animal had caused damage to crops\n\nor to other livestock or had injured a person,\n\nvery often the animal could be put on trial.\n\nAnd in this case,\n\nthey were often thought to be possessed by Satan\n\nwhen they did these terrible things.\n\nEven more interesting than animals on trial, though,\n\nis the case of animals who became saints.\n\nIn 13th century France,\n\nthere is the story of the Sainted Greyhound,\n\nand this is a story in which the lord of a castle\n\nleaves his young son in a cradle while he goes out hunting\n\nand when he comes back,\n\nhe finds the son's room is a disaster.\n\nThere's blood everywhere.\n\nThe cradle's been overturned.\n\nThe dog has blood on its muzzle,\n\nand so the Lord thinks that the dog has killed his son,\n\nso he kills the greyhound, flips over the cradle,\n\nand finds that, in fact, what the dog had done\n\nwas protect the child from a snake.\n\nAnd the lord feels so bad\n\nthat he creates a shrine to this greyhound,\n\nand her name is Saint Guinefort, and pretty soon,\n\nshe becomes a local patron saint to children.\n\nAnd a little bit later the Catholic church said,\n\nno, you are not allowed to have animal saints.\n\nWhat is wrong with you people?!\n\n@NeffliesStuff asks, Was there a real King Arthur?\n\nMaybe?\n\nIn about 1191, the monks at Glastonbury Abbey claim\n\nthat they have found the grave of King Arthur.\n\nAnd the monks report that in the coffin they discovered,\n\nthere was a very large man\n\nwho had died from an ax blow to the head\n\nand they know it's Arthur's grave\n\nbecause on it is this leaden cross,\n\nand engraved on the cross in sort of very early script,\n\nhere lies buried the renowned King Arthur\n\nin the Isle of Avalon.\n\nNow, in the 20th century,\n\narcheologists excavated where the monks said they had dug\n\nand they found out that, indeed, they had excavated someone.\n\nWhether or not it was actually King Arthur, we don't know.\n\nThe cross itself has been lost.\n\nOne clue that works in favor of this\n\nis the spelling of Arthur's name, Artorius,\n\nwhich is a really early spelling.\n\nIf you were gonna dummy up a cross\n\nto say you found the grave of Arthur in the 12th century,\n\nyou'd probably spell it Artus.\n\nAlso, the shape of the letters\n\nseem to be earlier than 12th century,\n\nalthough, again, that could be part of the forgery.\n\n@XavierTorch asks, did medieval knights name their swords?\n\nBecause that's big in fiction.\n\nIn the medieval tradition,\n\nthe most famous sword is Excalibur,\n\nwhich belongs to King Arthur.\n\nOther medieval individuals who had actual named swords\n\ninclude Charlemagne, who had Joyeuse,\n\nhis nephew, Roland, Durandal.\n\nSome of these would be passed from generation to generation,\n\nand that's one reason why they would have names.\n\nPhysical objects such as the sword\n\nwould help to identify that person\n\nas the new head of the household.\n\n@IreneC_Bgv says, why did the Vikings attack?\n\nWhy these farmers and fishermen suddenly decided\n\nto go looting and pillaging has to do with the possibility\n\nthat maybe the farmland they were working\n\nwas no longer quite as fertile,\n\nand perhaps population had increased to the point\n\nthat you had what's called this youth bulge,\n\nwhere there's too many young men\n\nand not enough for them to do.\n\nWhatever the reason, at the end of the eighth century,\n\nthe Vikings start to move out\n\nfrom what we think of as their home territory\n\nhere in Scandinavia.\n\nAll of these blue pins on the map indicate places\n\nwhere they either set up settlements\n\nor they raided frequently.\n\nThey made most of their money\n\nlooting Christian churches and monasteries.\n\nThe Vikings were not Christian,\n\nso they didn't know what these big structures were,\n\nfull of men who couldn't or wouldn't fight,\n\nexcept for they seemed to be full\n\nof lots of nice, shiny things.\n\nThey sailed up the Seine and attacked Paris.\n\nMade it all the way to the Middle East.\n\nAnd if we go back to France, this area is Normandy.\n\nWhy is it called Normandy?\n\nBecause that is where the north men settled.\n\nThere was almost nowhere that the Vikings did not go\n\nin the Middle Ages.\n\nOh, here's a good one.\n\nWho is your favorite influential woman in history?\n\nI have several favorite medieval women.\n\nRight at the top though has got to be Eleanor of Aquitaine,\n\nwho famously was married\n\nto both the French king and the English king\n\nand was mother to two more kings.\n\nEleanor was the heiress of the huge Duchy of Aquitaine,\n\nwhich is in what today is southern France.\n\nShe was married off to the French king.\n\nOvernight, that almost doubled the size of France.\n\nBut the French king wasn't a great king.\n\nHe would've made a great priest.\n\nEleanor, coming from the south,\n\nwhich was the land of troubadours\n\nand chivalry and courtly love\n\nand where women had much more power and influence,\n\nreally was not having a great time up north in Paris,\n\nwhere people were much more serious.\n\nShe and the French king had two children,\n\nbut after a certain point,\n\nit was clear that this was not working\n\nand they got the Pope to annul their marriage.\n\nOnce she was free,\n\nEleanor wrote to the young Prince Henry,\n\nletting him know that she was available\n\nshould he be interested, and he was.\n\nShe marries Henry\n\nand had an additional eight to ten pregnancies.\n\nShe is the mother of the famous Richard the Lionheart\n\nand the infamous King John.\n\nShe was busy up until the very end of her life.\n\nShe died when she was about 80 years old.\n\n@coveredinliz asks, what did the Holy Grail even do?\n\nJust a pretty cup?\n\nIt is such an important religious object.\n\nEither the cup that Christ drank from at the Last Supper\n\nand/or the cup that Joseph of Arimathea used\n\nto catch Christ's blood when he was on the cross.\n\nWhat's fascinating about the grail legend\n\nin the Arthurian stories\n\nis that no one ever really succeeds.\n\nIn fact, the only knight\n\nwho really has a true measure of success is Sir Galahad.\n\nHe gets to see the grail and when he does see it,\n\nwe are told in Sir Thomas Malory's Morte d'Arthur\n\nthat Galahad had sees something\n\nand we don't get to know what it is.\n\nHis flesh begins to tremble\n\nwhen he beholds these spiritual things\n\nand then he dies and gets taken up to heaven,\n\nwith the grail!\n\nFor everyone else,\n\nthe quest is pretty much a dismal failure.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nThanks very much for watching Medieval Support.\n\n[no audio]", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image":

name\n\nthat sounds very much like Lancaster,\n\nand the Starks, with their one syllable name,\n\nthat name chimes nicely with York.\n\nAs far as characters go, the mad Targaryen king\n\nwould seem to be a pretty clear analog\n\nto King Henry VI, who suffered bouts of madness.\n\nCercei Lannister very much resembles Margaret of Anjou,\n\nHenry VI's queen.\n\nHer son was probably not the son of Henry VI.\n\nHenry VI himself commented that he could not remember\n\nwhen the conception had happened\n\nand that it must have been a miracle.\n\nThis, of course, seems to be very much\n\nlike the situation with Cercei,\n\nwhose children are not that of Robert Baratheon,\n\nbut are indeed the children of herself\n\nand her twin brother, Jaime Lannister.\n\n@sulliscomrade asks, do I have narcolepsy\n\nor do I just have the natural sleep cycle\n\nof a medieval peasant?\n\nSleep? in the Middle Ages was very different\n\nfrom sleep today.\n\nPeople in the Middle Ages generally slept biphasically,\n\nwhich means in two stages.\n\nSo there was what was called the first sleep.\n\nIf you're in a natural sleep rhythm\n\nthat does not have any exposure to unnatural light,\n\nyou'll fall asleep when the sun goes down,\n\nyou will sleep for a few hours,\n\nand then you might get up and maybe around 11, midnight,\n\nmight do some chores, might have sex,\n\nyou might visit your neighbors.\n\nIn early castles,\n\nthe lord and lady usually slept in the Great Hall\n\nbehind where they would sit at table for great feasts.\n\nAll of the king's retainers and loyal warriors\n\nwould also sleep in that same room.\n\nThere might be a screen separating their sleeping quarters\n\nfrom the rest of the hall,\n\nbut there was not a ton of privacy.\n\nThen usually around 2:00 a.m. or so,\n\nyou might enter what's called the second sleep,\n\nand this sleep would go until the sun came up\n\nand you would arise\n\nand get ready to do your chores or your work for the day.\n\nIt's not until the advent of electricity\n\nand people are able to work longer hours\n\nand they need to compress their sleep into one single block\n\nthat we see people sleeping, say,\n\nfrom 10:00 pm. to 6:00 a.m.,\n\nand that is not a natural cycle.\n\n@rahsoose asks, honestly,\n\nwhy do medieval people have so many torture devices?\n\nWhat the [beep] was wrong with those people?\n\nFirst of all, they did not have all those torture devices.\n\nYes, they had some,\n\nbut most torture devices you see came into use\n\nor were invented after the Middle Ages\n\nor they're completely fabricated,\n\nespecially by people in the 19th century\n\nwho for some reason wanted to imagine the Middle Ages\n\nas a time of savagery and barbarism\n\nso by contrast they seemed much more civilized.\n\nSo, for example, you might have the Rack.\n\nThat might be legit.\n\nThere is no Iron Maiden.\n\nThere is no Spanish Tickler.\n\nThere were no chastity belts.\n\nAny chastity belt you have seen in a museum is a fake!\n\n@MedievalScholar asks,\n\nwhat is your favorite medieval castle?\n\nThis is a tough question to answer because I have about 20.\n\nThe top of my list is Windsor Castle.\n\nIt is a great example of a motte-and-bailey castle.\n\nBasically, a motte-and-bailey castle has two parts.\n\nFirst, there would be an earthen mound.\n\nOn top of that, you would build a keep.\n\nBelow and in front of the keep would be the bailey section,\n\nand this is where all the activity\n\nof the household would happen.\n\nA motte-and-bailey castle\n\nwould also have another layer outside that enclosure,\n\nwhich would be a moat.\n\nIf you are a knight in armor,\n\nthe last thing you probably want to do\n\nis swim across the moat.\n\nThe moat also prevents the enemy\n\nfrom tunneling under the castle walls to get to the keep.\n\nIf the enemy forces push through the bailey,\n\nthen everyone retreats into the keep.\n\nFor the most part, a castle was defensive.\n\nIt was not luxurious.\n\nThere are, for example, no hallways in castles.\n\nHallways come about with the advent of the palace,\n\nwhich is post-medieval.\n\nAnd because of this there's really no privacy.\n\n@Shark3143 asks,\n\ndid medieval kings ever just piss in the moat or what?\n\nAbsolutely, and it's not just kings!\n\nToilets tended to be a very, very small sort of closet\n\nthat jutted out over the edge of the walls,\n\nsometimes over the moat,\n\nsometimes just down into a courtyard\n\nand some poor guy had to clean it up.\n\nThese were also called garderobes.\n\nGarderobe means in French, a place to keep your robe,\n\nand if you hung your clothes in the garderobe\n\nnext to all the ammonia scent from the urine,\n\nyou were less likely to get mites\n\nand other creepy crawlies in your clothes.\n\n@Wheezy_814 says,\n\ncould y'all imagine the [beep] swampass people had\n\nduring the medieval times?\n\nYes, in the Middle Ages,\n\nyou absolutely were smelling your neighbors\n\nmuch more than you are today,\n\nbut it is a myth that they were completely unsanitary.\n\nPlenty of medieval cities had bathhouses,\n\nwhere a caller would go through the streets\n\nannouncing when the water was hot.\n\nIn certain medieval communities like Strasbourg,\n\nif you were a civil servant,\n\npart of your salary went towards\n\nbeing able to use the bathhouse once a week\n\nso you could get clean.\n\nIt did smell bad, there were open sewers,\n\nbut it was not as bad as some people might believe.\n\n@cavemanpaints asks,\n\nhow did humanity survive the Black Death\n\nwithout vaccines?\n\nThey did not.\n\nMost of them died.\n\nIf we look at the mortality rate for the Black Death,\n\nwe see that it's something like 80%,\n\nand that means if you contracted plague,\n\nyou had maybe an 18-20% chance of surviving.\n\nOtherwise, you were dead.\n\nThe first big wave, which was about 1346 to 1353,\n\nwipes out half of the population, we now estimate.\n\nThe population didn't have any chance to rebound\n\nbecause plague kept coming back\n\nover and over again up, until 1721.\n\nAnd by the way, if you have seen images\n\nthat supposedly represent what plague doctors looked like,\n\nin sort of a primitive hazmat suit,\n\nno one wore those plague masks in the Middle Ages.\n\nYou should know that that is anachronistic.\n\nIt is wrong.\n\nThat probably came into being\n\nsometime around the 17th century.\n\n@i_love_ur_mom3 says, Hansel and Gretel is brutal.\n\nDid parents even love their children?\n\nInfant mortality was so high in the Middle Ages\n\nthat you might think there's no way\n\nmedieval parents could attach any affection\n\nto children who are very likely to die.\n\nEvidence now shows\n\nthat medieval people seem to have loved their children\n\njust as much as modern people do,\n\nthat they mourned when they died,\n\nthat they worried over them when they were sick.\n\nInfant mortality rates before the first year of life\n\nare somewhere around 80%,\n\nbut if you made it past age five,\n\nthere's no reason why you couldn't live into your sixties,\n\neven seventies, and, in some cases, eighties.\n\nThe rate of infant mortality skews lifespan averages\n\nin the Middle Ages\n\nso that it looks like totally healthy people\n\nare walking around and at age 35, they keel over and die.\n\nThat's not the case.\n\nSince you mentioned Hansel and Gretel,\n\nthis story and other stories like Red Riding Hood\n\nhave one purpose,\n\nto teach your children not to go into the woods.\n\nDangers in the woods include, for example, wolves.\n\nThat was a very large danger.\n\nOn the Continent and in England,\n\nyou also have all kinds of outlaws living in the woods.\n\nThey made their living by thievery, looting,\n\nand all kinds of other unsavory practices\n\n@StrongbowBeleg asks, I must ask,\n\ndid medieval artists actually know what animals look like?\n\nThis image is from the Aberdeen Bestiary.\n\nThese are cats.\n\nYes, indeed, they did know what cats looked like.\n\nWe know that they had cats\n\nand that cats were acting then like cats do now\n\nbecause we have evidence of paw prints,\n\nwalking across medieval manuscripts.\n\nWe do have a medieval manuscript\n\nin which a cat apparently peed on the page\n\nand the monk circled it\n\nand noted which cat had done this to the manuscript.\n\nThe way things were drawn or rendered\n\nwas not meant to be a realistic representation.\n\nIt was meant to be symbolic, flat, 2-D,\n\nand often would have lots of signals or clues\n\nthat had hidden meanings,\n\nespecially in manuscript illuminations.\n\nAnd if you're going for a three-dimensional,\n\nrealistic portrayal, that's not quite as easy to do.\n\n@agneponx asks, how [beep] boring would it have been\n\nto be born in medieval times?\n\nWhat the hell did they do for fun?\n\nThey played all kinds of ball games\n\nthat would involve kicking\n\nor hitting something like an inflated pig's bladder\n\nwith a stick.\n\nLawn bowling, where they would roll smooth stones\n\nto knock someone else's ball out of the way.\n\nThey also played board games.\n\nThere's a game called Fox and Geese\n\nthat's sort of a strategy game.\n\nAnd they played chess.\n\nHere we have an example of a chess piece\n\nfrom the famous Isle of Lewis chess set,\n\nwhich was fashioned out of walrus ivory\n\nsometime in the 12th century.\n\n@atothe_d asks, did medieval court jesters actually exist?\n\nSeems fake.\n\nDoes seem fake, but it's not.\n\nCourt jesters absolutely existed.\n\nThey provided some much needed entertainment,\n\nboth for the king and for nobles assembled at court,\n\nespecially on feast days.\n\nOne famous court jester\n\nwho was at the court of King Henry II\n\nwas asked every year during the Christmas holidays\n\nto put on his signature performance,\n\nwhich was a leap, a whistle, and a fart.\n\nBut jesters, or fools as they were sometimes called,\n\nmight be there just for entertainment, juggling, antics.\n\nOthers might be the individual who was the only individual\n\nwho could speak truth to the king\n\nwithout fear of getting beheaded.\n\nBecause this position of fool or jester was meant\n\non one level not to be taken seriously,\n\nthese individuals could get away\n\nwith giving the king advice or information\n\nor saying things that other people at court just could not.\n\n@kenziexlittle asks,\n\nhow the [beep] did jousting become a thing?\n\nJousting started out as a very necessary, pragmatic activity\n\nthat was to train young knights for warfare.\n\nOver time, however, jousting became something of a spectacle\n\nand this eventually developed\n\ninto the full-fledged tournament,\n\none of which we see in the beginning\n\nof House of the Dragon.\n\nThe basics are there,\n\ntwo knights riding at each other on horseback\n\nwith a very small barrier in between\n\nto keep them to either side of what are known as the lists.\n\nHouse of the Dragon has some of the lower classes there.\n\nThis wouldn't have been the case in the Middle Ages.\n\nThis was really something that the upper classes attended\n\nand the lower classes might be present\n\nas food vendors or sellers of other goods\n\noutside the tournament arena, but not inside.\n\nBoydell & Brewer asks,\n\ndid you know that in Medieval England,\n\nanimals could be tried and convicted of crimes?\n\nThere are records of animals being taken to court.\n\nAnd yes, indeed, there are.\n\nIf an animal had caused damage to crops\n\nor to other livestock or had injured a person,\n\nvery often the animal could be put on trial.\n\nAnd in this case,\n\nthey were often thought to be possessed by Satan\n\nwhen they did these terrible things.\n\nEven more interesting than animals on trial, though,\n\nis the case of animals who became saints.\n\nIn 13th century France,\n\nthere is the story of the Sainted Greyhound,\n\nand this is a story in which the lord of a castle\n\nleaves his young son in a cradle while he goes out hunting\n\nand when he comes back,\n\nhe finds the son's room is a disaster.\n\nThere's blood everywhere.\n\nThe cradle's been overturned.\n\nThe dog has blood on its muzzle,\n\nand so the Lord thinks that the dog has killed his son,\n\nso he kills the greyhound, flips over the cradle,\n\nand finds that, in fact, what the dog had done\n\nwas protect the child from a snake.\n\nAnd the lord feels so bad\n\nthat he creates a shrine to this greyhound,\n\nand her name is Saint Guinefort, and pretty soon,\n\nshe becomes a local patron saint to children.\n\nAnd a little bit later the Catholic church said,\n\nno, you are not allowed to have animal saints.\n\nWhat is wrong with you people?!\n\n@NeffliesStuff asks, Was there a real King Arthur?\n\nMaybe?\n\nIn about 1191, the monks at Glastonbury Abbey claim\n\nthat they have found the grave of King Arthur.\n\nAnd the monks report that in the coffin they discovered,\n\nthere was a very large man\n\nwho had died from an ax blow to the head\n\nand they know it's Arthur's grave\n\nbecause on it is this leaden cross,\n\nand engraved on the cross in sort of very early script,\n\nhere lies buried the renowned King Arthur\n\nin the Isle of Avalon.\n\nNow, in the 20th century,\n\narcheologists excavated where the monks said they had dug\n\nand they found out that, indeed, they had excavated someone.\n\nWhether or not it was actually King Arthur, we don't know.\n\nThe cross itself has been lost.\n\nOne clue that works in favor of this\n\nis the spelling of Arthur's name, Artorius,\n\nwhich is a really early spelling.\n\nIf you were gonna dummy up a cross\n\nto say you found the grave of Arthur in the 12th century,\n\nyou'd probably spell it Artus.\n\nAlso, the shape of the letters\n\nseem to be earlier than 12th century,\n\nalthough, again, that could be part of the forgery.\n\n@XavierTorch asks, did medieval knights name their swords?\n\nBecause that's big in fiction.\n\nIn the medieval tradition,\n\nthe most famous sword is Excalibur,\n\nwhich belongs to King Arthur.\n\nOther medieval individuals who had actual named swords\n\ninclude Charlemagne, who had Joyeuse,\n\nhis nephew, Roland, Durandal.\n\nSome of these would be passed from generation to generation,\n\nand that's one reason why they would have names.\n\nPhysical objects such as the sword\n\nwould help to identify that person\n\nas the new head of the household.\n\n@IreneC_Bgv says, why did the Vikings attack?\n\nWhy these farmers and fishermen suddenly decided\n\nto go looting and pillaging has to do with the possibility\n\nthat maybe the farmland they were working\n\nwas no longer quite as fertile,\n\nand perhaps population had increased to the point\n\nthat you had what's called this youth bulge,\n\nwhere there's too many young men\n\nand not enough for them to do.\n\nWhatever the reason, at the end of the eighth century,\n\nthe Vikings start to move out\n\nfrom what we think of as their home territory\n\nhere in Scandinavia.\n\nAll of these blue pins on the map indicate places\n\nwhere they either set up settlements\n\nor they raided frequently.\n\nThey made most of their money\n\nlooting Christian churches and monasteries.\n\nThe Vikings were not Christian,\n\nso they didn't know what these big structures were,\n\nfull of men who couldn't or wouldn't fight,\n\nexcept for they seemed to be full\n\nof lots of nice, shiny things.\n\nThey sailed up the Seine and attacked Paris.\n\nMade it all the way to the Middle East.\n\nAnd if we go back to France, this area is Normandy.\n\nWhy is it called Normandy?\n\nBecause that is where the north men settled.\n\nThere was almost nowhere that the Vikings did not go\n\nin the Middle Ages.\n\nOh, here's a good one.\n\nWho is your favorite influential woman in history?\n\nI have several favorite medieval women.\n\nRight at the top though has got to be Eleanor of Aquitaine,\n\nwho famously was married\n\nto both the French king and the English king\n\nand was mother to two more kings.\n\nEleanor was the heiress of the huge Duchy of Aquitaine,\n\nwhich is in what today is southern France.\n\nShe was married off to the French king.\n\nOvernight, that almost doubled the size of France.\n\nBut the French king wasn't a great king.\n\nHe would've made a great priest.\n\nEleanor, coming from the south,\n\nwhich was the land of troubadours\n\nand chivalry and courtly love\n\nand where women had much more power and influence,\n\nreally was not having a great time up north in Paris,\n\nwhere people were much more serious.\n\nShe and the French king had two children,\n\nbut after a certain point,\n\nit was clear that this was not working\n\nand they got the Pope to annul their marriage.\n\nOnce she was free,\n\nEleanor wrote to the young Prince Henry,\n\nletting him know that she was available\n\nshould he be interested, and he was.\n\nShe marries Henry\n\nand had an additional eight to ten pregnancies.\n\nShe is the mother of the famous Richard the Lionheart\n\nand the infamous King John.\n\nShe was busy up until the very end of her life.\n\nShe died when she was about 80 years old.\n\n@coveredinliz asks, what did the Holy Grail even do?\n\nJust a pretty cup?\n\nIt is such an important religious object.\n\nEither the cup that Christ drank from at the Last Supper\n\nand/or the cup that Joseph of Arimathea used\n\nto catch Christ's blood when he was on the cross.\n\nWhat's fascinating about the grail legend\n\nin the Arthurian stories\n\nis that no one ever really succeeds.\n\nIn fact, the only knight\n\nwho really has a true measure of success is Sir Galahad.\n\nHe gets to see the grail and when he does see it,\n\nwe are told in Sir Thomas Malory's Morte d'Arthur\n\nthat Galahad had sees something\n\nand we don't get to know what it is.\n\nHis flesh begins to tremble\n\nwhen he beholds these spiritual things\n\nand then he dies and gets taken up to heaven,\n\nwith the grail!\n\nFor everyone else,\n\nthe quest is pretty much a dismal failure.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nThanks very much for watching Medieval Support.\n\n[no audio]", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image":

{"title": "Walton Goggins Answers The Web's Most Searched Questions", "text": "Transcript\n\nSo sorry.\n\nIs this seat taken?\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nTable for one, right?\n\nHello, I'm Walton Goggins\n\nand this is the Wired Auto Complete Interview.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nOkay.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nWhere did Walton Goggins grow up?\n\nI grew up in a little bitty town called Lithia Springs,\n\nwhich is about 20 minutes outside of Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nIt's a beautiful little town.\n\nIt only had one stop sign\n\nand nobody else is from there but me.\n\nDoes Walton Goggins really have a southern accent?\n\nI do have a Southern accent, you know,\n\nbecause I'm from the south,\n\nso I speak like the other people speak that I grew up with.\n\nI can change it.\n\nI can't really do many accents.\n\nI mean, I can do Southern accent\n\nand I can just do one\n\nthat has just a slight southern accent to it.\n\nThat's about it.\n\nIt's the only range I have.\n\nWalton Goggins looks like Jim Morrison.\n\nThank you.\n\nReally?\n\nJim Morrison if he had teeth this big, I'll take it.\n\nLast one.\n\nWalton Goggins photography.\n\nOh, I like taking photos.\n\nI like traveling and I like taking pictures of the people\n\nthat I meet along the way.\n\nSo photography for me is a really big deal.\n\nIt's the way I document my experiences.\n\nCheck this out.\n\nNext.\n\nThis guy, is he in the union?\n\nWhat is Walton Goggins best known for?\n\nWell, depends on who you ask, right?\n\nI like to think clogging, but most people would disagree.\n\nMaybe The Hateful Eight.\n\nMaybe The Shield, may be Justified,\n\nmaybe Vice Principals,\n\nmaybe The Righteous Gemstones.\n\nBut right now, it's for Fallout.\n\nOkay.\n\nWalton Goggins upcoming projects.\n\nFallout season two.\n\nOh, and I am currently doing the White Lotus season three.\n\nHow about that?\n\nUnbelievable.\n\nWe're filming it down in Thailand.\n\nWalton Goggins, Quentin Tarantino.\n\nOh, how about that?\n\nWhen I was a little kid, I never thought I would see this\n\nname next to this name.\n\nI worked with Quentin two times on Django Unchained\n\nand The Hateful Eight.\n\nAnd he is my favorite filmmaker.\n\nLiving or deceased.\n\nThank God he's still living, my favorite.\n\nOkay, Walton Goggins western movies.\n\nI've been in a few of those.\n\nI love western movies.\n\nI love watching western movies.\n\nMy son was 11 years old when we really started\n\nintroducing him to a lot of different films.\n\nAnd the western genre was the first one\n\nthat we started with.\n\nLike The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,\n\nRio Bravo, Stagecoach, and all the rest of them.\n\nAnd he loves the westerns as much as I do.\n\nSergio Leone, I love you.\n\nOh, one fan fact.\n\nEnnio Morricone,\n\nyou know the great guy who won the Academy Award,\n\nwho did all of Leone's films?\n\nI got to record with him at Abbey Road in London.\n\nHow about that?\n\nCan Walton Goggins sing?\n\nYou know, the greatest compliment I've ever been given,\n\ntrue story, was Walton Goggins can sing\n\nwell enough to believe that he would never\n\nmake it as a singer.\n\nTrue story.\n\nCan Walton Goggins clog?\n\nYeah.\n\nIf this was a full shot, I would clog for you here,\n\nbut it's not.\n\nSo I can't.\n\nJust trust that these feet were made for clogging.\n\n'Cause my mother was a clogger\n\nand she got me into a clogging class.\n\nBelieve it or not.\n\nThat was a thing in Lithia Springs, Georgia, where I'm from.\n\nAnd she did it because my mom loves to dance\n\nand she wanted me to dance with her.\n\nSo I learned how to clog, but I also learned how to bop\n\nand bopping is the Florida version\n\nof the North Carolina shag.\n\nIt's super cool.\n\nYou know what else my mom taught me\n\nthat's not on this list?\n\nShe taught me how to two step\n\nand I'm a mean two stepper.\n\nWalton Goggins Misbehavin.\n\nYes, this is a song that I sang with Jennifer Nettles\n\nin season one of The Righteous Gemstones.\n\nThe thing that I had going for me was singing it\n\nwith Jennifer Nettles.\n\nThey boosted all of the lines that she sang\n\nand they brought all the lines that I sang down.\n\nYou know what?\n\nMaybe you know this lyric?\n\nRunning through the house with a pickle in my mouth.\n\nThank you.\n\nWow.\n\nGod, you should do this for a living.\n\nIt's extraordinary.\n\nIs Walton Goggins a bad guy in Fallout?\n\nOh, a great, great question.\n\nThe thing that I love about doing Fallout so much,\n\nit was architected in a way that the antagonist\n\nbecomes the protagonist\n\nthat may also become the antagonist again.\n\nAnd I would say that that applies\n\nto everybody that's in the show.\n\nIt takes a lot of energy to survive in the wasteland.\n\nAnd sometimes you gotta be a good guy\n\nand sometimes you gotta be a bad guy.\n\nIs Walton Goggins a nice guy?\n\n[beep], yes, I am.\n\nI'm the nicest guy.\n\nWhere's the next [beep] card, man?\n\nJust kidding.\n\nCan I cuss?\n\nI don't even know if I can cuss.\n\nOkay, is Walton Goggins...\n\nWow, this is a long piece of tape.\n\nThis is scaring me.\n\nComing back to Justified.\n\nI would absolutely love to come back to Justified.\n\nSo would Tim Olyphant,\n\nand I know FX would like to have Justified\n\nback on the air.\n\nIt's just a matter of timing.\n\nNext card.\n\n[beep], man.\n\nThank God you're not in the union.\n\nWhen does Walton Goggins\n\nappear in Righteous Gemstones?\n\nOh, okay, that's a very good question.\n\nEpisode three, season one.\n\nAnd I appear in The Righteous Gemstones\n\nin a bathtub for the very first time.\n\nAnd I stand up and I am naked in that bathtub.\n\nIt wasn't my actual body and it wasn't my anatomy.\n\nIt was a 78-year-old stand-in\n\nthat they flew in from Chicago.\n\nI got a call after the first...\n\nThat episode appeared,\n\nand a really good friend of mine said,\n\nmy God, your body looks so good, Walton.\n\nWhat?\n\nIt's not my body.\n\nThat's a 78-year-old stand-in.\n\nNext.\n\nWalton Goggins, Vice Principals.\n\nMm hmm.\n\nThat was literally one of the greatest\n\nexperiences of my life, honest to check.\n\nWalton Goggins on The Shield.\n\nLet's segue into a drama.\n\nAgain, another one of the greatest experiences of my life.\n\nWe filmed it in Los Angeles.\n\nMichael Chiklis and Kenny Johnson\n\nare still some of my best friends today.\n\nWe did The Shield over seven years.\n\nIt totaled 84 hours of television.\n\nThe Sopranos were on at the same time that we were.\n\nBut no one, no actor had been given the opportunity\n\nto play the same character in a serialized format\n\nfor 84 hours.\n\nWe had no idea that we were astronauts\n\nkind of in this world, if you will.\n\nAnd when we shot the pilot,\n\nno one had any idea that seven years later\n\nwe would be ending this story,\n\nhaving explored every aspect\n\nof their psychology, if you will.\n\nIt was and will remain\n\none of the greatest experiences of my life.\n\nNext.\n\nThank you.\n\nWalton Goggins.\n\nHey, I know him.\n\nWalton Goggins, Venus Van Dam.\n\nOh, now this is my girl, Venus Van Dam.\n\nKurt Sutter, the writer of Sons of Anarchy,\n\nwas one of the main writers on The Shield,\n\na very, very dear friend of mine.\n\nAnd the truth is, this is a true story.\n\nHe did an an interview where he said that\n\nthe only two people that I could never have on my show\n\nare Michael Chiklis and Walton Goggins,\n\nbecause no one could ever see them as anything\n\nbut their characters on The Shield.\n\nSomeone sent this article to me, I read it,\n\nI forwarded it to Kurt Sutter.\n\nAnd I said, you, [beep] you, man.\n\nI wouldn't do your show anyway.\n\nTrue story.\n\nI said, the only way that I would do your show\n\nis if I played a transgender.\n\nTwo years later, he sent me a text\n\nand he said, were you serious?\n\nAnd I said, about what?\n\nHe said, about playing a transgender.\n\nAnd I said, do you have pages?\n\nHe said, yes.\n\nHe sent them.\n\nI read them and it was one of the greatest things\n\nthat I had ever read.\n\nAnd it made me laugh and it broke my heart.\n\nAnd so I bought a pair of high heels\n\nwhile we were doing Django Unchained.\n\nAnd I walked the streets of New Orleans\n\nafter wrap at like midnight every night\n\nfor the better part of a month, just to get used to it.\n\nIf you can walk on high heels on cobblestone streets,\n\nyou could walk in them anywhere.\n\nI don't feel like I did that show\n\nbecause it took four and a half hours to get made up.\n\nI would come very early in the morning\n\nand no one outta respect for me\n\nand deference to Venus,\n\nno one ever saw that transition\n\nexcept the people that were working on it.\n\nCharlie and Kim and all the boys on the show\n\nonly ever met me as Venus Van Dam.\n\nWe had been friends for years before that,\n\nbut they never talked to me as Walton.\n\nThey only referred to me as Venus.\n\nAnd they treated me like the lady that I was.\n\nIt will remain one of the...\n\nAlso one of the greatest experiences of my life.\n\nWalton Goggins, White Lotus.\n\nLet me just say that again.\n\nWalton Goggins, White Lotus, season three,\n\nfilming it right now in Thailand.\n\nMike White has a unique way in which he observes the world.\n\nHe is able to articulate\n\nthrough dialogue an existential crisis of people\n\nthat is applicable to people from all walks of life,\n\nfrom all of these different character voices.\n\nAnd the thing about Mike White,\n\nwhich not a lot of people know outside of the business,\n\nis he writes all of it.\n\nHe does it all himself.\n\nOkay, Walton Goggins, Shanghai Noon.\n\nYeah, I did that.\n\nThere was a time in my life where I...\n\nI don't know if I manifested it,\n\nbut I just kind of concentrated on people\n\nthat I wanted to work with.\n\nAnd it started with Robert Duvall\n\nand I did The Apostle with Robert Duvall.\n\nAbout four months after I spent obsessing over\n\nthe fact that I wanted to work with Robert Duvall.\n\nOwen Wilson?\n\nI did the same thing.\n\nBottle Rocket was one of my favorite movies\n\nand remains this day to be one of my favorite movies.\n\nAnd Owen was the guy that I really wanted to work with.\n\nLo and behold, I got a call to come in\n\nand meet with Tom Dey, the director,\n\nand got the role of this movie with Owen\n\nand we became friends over the course of making it.\n\nAnd he is everything that I hoped he would be.\n\nIt was a great experience.\n\nWatch this.\n\nWell, that's it.\n\nWe're out of boards.\n\nI've never really thought about questions\n\nthat people ask when they Google my name,\n\nbut this has been illuminating in many, many ways.\n\nI

{"title": "Violinist Answers Violin Questions From Twitter", "text": "Transcript\n\nHi, I'm Andrew Bird.\n\nI'm a songwriter and composer.\n\nAnd I'm here today\n\nto answer your questions from the internet.\n\nWelcome to Violin Support.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nFirst question, latelordchatham.\n\nHave just had my violin lesson.\n\nI cannot get vibrato.\n\nI actually cannot.\n\nWhat is the secret?\n\nVibrato takes a long time.\n\nAs with every little technique, you kind of get it\n\nand then you're doing one little thing wrong\n\nand then it all kind of falls apart.\n\nVibrato is when you're...\n\n[violin playing]\n\nYou can see my last knuckle is kind of flexing a little bit\n\nand I'm moving the hand like this, not like this.\n\nAnd...\n\n[violin playing]\n\nBut just be patient.\n\nIt's just muscle memory.\n\nIt takes a long time.\n\nYou'll get it.\n\nOkay, this is from cowboiklaus.\n\nHow expensive are violins?\n\nLike I'm asking for a friend.\n\nViolins are quite expensive.\n\nBaffles me sometimes like a vintage guitar\n\nthat's super cool\n\nand sexy-looking is still somewhat affordable.\n\nTo get a violin that starts to be just playable\n\nand decent, not much under eight grand or 10 grand.\n\nThey just don't sound very good.\n\nI don't know why that is.\n\nIt's an art.\n\nIt's really tricky to shave down the wood thin enough.\n\nThere's a lot of nuance to making a good violin.\n\nThe market is very, it's very high.\n\nEmKenWheel.\n\nI've never understood how to hold a violin bow properly.\n\nAnother one that takes longer than almost anything\n\nto get with playing the violin,\n\nmore than figuring out where your fingers go\n\nis the bow technique 'cause it's a bit abstract.\n\nWhen I used to teach, I would tell my students\n\nto pretend that they're lying in a canoe\n\nand they've got their arm draped over the side in the water\n\nand they're dragging their arm through the water.\n\nYou got a very light touch on the bow.\n\nAny kind of like, death grip on the bow makes it not work.\n\nSo you got the bare minimum pressure on the bow,\n\nand your wrist is a hinge.\n\nAnd you're kind of leading this way\n\nand everything's trailing behind,\n\nlike dragging through the wind.\n\nThis one's from _Aware_Wolf.\n\nIs there a difference between a fiddle and a violin?\n\nOr is it that one of the players is classically trained\n\nand the other has a recipe for possum?\n\nWell, you don't need to get into stereotypes here.\n\nLet's just say it's basically function of it.\n\nViolin is listening music,\n\nand fiddle is functional, dance music.\n\nAnd the techniques,\n\ncreating your own backbeat, that's fiddle playing.\n\nIt tends to be a little rougher around the edges\n\nbecause the point of it\n\nis to drive social dance situations.\n\nSo social music versus like, listening music.\n\nViolin versus fiddle.\n\nBut otherwise,\n\nthere's no difference in the instrument itself.\n\nAnd this one is FishyIrfan.\n\nI should have attended a pre-concert explanation\n\nabout the difference between baroque violin\n\nand modern violin technique.\n\nThe main difference is there's little to no vibrato\n\nin baroque violin.\n\nAnd that means Mozart\n\nis really not supposed to be played vibrato\n\nif you want to be accurate\n\n'cause it sounds a little more like fiddle music in a way.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nAnd it's very resonant, and early music is very.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nLike, that's a sympathetic resonation of I'm playing\n\na D on the G-string.\n\nSo I have an open D next to it\n\nso it creates this extra resonance.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nWhereas I would play a C right below it,\n\nthere is no sympathetic sea stringing to that saw.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nIt's a little more dry-sounding.\n\nSo it's like natural reverb,\n\nwhen you get that extra string vibrating next to it.\n\n'Cause the sound waves go off of the string\n\nand hit the string next to it,\n\nand if it's the same note,\n\nit'll start vibrating sympathetically.\n\nThis is from pateverman.\n\nI must know the secrets\n\nof how to make the Stradivarius violet.\n\nWell a lot of people have been trying to figure that out.\n\nIt's a beautiful sound, but it's a very specific sound.\n\nIt's not always what you want.\n\nThe Stradivarius is an ancient instrument,\n\nand it is a more focused and goes into other senses.\n\nIt's like a, you know, succulent kind of sound.\n\nRich and dark, very dark.\n\nI mean first of all,\n\nthey were made in the 16 hundreds, generally, 17.\n\nIt was a family business,\n\nso it stretched over a period of time.\n\nSome say it's the particular wood that they sourced\n\nor the way they treated it or the way they've varnished it.\n\nScientists have taken this on as like a little project\n\n'cause they think, Oh there must be some quantifiable way\n\nto recreate the Stradivarius.\n\nAnd they've learned some interesting things,\n\nbut no one's really been able to quite pull it off.\n\nColin, it's 7619.\n\nThe violin doesn't work because there's no rosin.\n\nWTF is rosin.\n\nThe rosin is what makes the horse hair on the bow\n\ngrip a string and cause it to resonate.\n\nYou take this stuff, some sort of a resin,\n\njust go like that.\n\nComes off and you don't need much.\n\nIf you touch the bow with your hand,\n\nthe grease or oils from your hand will cause it to slick\n\nand it'll just go [shushing].\n\nIt'll just be like, it won't grip.\n\nThis one is from aileenyhaha.\n\nWould anyone please teach me how to use a loop pedal?\n\nCould be key for solo gigs.\n\nI've been using this loop pedal for years.\n\nIt's from the mid nineties.\n\nThe chip in it is apparently ancient.\n\nAnd it has a loop function where you get either 26 seconds\n\nto make a phrase\n\nthat once you click record again, it starts over that phrase\n\nand keeps recording so you can layer on top of that.\n\nThat's our loop.\n\nI usually start with pizzicato.\n\nIt's like playing the violin like a guitar.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nSo I'll start a phrase like this.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nSo I just sort of improvised\n\nsomething that's sort of

{"title": "Violinist Answers Violin Questions From Twitter", "text": "Transcript\n\nHi, I'm Andrew Bird.\n\nI'm a songwriter and composer.\n\nAnd I'm here today\n\nto answer your questions from the internet.\n\nWelcome to Violin Support.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nFirst question, latelordchatham.\n\nHave just had my violin lesson.\n\nI cannot get vibrato.\n\nI actually cannot.\n\nWhat is the secret?\n\nVibrato takes a long time.\n\nAs with every little technique, you kind of get it\n\nand then you're doing one little thing wrong\n\nand then it all kind of falls apart.\n\nVibrato is when you're...\n\n[violin playing]\n\nYou can see my last knuckle is kind of flexing a little bit\n\nand I'm moving the hand like this, not like this.\n\nAnd...\n\n[violin playing]\n\nBut just be patient.\n\nIt's just muscle memory.\n\nIt takes a long time.\n\nYou'll get it.\n\nOkay, this is from cowboiklaus.\n\nHow expensive are violins?\n\nLike I'm asking for a friend.\n\nViolins are quite expensive.\n\nBaffles me sometimes like a vintage guitar\n\nthat's super cool\n\nand sexy-looking is still somewhat affordable.\n\nTo get a violin that starts to be just playable\n\nand decent, not much under eight grand or 10 grand.\n\nThey just don't sound very good.\n\nI don't know why that is.\n\nIt's an art.\n\nIt's really tricky to shave down the wood thin enough.\n\nThere's a lot of nuance to making a good violin.\n\nThe market is very, it's very high.\n\nEmKenWheel.\n\nI've never understood how to hold a violin bow properly.\n\nAnother one that takes longer than almost anything\n\nto get with playing the violin,\n\nmore than figuring out where your fingers go\n\nis the bow technique 'cause it's a bit abstract.\n\nWhen I used to teach, I would tell my students\n\nto pretend that they're lying in a canoe\n\nand they've got their arm draped over the side in the water\n\nand they're dragging their arm through the water.\n\nYou got a very light touch on the bow.\n\nAny kind of like, death grip on the bow makes it not work.\n\nSo you got the bare minimum pressure on the bow,\n\nand your wrist is a hinge.\n\nAnd you're kind of leading this way\n\nand everything's trailing behind,\n\nlike dragging through the wind.\n\nThis one's from _Aware_Wolf.\n\nIs there a difference between a fiddle and a violin?\n\nOr is it that one of the players is classically trained\n\nand the other has a recipe for possum?\n\nWell, you don't need to get into stereotypes here.\n\nLet's just say it's basically function of it.\n\nViolin is listening music,\n\nand fiddle is functional, dance music.\n\nAnd the techniques,\n\ncreating your own backbeat, that's fiddle playing.\n\nIt tends to be a little rougher around the edges\n\nbecause the point of it\n\nis to drive social dance situations.\n\nSo social music versus like, listening music.\n\nViolin versus fiddle.\n\nBut otherwise,\n\nthere's no difference in the instrument itself.\n\nAnd this one is FishyIrfan.\n\nI should have attended a pre-concert explanation\n\nabout the difference between baroque violin\n\nand modern violin technique.\n\nThe main difference is there's little to no vibrato\n\nin baroque violin.\n\nAnd that means Mozart\n\nis really not supposed to be played vibrato\n\nif you want to be accurate\n\n'cause it sounds a little more like fiddle music in a way.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nAnd it's very resonant, and early music is very.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nLike, that's a sympathetic resonation of I'm playing\n\na D on the G-string.\n\nSo I have an open D next to it\n\nso it creates this extra resonance.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nWhereas I would play a C right below it,\n\nthere is no sympathetic sea stringing to that saw.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nIt's a little more dry-sounding.\n\nSo it's like natural reverb,\n\nwhen you get that extra string vibrating next to it.\n\n'Cause the sound waves go off of the string\n\nand hit the string next to it,\n\nand if it's the same note,\n\nit'll start vibrating sympathetically.\n\nThis is from pateverman.\n\nI must know the secrets\n\nof how to make the Stradivarius violet.\n\nWell a lot of people have been trying to figure that out.\n\nIt's a beautiful sound, but it's a very specific sound.\n\nIt's not always what you want.\n\nThe Stradivarius is an ancient instrument,\n\nand it is a more focused and goes into other senses.\n\nIt's like a, you know, succulent kind of sound.\n\nRich and dark, very dark.\n\nI mean first of all,\n\nthey were made in the 16 hundreds, generally, 17.\n\nIt was a family business,\n\nso it stretched over a period of time.\n\nSome say it's the particular wood that they sourced\n\nor the way they treated it or the way they've varnished it.\n\nScientists have taken this on as like a little project\n\n'cause they think, Oh there must be some quantifiable way\n\nto recreate the Stradivarius.\n\nAnd they've learned some interesting things,\n\nbut no one's really been able to quite pull it off.\n\nColin, it's 7619.\n\nThe violin doesn't work because there's no rosin.\n\nWTF is rosin.\n\nThe rosin is what makes the horse hair on the bow\n\ngrip a string and cause it to resonate.\n\nYou take this stuff, some sort of a resin,\n\njust go like that.\n\nComes off and you don't need much.\n\nIf you touch the bow with your hand,\n\nthe grease or oils from your hand will cause it to slick\n\nand it'll just go [shushing].\n\nIt'll just be like, it won't grip.\n\nThis one is from aileenyhaha.\n\nWould anyone please teach me how to use a loop pedal?\n\nCould be key for solo gigs.\n\nI've been using this loop pedal for years.\n\nIt's from the mid nineties.\n\nThe chip in it is apparently ancient.\n\nAnd it has a loop function where you get either 26 seconds\n\nto make a phrase\n\nthat once you click record again, it starts over that phrase\n\nand keeps recording so you can layer on top of that.\n\nThat's our loop.\n\nI usually start with pizzicato.\n\nIt's like playing the violin like a guitar.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nSo I'll start a phrase like this.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nSo I just sort of improvised\n\nsomething that's sort of polyrhythmic, has a groove to it.\n\nSo I've got my rhythmic skeleton here,\n\nand then I might improvise something on top of that.\n\n[violin playing]\n\nSo that just started out as like a novel way\n\nto expand this otherwise linear instrument\n\ninto like a cordal instrument, and just to try out ideas.\n\nSamSaltyScience.\n\nAnyone know how to properly tune a violin?\n\nGoogling and tuning

{"title": "Lando Norris & Oscar Piastri Answer Formula 1 Questions From Twitter", "text": "Transcript\n\nI'm Lando Norris.\n\nAnd I'm Oscar Piastri.\n\nAnd we're from Team McLaren.\n\nAnd today, we're gonna answer\n\nsome questions from the internet.\n\nThis is Formula 1 Support.\n\n[deep bass playing]\n\nYou got a little question from @theulteriorkid.\n\nIs it true that F1 drivers can tell\n\nwhat course it is from just hearing\n\nan audio recording of it?\n\nI've seen people do it before.\n\nI feel like I'm gonna be terrible at this.\n\n[cars revving]\n\nWell, this is coming down the pit lane.\n\nPit lane, Yeah.\n\nLong pit lane.\n\nOkay.\n\nThis is a very slow corner.\n\nI reckon it's Bahrain.\n\nYeah, a quick turn to,\n\nYou think Bahrain, huh?\n\nI think Bahrain.\n\n[Producer] You're right.\n\n[Lando] It is. There you go.\n\nIt's true.\n\nIt's possible.\n\nTheulteriorkid, it's true. Yeah.\n\nSo, that was just done via our knowledge\n\nof distance of pit exit.\n\nYeah.\n\nTo turn one.\n\nThe distance from the pit lane\n\nto the first corner is always different\n\ndepending on the track.\n\nIt sounded like we got up to like, I don't know,\n\nfifth gear or sixth gear and then we went down\n\na lot of gears, which means it's a slow corner.\n\nAnd then, the next corner seemed pretty quick.\n\nI thought it would be Bahrain.\n\nSo, there you go.\n\nFrom, @jswallow123.\n\nI wonder why F1 drivers have to get weighed after a race.\n\nDo you know why?\n\nSo, we have a minimum weight limit\n\nof 798 kilograms, including the car.\n\nThat's why we get weighed just to make sure\n\nthat we're not under the weight limit,\n\n'cause obviously that's an advantage.\n\nWe do lose weight 'cause we're sweating,\n\nwe're working hard.\n\nDoesn't always look it, but we are.\n\nSometimes you have a very hot race, you can lose a lot.\n\nYou can lose easily three, four kilograms.\n\nThe most weight I've ever lost is probably,\n\nyeah three, three and a bit kilos.\n\nAnd yeah, often we weigh ourselves\n\nbefore the session as well,\n\nbecause then the engineers have a good idea\n\nof what we're gonna weigh so that we're not underweight\n\nin the score flight.\n\nFrom Juaann_14, What do you think\n\nis the hardest track in F1?\n\nI think Monaco.\n\nProbably Monaco.\n\nMonaco or Singapore.\n\n[Lando] Easiest one to crash.\n\n[Oscar] Yeah.\n\n[Lando] Easiest one to make mistakes.\n\nYeah.\n\nMost demanding.\n\nYou just can't make a mistake.\n\nSimple as that.\n\nYou make one little mistake, you're on the wall.\n\nThat's game over. Game over.\n\nFrom @ashlikesracing.\n\nWhat's your favorite F1 rivalry?\n\nI think for me, probably Senna versus Prost,\n\nI think it's probably the most famous one.\n\nWe are rivals.\n\nWe are rivals, yeah.\n\nI wanna beat him and he wants to be me.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut, we have to pretend that we're besties.\n\nI think we both have the same goals.\n\nWe both wanna win.\n\nThe quickest way into achieving that\n\n[Oscar] is by working together, Yeah.\n\nhelping one another.\n\nJust helping the team score the most points possible.\n\nAs soon as you put their helmet on,\n\nyou kind of fight for yourself,\n\nbut you also fight for the team.\n\nYou just have to get that balance correct.\n\nPoints, you get 25 if you win.\n\nYou get 18 if you second,\n\n15 if you're third, 12 if you're fourth.\n\nAnd then, once you get to fifth it's 10,\n\nand then it keeps dropping by twos\n\nuntil you get to 10th, you get one point.\n\nAnd then anyone finishes from 11th to 20th,\n\nthey don't get any points.\n\nYou also get a fastest lap point if you get the fastest lap.\n\nSometimes you'll see us make a bit of an unexpected pit stop\n\nor push really hard for one lap.\n\nThat's 'cause we're trying to get\n\nan extra point for the fastest lap.\n\nAnd points mean prizes And points mean prizes.\n\n[Lando] More points you get, More prizes you get,\n\nthe more money you get.\n\n@nickscotney,\n\nHow critical is a front wing in today's F1?\n\nVery. Yes.\n\n[Oscar] It's huge. Yeah.\n\nIt's like as soon as you have a little bit of damage,\n\nYou know about it.\n\nOh, you know about it straightaway.\n\nThis is it.\n\nThis is the front wing.\n\nYep.\n\nBit of the front nose.\n\nYep. And the front wing.\n\nEverything on the car is pretty much aimed\n\nat trying to push the car into ground.\n\nThat's how you get more grip.\n\nThat's down force.\n\nThat just pushes the car down, pushes the tires down,\n\n[Oscar] gives you more grip. Yeah.\n\nBasically makes you go quicker.\n\nSo, this is crucial when you're steering.\n\n[Oscar] Yep.\n\nYou take this off, you'll turn into a corner,\n\nthere's no load, there's no grip on the front tires.\n\nYou'll just go straight on.\n\nJust as important as this is, the rear wing,\n\nwhich Oscar's pre-prepared,\n\nbasically does the same thing but at the back of the car.\n\n[Oscar] Yeah. Pitches the car down,\n\ngives you a lot more rear grip.\n\nIt'll be difficult to even complete a lap.\n\nYou would spin a lot and probably crash a lot.\n\nThese are like everything to us.\n\n[Oscar] Yeah.\n\nThese are magical.\n\nThe other thing is the car is designed\n\nto have a front wing on it so the rest of,\n\nif you take the front wing off,\n\nthe rest of the car doesn't really work either.\n\nBut, the air goes through the front wing first, obviously.\n\nAnd then, it goes like to the floor.\n\nIt goes to the rear wing.\n\nSo, if you lose the front wing or the air,\n\ndoesn't get directed where it needs to go.\n\nAnd then, you have even more problems\n\nthen just losing the front wing.\n\n@Nuttymedium asks, What's the driver's visibility like?\n\nPretty bad.\n\n[Oscar] You see your car. Yeah.\n\nThe first bit of like ground that you can see like,\n\nprobably 10 meters ahead.\n\nWhen you're driving, you're kind of just focusing\n\non what's ahead of you.\n\nEven like, you know we have the halo,\n\nprotects our head, but you don't really see it\n\nbecause similar to like your nose,\n\nyou're looking far enough ahead that it kind of,\n\nyour mind just blurs it out.\n\nBut because you're looking 20 meters ahead, 30 meters ahead,\n\nand you get your own sense of gears.\n\nLike we have the gear number on our screen.\n\nMaybe you do.\n\nI never look at it. I never look at it.\n\nLike, you just do it off of sound.\n\nYou do it off of memory, Yeah.\n\noff of feeling.\n\nWhen we pull up to the pit stop sometimes\n\nand we have people all around the car,\n\nyou don't wanna hurt anyone.\n\nBut you also wanna gain\n\nevery little bit of lab time possible.\n\nSo, you push it as much as you can.\n\nBut, we still make mistakes.\n\nWe misjudge it sometimes.\n\nSometimes you kind of lock up.\n\n[Oscar] Yeah.\n\nYou hit the guy but he's ready to kind of absorb\n\na bit of the impact.\n\nAnd then he jacks the car up to change the tires,\n\nput it back down and you go.\n\nThe first time you do it, you know you enter very slowly.\n\nAnd you kind of slowly start to learn\n\nhow much you can push it, and exactly how long\n\nand why the car is.\n\nBut, that's something that takes time.\n\nWe also have like a board\n\nthat we kind of line our tires up with.\n\nSo, we have like a good reference\n\nand we can't see much out of the car\n\nbut we can see a little bit sort of the top of the tires\n\nand a little bit above that.\n\nOtherwise, you probably see a lot more people getting hit.\n\nSo, our next question is from @B4wekiss.\n\nHow do drivers know that it's time for a pit stop?\n\nOur engineer just tells us.\n\nUltimately, we can decide if we don't want to or not.\n\nUsually, there's a pretty good reason\n\nwhy they would call us into the pit lane.\n\nYou kinda pit for two reasons.\n\nActually, you can have three reasons.\n\nOne, you've got damage.\n\nTwo, the tires are wearing out.\n\nThe tire's made of rubber.\n\nOver time that wears down.\n\nThe less rubber you have, the less grip you have.\n\nSo, at a certain point it's better\n\nto come into the pits, put new tires on.\n\nThey're always talking to us about\n\nhow our tires are going, whether we think we can keep going,\n\nand if it gets really bad,\n\nwhether we can keep the car on the track.\n\nSometimes you might just pit\n\nbecause the guy behind you is pit.\n\nUndercut is when someone pits before you,\n\nputs on fresh tires and then by the time that you pit,\n\nyou actually come out behind them.\n\nOvercut, which is actually the opposite of that.\n\nYou put on fresh tires but really the fresh tires\n\naren't that much better\n\nor maybe they're difficult to warm up.\n\nIt's actually better to go for a bit longer, pit later,\n\nand maybe you overtake someone that way.\n\nThat's when you get into the more technical stuff\n\nwith strategy, which is a big part of racing.\n\nSo, there's a lot of communication around\n\nthat side of things.\n\nSo, you kind of wanna be able to communicate\n\nwith your team without giving away too much information\n\nbecause all the other teams can listen\n\nto each other's radio.\n\nIt's why you never hear anyone say\n\nwhat lap they're gonna pit,\n\n'cause then you tell the whole pit lane\n\nwhat your strategy is.\n\nFrom AmberLoungeLtd.\n\nWhat's your favorite F1 car shape?\n\nWell, we grew up watching like 2010s, or late 2000s.\n\nSo, the old cars, like Lando's holding, look really cool.\n\nMuch more simple than what we have now.\n\n[Lando] The McLaren MP4 2B 1985 Prost car.\n\n[Oscar] Yeah.\n\nI think I've driven this one.\n\nI think I drove it in Sonoma.\n\nAll right.\n\nJust everything's cool about it.\n\nYeah. Everything.\n\nThe colors, the look.\n\nSounds incredible as well.\n\nFor me, sound is a big part of everything.\n\n[Oscar] Yeah.\n\nCars nowadays, sound terrible.\n\nThese sound way better.\n\nVery little technology.\n\nEverything here is to do with technology.\n\nHow they build it, how they design it.\n\n[Oscar] Yeah.\n\nMake it, it just drives differently.\n\nVery different.\n\nNo power steering.\n\nNow, we have power steering.\n\nSo, from step one to the end,\n\nbasically everything is changed\n\nor a lot more advanced nowadays.\n\nFrom @MaybellineGrace,\n\nDo all F1 drivers have a max speed of 241 miles an hour?\n\nFastest clocked has been 241 miles an hour.\n\nIt feels pretty quick going at that speed.\n\nIt depends on the car you're in,\n\ndepends on this track,\n\ndepends if you're in a slipstream as well.\n\nIf you've got a car in front of you,\n\nliterally punches a hole in the air for you\n\nso you have less drag and you can go faster.\n\nYou don't really realize how fast you're going\n\nuntil you see like, on your dash.\n\nWe'll just hit the throttle pedal as hard as we can.\n\nIt's not down to us, it's down to the car.\n\nIt depends a lot on the track as well.\n\nHow long the straight is.\n\nSo, when we race in Monaco for example,\n\nwe race with the most amount of down force on the car.\n\nSo, the top speed is very low.\n\nBut, when we go to somewhere like Monza,\n\nwe run the lowest amount of down force.\n\nWe go much faster on the straits.\n\nFrom T_angge,\n\nHi Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.\n\nI have a question for both of you.\n\nWhat are your rituals or warmups you do\n\nbefore going onto the race?\n\nI always do like a physical warmup before the race.\n\nSome skipping, some stretches.\n\nI lie on my bed.\n\nI have a little massage.\n\nI listen to some music.\n\nThe more chilled I can be, the better.\n\nOne other thing we do\n\na few days before the race is walk the track.\n\nTo see if there's anything new\n\nthat's changed from the year before,\n\nor if it's a new circuit or a track we haven't been to.\n\nJust looking at the curbs, what things to avoid,\n\nwhat places you definitely don't wanna over push.\n\nWhat places you can push.\n\nYou know, places you don't wanna make mistakes\n\nor you can't afford to make mistakes.\n\nDifferent things like that.\n\nWe talk a lot about the strategy before the race.\n\nSo we have some plans about\n\nwhat we might wanna do in the race.\n\nIf there's one pit stop or two or three, we'll have plans\n\nthat might have different amount of pit stops.\n\nNext question we got from @samuraisofree.\n\nHow does one train become an F1 driver\n\nso that they can also have cat-like reflexes?\n\nWe trained from a very early age,\n\nbut luckily, I got a pair of balls.\n\nLet's put it to the test.\n\nI wanna test you.\n\nThere's many different ways of doing things.\n\nHere's one of them.\n\nYeah.\n\nAre you ready?\n\nAs ready as I'll ever be.\n\nUh huh.\n\nThere you go.\n\nOh!\n\nThree.\n\n[laughter]\n\nOh, you got it.\n\nEvery driver does something different.\n\nI use these lights, which come on,\n\nyou have to react to the lights.\n\nYou can also get these glasses, which like flicker.\n\nOh yeah.\n\nThis also helps your reactions a little bit more.\n\nNext question is from @bybrandonwhite.\n\nDo F1 drivers accelerate or break on curves?\n\nSo, on the corners, what's the strategy with that?\n\nNormally, you break before the corner.\n\nIf you're coming from a really long straight\n\ninto a slow corner, you need to break a lot more\n\nthan if you're coming into a fast corner\n\nor you know you're coming out of a slow corner\n\nand then you've got another corner.\n\nThat's why you see it's lock up\n\nbecause we're trying to break as much as we can.\n\nThat's the strategy with that one.\n\nSo, those are all the questions for today.\n\nThank you very much for watching Formula 1 Support.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image": "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill,d_placeholder_wired.png,fl_progressive,g_face,h_1080,q_80,w_1920/v1717695609/wired_tech-support-lando-norris-and-oscar-piastri-answer-formula-1-questions-from-twitter.jpg", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.wired.com/video/watch/tech-support-lando-norris-and-oscar-piastri-answer-formula-1-questions-from-twitter", "timestamp": "1719366900.279357", "displayed": 0}

What it do?\n\nThis is Method Man right here.\n\nAnd this is the Wired Autocomplete Interview.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nAll right.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nAll right.\n\nWhere did Method Man grow up?\n\nLong Island and Staten Island,\n\n'cause my moms, we moved to Staten Island\n\nfrom Brooklyn, actually.\n\nA place where you couldn't stay too long,\n\nkind of like a shelter, but not a shelter.\n\nThe lady that was one of the people that worked there,\n\nher and my mom got really tight\n\nand that's how we ended up in Staten Island.\n\nLong Island, I was born there,\n\nso always got a place in my heart\n\nfor Hempstead, Long Island as a whole, period.\n\nMethod Man, Da Rockwilder.\n\nThis record done by the person we named it after,\n\nI wanted to name it after him, show homage,\n\ncame up through the ranks with Eric Sherman, Redman,\n\nand those guys.\n\nRedman didn't like the record.\n\nIt wasn't that he didn't like the record,\n\nhe knew that Rockwilder could do way better,\n\n'cause like I said, they all came up through those ranks.\n\nSo he was a little bit harder on Rockwilder,\n\nbut it turned out to be a hit.\n\nRockwilder, microphone checker.\n\nMethod man Jay-Z tour.\n\nWell it was actually the Hard Knock Life Tour,\n\nyes, it was definitely Jay-Z's tour.\n\nShout out to Jay-Z, you're doing magnificent things, man,\n\nbig things for hip hop as well as our culture as a whole.\n\nWhen we were asked to go on that, we knew what it entailed,\n\nwe knew who the artists were.\n\nI mean DMX, Jay-Z, you know, those are heavyweights.\n\nSo myself and Redman being that we were already veterans\n\nin the game, we kind of fit right in.\n\nAnd plus, I'm pretty sure Jay knew what me and Redman\n\nwere capable of doing on stage,\n\nand it was a very successful tour.\n\nWe did 54 dates, all of 'em sold out, there was even,\n\nI mean, we was getting so much money\n\nwhen the thing happened in Columbine,\n\neverybody donated their paycheck,\n\nor rather their show money to that cause\n\nfor the kids that lost lives.\n\nWe probably would've did it anyway,\n\neven if we weren't getting money,\n\n'cause a sign of the times that's what it is.\n\nBut yeah, it was a pretty lucrative tour for everybody.\n\nMethod man, The Riddler, loved this record.\n\nActually the guitar riff is played by\n\nOld Dirty Brasstards' older brother.\n\nNot too many people know that, fun fact.\n\nwe did this in The RZA's basement before the flood.\n\nYou know, us Blerds, us black nerds,\n\nwe love our comic books.\n\nAnd when the opportunity presented itself, The Riddler.\n\nI knew off top that I wanted to do a bad guy song.\n\nThe riff that Old Dirty Brasstards' brother came up with\n\nwas perfect.\n\nAnd I believe The Riddler played\n\na major part in that album,\n\nthe whole soundtrack going 10 times platinum.\n\nI like to say that in my head,\n\nbut it was really Seal, Kiss from a Rose,\n\nand, U2, U2, U2 had a great record on there as well.\n\nYeah, The Riddler.\n\nBam.\n\nWhat's Happenin', Method Man.\n\nI don't know, chilling.\n\nActually that's a song that picked me.\n\nBusta had a record and he came to me and he was like,\n\nyou need this record, lord.\n\nAnd when Busta tell you you need a record,\n\nyou need a record.\n\nAnd it became the first single.\n\nSo yeah, What's Happenin'.\n\nWhat does tical mean?\n\nTical can mean a lot of things,\n\nbut right now it means the top is cold and lonely.\n\nWell, I mean it came from a word we used to use\n\nto describe trees, plants, flower.\n\nIt was a word made up by a friend\n\naround my way named Lounging Low.\n\nIt took on its own life,\n\nso yeah, tical means a lot of things,\n\nbut right now the top is cold and lonely.\n\nWhat the Blood Clot, Method Man.\n\nI was actually mad at the Clan when I wrote that record.\n\nI was on the airplane playing my radio at that right,\n\ntimes have changed, they would never let me do that now.\n\nBut I was playing my radio\n\nand I kept rewinding an Eric Sherman record called\n\nIt's All In The Mind,\n\nthat's what I wrote What The Blood Clot to.\n\nI remember 'cause we got into a big argument\n\nbefore we got on the plane and I was just mad at all of 'em.\n\nLike Wu-tang Clan ain't nothing to [beep] with,\n\n[beep] you guys.\n\nThe What, Method Man, Biggie.\n\nThis is crazy too, because I actually snuck\n\nto go do this record with Biggie,\n\nTracey Waples, salute to Traywap.\n\nShe came and scooped me up that night\n\nand like I said, I wasn't supposed to be doing any records\n\nwith anybody, I had my own album coming.\n\nWu-Tang had steam and we wanted to keep that in home,\n\nand the money as well.\n\nSo I went and did the Biggie record, Big was mad cool.\n\nContrary to what everybody believes,\n\nhe wrote his rhyme right there when I wrote mine.\n\nNobody was doing anything inside their head.\n\nAnd it was a fun time, man, The What, Method Man,\n\nBiggie, Brooklyn.\n\nAll right, I got me embellishing too much.\n\nIs Method Man in Power?\n\nYes, I'm in Power.\n\nI play Davis MacLean on Power, very savvy lawyer.\n\nAnybody that follows the Power universe\n\nknow that lawyers don't fare too well on this show.\n\nSo I think the fact that Davis is still alive\n\nfor this fourth and final season\n\nsays a lot about his character and a lot about me.\n\nIs Method Man in Trainwreck?\n\nYes, I'm in Trainwreck,\n\nhad a lot of fun with the old cat Norman,\n\nI forgot his last name, but he's been around forever.\n\nHe was actually in the scene with me, he was the older cat,\n\nthat used to talk about Babe Ruth all day.\n\nFirst time working with Judd Apatow, not my first time, no,\n\nas a matter of fact,\n\nit wasn't my first time working with him.\n\nI actually read for the movie he did with Adam Sandler\n\nthat RZA got.\n\nBut Judd said that it is his life's mission\n\nto have every Wu-Tang member in at least one of his films.\n\nSo he's got two down, he's got about seven more to go.\n\nTrainwreck, dope.\n\nShout out to Amy Schumer, hey muffin.\n\nIs Method Man a Jets fan?\n\nAbso-freaking-lutely.\n\nI'm a Long Island kid, I mean we grew up on Jets and Mets.\n\nNot too big on basketball, but Jets and Mets\n\nwere always synonymous with Long Island, Queens,\n\nyou know what I'm saying?\n\nNew York Sack Exchange, those guys,\n\nI mean even Richard Todd, you know what I mean?\n\nHe was my guy for a minute.\n\nWesley Walker, Freeman McNeil, the Big Tuna.\n\nWe had Keyshawn for a while, Rob Moore, who I grew up with,\n\nRob Moore was a wide receiver for the team.\n\nSo yeah, I've been a Jets fan for life.\n\nSalute.\n\nWhere did Method Man get his name?\n\nTook it from a [beep].\n\nNah, actually, it's a block name, like I said,\n\nwe had different terminology for trees\n\nand Method was one of the terms that we used\n\nto describe trees and I felt like the man.\n\nSo yeah, Method Man, just fit.\n\nIs Method Man in The Wire?\n\nYes, I am in The Wire,' but I am not wired\n\n'cause I'm no snitch.\n\nI actually played a character called\n\nMelvin Cheese Wagstaff, nephew of Prop Joe.\n\nCheese was a piece of work, I think Cheese was a survivor,\n\nbut anybody that watched the show\n\nwould think he's a piece of [beep].\n\nI won't give any spoilers away,\n\nbut he does something that's against code\n\nand he deserved everything that he got.\n\nIs Method Man going on tour?\n\nNo sir, Method Man is more focused on acting,\n\nthat is first position for me.\n\nSo unless the movie is about a tour,\n\nMethod Man will not be on tour anytime soon.\n\nBut we do actually have a residency in Vegas, Wu-Tang.\n\nIf you can catch it, come out, it's pretty fun.\n\nYou know, bring you and your old lady, no kids.\n\nMethod Man, best songs.\n\nI got one, one that I think is my best song\n\nand it's definitely All I Need, of course.\n\nGot me a Grammy.\n\nIt actually was Mary's first Grammy,\n\nshe's gotten plenty more after that as she should.\n\nThe fact that it was a song that I didn't even wanna put out\n\nand it did what it did,\n\njust shows how much I know about music.\n\n[Interviewer] Why didn't you wanna put it out?\n\nIn my eyes, it wasn't a traditional love song,\n\nbut it was still a love song, which wasn't in my idea,\n\nsomething that I wanted to put out at that point in time.\n\nLook, keep Googling, stop with whatever, man.\n\nI don't even entertain any of that [beep].\n\nY'all be good, stay outta trouble.\n\n[upbeat music]", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast']", "top_image":

it?\n\nI hate to break it to you,\n\nthat these things are really just glorified laxatives.\n\nSo what's happening is that\n\nyou're speeding up your digestive process\n\nbeyond what it should be normally.\n\nBut what you're flushing out is\n\nfood that you haven't finished digesting properly\n\nand absorbing their nutrients.\n\nSo you're creating a lot of diarrhea,\n\nand you're also dehydrating yourself.\n\nSo while you might feel like you have a very flat tummy,\n\nit's not because you're actually losing weight\n\nor removing toxins, it's simply because you've removed food\n\nto quickly from your body, and you're dehydrating yourself.\n\n@itssynecdoche is asking, why am I only just learning\n\nthat chiropractors are not real doctors?\n\nYeah.\n\nSo chiropractic is a $15 billion industry,\n\nand it was invented by a guy named Didi Palmer\n\nwho thought that ghosts were telling him to create it.\n\nThey believe that the joints and the nerves\n\nthat go through our body are the cause of every ailment\n\nthat we know of.\n\nUnfortunately, chiropractic is a full-on pseudoscience.\n\nThere are certain chiropractors\n\nthat maybe stay in the lane of more physical therapy,\n\nand there's a little bit of data to suggest that\n\nfor certain types of low back pain,\n\nchiropractic adjustment can offer temporary relief,\n\nbut it's not fixing a musculoskeletal problem,\n\nand it's definitely not doing\n\nthe other things that chiropractors claim to do.\n\nSo if you see the abbreviation DC\n\nafter someone's name on social media,\n\nthat means that they're a chiropractor,\n\nand they're not a medical or scientific expert.\n\n@pathogenflock, is it just me,\n\nor is belief in pseudoscience rising recently?\n\nThis is absolutely correct.\n\nWe have seen a dramatic rise in anti-science\n\nand pseudoscience beliefs,\n\nand this does trend with the prevalence of social media.\n\nAlso coincides with the recent Covid-19 pandemic\n\nand the increasing amount of politicization of vaccines.\n\nSo this past year,\n\nonly 93.1% of entering school age children\n\nreceived vaccinations for the MMR,\n\nthe measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.\n\nThis is a 2% drop compared to the previous school year,\n\nparticularly for a disease where you need\n\nat least 95% coverage to stop the spread of measles,\n\nthis is a very concerning trend.\n\n@gutznotguts wants to know\n\nhow the [bleep] did the vaccines cause autism myth\n\neven start?\n\nThis myth started in 1998\n\nbecause of a British gastroenterologist\n\nnamed Andrew Wakefield,\n\nwho has since lost his medical license\n\nand the ability to practice medicine.\n\nBut he published a paper in The Lancet,\n\nwhich is a very prestigious medical journal,\n\nand claimed that he had data to demonstrate\n\na link between the MMR vaccine,\n\nwhich is the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine\n\nand autism symptoms in children.\n\nThe problem was he falsified all of the data in that paper.\n\nMore than that, he used self-reports from parents\n\nwho were planning to sue the existing manufacturers\n\nof the MMR vaccine.\n\nOn top of that, he was trying to sell\n\nand market his own MMR vaccine,\n\nbut because it was published\n\nin such prestigious medical journal,\n\nit took the world by storm, it caused a lot of fear.\n\nEventually that paper was retracted,\n\nbut that retraction did not occur until 2010,\n\n12 years later.\n\nNow, in recent years, we're seeing measles rates\n\nabove what we have ever seen in the US,\n\nand it is really a cause for concern\n\nbecause the very first measles vaccine\n\nwas put on the market in 1963.\n\nSo we have over 60 years of data\n\nthat demonstrate that there is no relationship\n\nbetween vaccines and autism.\n\n@briney4trump, GMOs change our DNA every day\n\nand give people several diseases.\n\nWhy did we approve of this?\n\nThis is not true.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the papaya was being wiped out\n\nby a virus called the papaya ring spot virus.\n\nSo we created a GMO papaya\n\nthat can resist the papaya ring spot virus.\n\n90% of the papayas are GMO.\n\nAnd when you eat them, it is not changing your DNA.\n\nSo when you eat the papaya, you're eating all of its cells\n\nand all of those cells contain DNA.\n\nSo those DNA molecules are going to enter your stomach\n\nand it's gonna mix with an enzyme called pepsin.\n\nSo when the pepsin interacts with the DNA molecule,\n\nit blasted apart into all of these individual subunits,\n\nand therefore the DNA is no longer intact.\n\nIt's not gonna change your DNA,\n\nit's not gonna cause any harmful consequences.\n\n@JohnnyV45385760 wants to know,\n\nhow can you tell if a health influencer is legit\n\nor full of shit?\n\nSome of the red flags to look for are, number one,\n\nthey are trying to evoke very strong negative emotions.\n\nThings like fear, anxiety, or worry,\n\nparticularly as it relates to your health\n\nor the health of your children or your family.\n\nNumber two, they're making all or none statements.\n\nThey're saying that this thing is causing cancer,\n\nor this thing is going to fix some disorder.\n\nNumber three, if they're selling you something\n\nthat is related to the claims that they're making,\n\nwhether that is a supplement, or a diet plan,\n\nor a protocol, or a book.\n\nNumber four, if they have an obvious conflict of interest.\n\nAre they working for the company\n\nof the product that they're selling you?\n\nAnd last but not least, if they're speaking way outside\n\nof their area of expertise.\n\nIf someone is a neuroscientist\n\nthat specializes in optic nerve signaling,\n\nand they're pretending to be an expert\n\nin infectious disease immunology,\n\nthat's probably a red flag.\n\n@10000problems wants to know\n\nwhy does homeopathic medicine work\n\nso much better than real medicine?\n\nUnfortunately that is not the case.\n\nBut let me tell you a little bit about what homeopathy is,\n\n'cause it's often confused with\n\nother sorts of alternative remedies.\n\nHomeopathy is a pseudoscience that was created\n\nor invented in the 1700s by a German guy\n\nnamed Samuel Hahnemann.\n\nHe created this based on two beliefs.\n\nThe first is that like cures like,\n\nmeaning that if something causes a symptom,\n\nthat same substance can cure\n\nan ailment that creates that symptom.\n\nOnion causes watery eyes when you cut it.\n\nTherefore, homeopathic onion\n\nis going to cure things like allergies\n\nthat also cause watery eyes.\n\nBut that goes along with the second belief,\n\nor the law of infinite decimals.\n\nMeaning that the remedy becomes more potent\n\nthe more it is diluted.\n\nIf you find a label on a homeopathic remedy\n\nthat says 12C, C means 100, and 12 means that you've diluted\n\nthe substance 12 times a hundred fold over,\n\nwhich means you have one part in this many parts,\n\nwhich is also called one septillion.\n\nSo what that means is that\n\nthere's no actual active ingredient in that.\n\nThat is probably a good thing\n\nbecause there are many homeopathic remedies\n\nthat can be very dangerous\n\nif you would ingest them at normal dosage.\n\nFor example, teething tablets\n\nthat claim to have homeopathic belladonna,\n\nwhich is deadly nightshade,\n\nwere contaminated with measurable levels of belladonna,\n\nand hundreds of babies developed seizures,\n\nand at least 10 babies died.\n\nThis happened starting in 2010 and 2012,\n\nand there were several brands that were to blame.\n\nOne final danger of homeopathy is that\n\nmany people believe that they're taking something\n\nthat's beneficial, and beyond the fact that it is\n\nnothing more than a sugar pill,\n\nit often leads people to forego actual medical care,\n\nwhich is one of the biggest harms of all.\n\n@paul_metta555 asks,\n\nare cell phone towers detrimental to our health?\n\nWhy so many?\n\nWhy do they emit high pitch noises?\n\nAre they carcinogenic?\n\nWhy the spiking cancer rates since they arrived?\n\nCell phone towers look like this.\n\nYou have this primary node that's coming out from all sides,\n\nand you have these radio waves that are being emitted.\n\nYou also have these secondary nodes\n\nthat are a little bit smaller,\n\nbut all of these radio frequency waves\n\nare projected in every direction,\n\nbecause otherwise we wouldn't have cell reception.\n\nSo this myth kind of started because people heard the word\n\nradiofrequency radiation and got scared,\n\nbecause we know that there are certain types of radiation\n\nthat are linked to cancer.\n\nHere we have the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nThings on this end are very high energy,\n\nand this rainbow right here is our visible light spectrum.\n\nUltraviolet and above, these types of radiation\n\ncan potentially damage our cells in our body,\n\nand can lead to changes in our cells and mutations.\n\nBut when you get below the energy level of visible light\n\nand you get into infrared and microwaves, way down here,\n\nthose are your radio waves.\n\nSo this radio frequency radiation\n\nis one of the lowest energy types of radiation,\n\nand it's considered what we call non-ionizing,\n\nmeaning it cannot penetrate your body.\n\nSo even if those radio waves are all over our planet,\n\nbecause we have cell reception everywhere,\n\nthe amount of energy that they're exerting\n\nis not actually going to damage your body\n\nor cause you any potential harm.\n\n@JohnPetersonFW wants to know, I'd really like to know,\n\nfrom someone that actually knows\n\nif buying organic food for double the price\n\nis actually worth it/better for you.\n\nThe biggest misconception is that organic is pesticide free.\n\nHere we have organic blueberries.\n\nThey are grown using organic pesticides\n\nand organic pesticides are simply chemicals\n\nthat have not been synthetically altered\n\nfrom the original state in which they exist\n\nsomewhere in nature.\n\nIn contrast, these are conventional blueberries\n\nwho were grown using conventional pesticides.\n\nConventional pesticides are those that can be\n\nsynthetically altered in order to improve their specificity.\n\nA 2010 study in PLoS One was looking at\n\nsix different pesticides that are used to control aphids\n\non soybean plants.\n\nIt was found to not only control aphids,\n\nbut it also killed the natural predators of the aphids,\n\nthe insidious flower bug, and the Asian lady beetle,\n\nhaving a more broad negative ecological impact.\n\nAnother misconception about all produce\n\nis that they have all these residues of pesticides on them.\n\nWe're talking about parts per trillion, parts per billion.\n\nThese are minuscule levels.\n\nIf you're very concerned about it, absolutely.\n\nWash your produce in water.\n\nBut aside from that,\n\nyou don't need to be stressing about your produce.\n\n@ToyaRochelle wants to know,\n\nwhat do people think they're cleansing\n\nwhen they do juice and smoothie cleanses or detoxes?\n\nBut I hate to break it to you,\n\nif you have functioning organ systems,\n\nyou're already detoxing all day every day.\n\nSo when people say that they're doing a parasite cleanse\n\nor a cleanse and they're claiming that these stringy things\n\nin their poop is parasite parse,\n\nwhat they're actually seeing is mucus\n\nand sloughed off intestinal cells,\n\nwhich is not a good thing,\n\nit's actually harming your GI tract.\n\n@bigpapabriggs wants to know, on a scale from one to 10,\n\nhow scared should I be of Lyme disease?\n\nSo as someone who's actually studied Lyme disease\n\nfor several decades,\n\nLyme disease is actually not as easy to get as you think.\n\nNot only do you have to have the right species of tick\n\nactually bite you, but it has to feed on you\n\nfor at least 24 hours\n\nin order to have a chance to transmit the bacteria for you.\n\nYour likelihood or risk of getting Lyme disease\n\nis very, very low.\n\nScale of one to 10, I would give it about a two or a three.\n\nThere's only two species of ticks in the US\n\nthat can transmit Lyme disease.\n\nThere are some areas in the country\n\nthat you have higher risk,\n\nlike the Midwest and the Northeast,\n\nand this is because you have higher proportions of\n\nboth the ticks that live there\n\nand the bacteria in those ticks.\n\nIn other parts of the country, the risk is almost zero.\n\nThere are a lot of common myths about Lyme disease.\n\nThe first is that once you're infected,\n\nyou're always gonna be infected, and that is just not true.\n\nIt's a bacterial infection,\n\nand once you've taken antibiotics for standard course\n\nor very effective treatments,\n\nyou're going to eliminate the bacteria.\n\nBut unfortunately, since it was discovered in the 1980s,\n\nit has really been the target of a lot of misinformation.\n\nAnd that can be attributed partially to some of these tests\n\nthat are sold direct to consumer,\n\nthat claim to be able to diagnose you with Lyme disease.\n\nUnfortunately, these tests are not FDA approved,\n\nand are not accurate, but they tell people\n\nthat they have Lyme disease when in reality they do not.\n\nSo it creates the perception that Lyme disease\n\nis not only more widespread than it is,\n\nbut is much more prevalent and severe.\n\n@RetiredDent, I'm seeing more and more parents\n\ngiving their children non fluoridated toothpaste.\n\nWhat's up with that?\n\nWhy are people so afraid of fluoride?\n\nWell, fluoride is a naturally occurring substance\n\nthat can be found in minerals and soil,\n\nand in our environment.\n\nAnd it was determined many, many years ago that communities\n\nthat had naturally higher levels of fluoride in their water\n\nwe're less likely to develop cavities.\n\nSo we started fluoridating water\n\nand adding fluoride to toothpaste over 75 years ago,\n\nand that's really plummeted\n\nthe amount of dental caries or cavities.\n\nUnfortunately claims on social media\n\nthat are not based on reality,\n\ntell people that fluoride is a neurotoxin.\n\nWhat they don't mention is that the dosage\n\nat which you'd have to consume fluoride\n\nin order to have any toxic effect\n\nis well outside of the reality\n\nof anything you could possibly consume.\n\nFluoride in water is added at 0.7 milligrams per kilogram,\n\nwhich means that in order to hit the minimum threshold\n\nwhere you might have skeletal effects from fluoride,\n\nif you were a child weighing 22 pounds,\n\nyou'd have to drink 57 liters of water a day.\n\nSo it really is not a concern.\n\n@karinefrigon says,\n\neverybody should have a gluten-free diet, I'm just saying.\n\nThe reality is if you don't have a medical reason\n\nto avoid gluten, you don't need to avoid gluten.\n\nGluten is a structural protein\n\nthat's found in certain grains like wheat,\n\nbarley, rosin and others.\n\nAnd there are certain medical conditions\n\nthat you should avoid this particular protein.\n\nThis would be something like celiac disease,\n\nwhich is an autoimmune disorder.\n\nThere's been a lot of studies\n\nin whether or not avoiding gluten offers a benefit,\n\nand the big consensus is is that it doesn't.\n\nSometimes we hear claims that the gluten here is worse\n\nbecause we use all the processed chemicals\n\nand we use all the pesticides.\n\nAnd when you went to Europe,\n\nyou were able to eat all the bread you wanted\n\nand you didn't have those issues with the gluten.\n\nAnd unfortunately, the gluten quantity in wheats\n\nacross countries is essentially the same.\n\nOn top of that, we also use the same pesticides.\n\nGlyphosate is one that's often demonized\n\nbecause it's used to dry down wheat,\n\nbut it's also used in Europe.\n\nEurope imports millions of pounds of American wheat\n\nevery year to make the very breads that you're eating.\n\nI would suggest that maybe you're more relaxed\n\nwhile you're on vacation,\n\nand you're not gulping down your food\n\nin between bringing kids to activities and swallowing air,\n\nleading to the perceived feeling of bloat,\n\nwhich has nothing to do with the gluten,\n\nbut everything to do with the rushing\n\nand the stress that you have with your day-to-day life.\n\n@TealePB wants to know what makes a study,\n\nany study, reliable?\n\nSo when we talk about the scientific method,\n\nwe have what we call the hierarchy of evidence.\n\nAt the bottom, you have things that are generally based\n\non small sample sizes or opinions.\n\nFrom there, you're going into animal trials\n\nand in vitro data.\n\nSo these are your Petri dish studies, or your animal data\n\nthat are not automatically representative\n\nof what's happening in people.\n\nSay you wanna study a disease process in humans\n\nand you use an animal model\n\nthat that disease doesn't occur in,\n\nthat's not going to be an accurate\n\nor representative research model,\n\nbecause it's not going to give you data\n\nthat you can then generalize to people.\n\nOnce you get above that, you're moving into human studies.\n\nRandomized controlled trials, they're usually also blinded.\n\nThose are considered our gold standard,\n\nso with vaccine studies, this is very common.\n\nThere is a group of people that receive the placebo,\n\nwhich is usually salt water,\n\nand there are people that received the vaccine.\n\nNone of them know what they received,\n\nyou might report different symptoms than if you knew\n\nyou were getting the placebo.\n\nAt the very top, you have what we call meta-analyses\n\nand systematic reviews.\n\nThese are analyses where we take multiple studies\n\nand we pool them and analyze them together.\n\nThere are really high quality journals like JAMA,\n\nwhich is the Journal of the American Medical Association\n\nor PNAS, which is the Proceedings\n\nof the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nBut as a rule of thumb, if you're trying to find information\n\non a given topic, you wanna look for at the minimum,\n\nthat it is indeed peer reviewed,\n\nand that it is aligning with other topics\n\nor other papers that are in that field.\n\nIt is very, very unlikely that one study\n\nis going to displace the thousands of other studies\n\nwithin a given field or topic.\n\nWe call that cherry picking.\n\n@WishWellTherapy wants know,\n\nstudy after study has revealed that aspartame,\n\nsucralose, and saccharin lead to cancer\n\nand other disorders of the cells and organ.\n\nSaccharin was actually banned temporarily in the US,\n\nbecause there was thought to be a relationship\n\nbetween saccharin and bladder cancer.\n\nIt turns out that the studies they were using\n\nwere using a type of rat.\n\nThese rats had a genetic predisposition\n\nthat they developed these bladder crystals,\n\nand made them more likely to develop tumors.\n\nNot only were we using rats that were not an appropriate\n\nor realistic research model, these rats were being fed\n\nclose to 10% of their body weight per day in saccharin.\n\nAnd it was at that point that a proportion of the male rats\n\ndeveloped bladder cancers.\n\nFollow-up studies using rhesus macaques, mice,\n\nand looking at human data have demonstrated\n\nthat saccharin is not related to cancer in humans at all,\n\nand so the ban was lifted.\n\nBut ultimately that stigma related to saccharin\n\nhas actually transferred to other artificial sweeteners.\n\n@flyrodu asks, how do we know that supplements work?\n\nIs there any real research on all these supplements\n\nthat exist?\n\nE.G, athletic greens, et cetera?\n\nSo in the United States alone,\n\nthe dietary supplement industry\n\nis worth nearly $160 billion.\n\nUnlike FDA approved medications,\n\nsupplements do not have to prove that they are helping\n\nor offering a benefit.\n\nA lot of people may take powdered vitamin C\n\nand mix it into their water\n\nwhen they feel like they have a cold or a flu coming on.\n\nVitamin C supplementation doesn't reduce the duration\n\nof respiratory illnesses,\n\nit doesn't lessen the severity of them,\n\nit doesn't prevent them.\n\nThere's been a lot of studies, especially in recent years\n\nthat have been looking at\n\nthe benefits of vitamin D supplement.\n\nSo this one assessed the efficacy of vitamin D and zinc\n\nin combination to improve outcomes of Covid-19.\n\nAnd ultimately what these show is that\n\nvitamin D supplementation did not lessen disease severity,\n\ndid not reduce hospital stay,\n\ndid not reduce severity of symptoms,\n\nand did not improve mortality outcomes.\n\nAnd there was a study that actually found over 50%\n\nof immune boosting supplements\n\nwere lying about what was in the product.\n\nAnd worse, some were not\n\nmentioning things that were in them.\n\n@pennebykameron wants to know,\n\nis there scientific evidence of crystals\n\nbefore and after charging?\n\nMany people believe that crystals have energetic powers,\n\nthat the crystal, or the energy in the crystal\n\nis vibrating with your own personal energy.\n\nAnd unfortunately there have been no studies\n\nthat have suggested that this is a true relationship.\n\nIt is likely nothing more than the placebo effect.\n\nThe placebo effect can be very strong.\n\nThere is a body of data that suggests that in some instances\n\npeople can feel like they're recovering\n\nfrom things more quickly or that their symptoms\n\nor side effects are lower\n\nbecause they have that power of the placebo.\n\nSo we don't wanna discount the placebo effect,\n\nbut we certainly don't want it to replace\n\nactual science-based medicine.\n\n@Janani802 wants to know, can fasting help cancer patients?\n\nSo this claim is really pervasive,\n\nand as someone who works in cancer research\n\nis really harmful for a lot of reasons,\n\nand it kind of breaks my heart.\n\nThis claim originated from in vitro studies,\n\nor Petri dish studies where we are growing cancer cells.\n\nAnd what they found was depriving them of nutrients,\n\nor simulating fasting cause the cancer cells to die.\n\nBut what that fails to account for is that\n\nany cell deprived of nutrient is going to fail to grow.\n\nAnd what happening in a piece of plastic\n\nor a plastic dish like this,\n\nis not what is happening inside the complex being of a human\n\nwho has cancer.\n\nFasting can actually be harmful if you're battling cancer,\n\n'cause you're depriving yourself and your body\n\nof very essential nutrients and calories that you need\n\nfor your immune system to do its best work.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nAlways be skeptical when you encounter things\n\nthat may not be as they seem.\n\nThanks for

medical license\n\nand the ability to practice medicine.\n\nBut he published a paper in The Lancet,\n\nwhich is a very prestigious medical journal,\n\nand claimed that he had data to demonstrate\n\na link between the MMR vaccine,\n\nwhich is the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine\n\nand autism symptoms in children.\n\nThe problem was he falsified all of the data in that paper.\n\nMore than that, he used self-reports from parents\n\nwho were planning to sue the existing manufacturers\n\nof the MMR vaccine.\n\nOn top of that, he was trying to sell\n\nand market his own MMR vaccine,\n\nbut because it was published\n\nin such prestigious medical journal,\n\nit took the world by storm, it caused a lot of fear.\n\nEventually that paper was retracted,\n\nbut that retraction did not occur until 2010,\n\n12 years later.\n\nNow, in recent years, we're seeing measles rates\n\nabove what we have ever seen in the US,\n\nand it is really a cause for concern\n\nbecause the very first measles vaccine\n\nwas put on the market in 1963.\n\nSo we have over 60 years of data\n\nthat demonstrate that there is no relationship\n\nbetween vaccines and autism.\n\n@briney4trump, GMOs change our DNA every day\n\nand give people several diseases.\n\nWhy did we approve of this?\n\nThis is not true.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the papaya was being wiped out\n\nby a virus called the papaya ring spot virus.\n\nSo we created a GMO papaya\n\nthat can resist the papaya ring spot virus.\n\n90% of the papayas are GMO.\n\nAnd when you eat them, it is not changing your DNA.\n\nSo when you eat the papaya, you're eating all of its cells\n\nand all of those cells contain DNA.\n\nSo those DNA molecules are going to enter your stomach\n\nand it's gonna mix with an enzyme called pepsin.\n\nSo when the pepsin interacts with the DNA molecule,\n\nit blasted apart into all of these individual subunits,\n\nand therefore the DNA is no longer intact.\n\nIt's not gonna change your DNA,\n\nit's not gonna cause any harmful consequences.\n\n@JohnnyV45385760 wants to know,\n\nhow can you tell if a health influencer is legit\n\nor full of shit?\n\nSome of the red flags to look for are, number one,\n\nthey are trying to evoke very strong negative emotions.\n\nThings like fear, anxiety, or worry,\n\nparticularly as it relates to your health\n\nor the health of your children or your family.\n\nNumber two, they're making all or none statements.\n\nThey're saying that this thing is causing cancer,\n\nor this thing is going to fix some disorder.\n\nNumber three, if they're selling you something\n\nthat is related to the claims that they're making,\n\nwhether that is a supplement, or a diet plan,\n\nor a protocol, or a book.\n\nNumber four, if they have an obvious conflict of interest.\n\nAre they working for the company\n\nof the product that they're selling you?\n\nAnd last but not least, if they're speaking way outside\n\nof their area of expertise.\n\nIf someone is a neuroscientist\n\nthat specializes in optic nerve signaling,\n\nand they're pretending to be an expert\n\nin infectious disease immunology,\n\nthat's probably a red flag.\n\n@10000problems wants to know\n\nwhy does homeopathic medicine work\n\nso much better than real medicine?\n\nUnfortunately that is not the case.\n\nBut let me tell you a little bit about what homeopathy is,\n\n'cause it's often confused with\n\nother sorts of alternative remedies.\n\nHomeopathy is a pseudoscience that was created\n\nor invented in the 1700s by a German guy\n\nnamed Samuel Hahnemann.\n\nHe created this based on two beliefs.\n\nThe first is that like cures like,\n\nmeaning that if something causes a symptom,\n\nthat same substance can cure\n\nan ailment that creates that symptom.\n\nOnion causes watery eyes when you cut it.\n\nTherefore, homeopathic onion\n\nis going to cure things like allergies\n\nthat also cause watery eyes.\n\nBut that goes along with the second belief,\n\nor the law of infinite decimals.\n\nMeaning that the remedy becomes more potent\n\nthe more it is diluted.\n\nIf you find a label on a homeopathic remedy\n\nthat says 12C, C means 100, and 12 means that you've diluted\n\nthe substance 12 times a hundred fold over,\n\nwhich means you have one part in this many parts,\n\nwhich is also called one septillion.\n\nSo what that means is that\n\nthere's no actual active ingredient in that.\n\nThat is probably a good thing\n\nbecause there are many homeopathic remedies\n\nthat can be very dangerous\n\nif you would ingest them at normal dosage.\n\nFor example, teething tablets\n\nthat claim to have homeopathic belladonna,\n\nwhich is deadly nightshade,\n\nwere contaminated with measurable levels of belladonna,\n\nand hundreds of babies developed seizures,\n\nand at least 10 babies died.\n\nThis happened starting in 2010 and 2012,\n\nand there were several brands that were to blame.\n\nOne final danger of homeopathy is that\n\nmany people believe that they're taking something\n\nthat's beneficial, and beyond the fact that it is\n\nnothing more than a sugar pill,\n\nit often leads people to forego actual medical care,\n\nwhich is one of the biggest harms of all.\n\n@paul_metta555 asks,\n\nare cell phone towers detrimental to our health?\n\nWhy so many?\n\nWhy do they emit high pitch noises?\n\nAre they carcinogenic?\n\nWhy the spiking cancer rates since they arrived?\n\nCell phone towers look like this.\n\nYou have this primary node that's coming out from all sides,\n\nand you have these radio waves that are being emitted.\n\nYou also have these secondary nodes\n\nthat are a little bit smaller,\n\nbut all of these radio frequency waves\n\nare projected in every direction,\n\nbecause otherwise we wouldn't have cell reception.\n\nSo this myth kind of started because people heard the word\n\nradiofrequency radiation and got scared,\n\nbecause we know that there are certain types of radiation\n\nthat are linked to cancer.\n\nHere we have the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nThings on this end are very high energy,\n\nand this rainbow right here is our visible light spectrum.\n\nUltraviolet and above, these types of radiation\n\ncan potentially damage our cells in our body,\n\nand can lead to changes in our cells and mutations.\n\nBut when you get below the energy level of visible light\n\nand you get into infrared and microwaves, way down here,\n\nthose are your radio waves.\n\nSo this radio frequency radiation\n\nis one of the lowest energy types of radiation,\n\nand it's considered what we call non-ionizing,\n\nmeaning it cannot penetrate your body.\n\nSo even if those radio waves are all over our planet,\n\nbecause we have cell reception everywhere,\n\nthe amount of energy that they're exerting\n\nis not actually going to damage your body\n\nor cause you any potential harm.\n\n@JohnPetersonFW wants to know, I'd really like to know,\n\nfrom someone that actually knows\n\nif buying organic food for double the price\n\nis actually worth it/better for you.\n\nThe biggest misconception is that organic is pesticide free.\n\nHere we have organic blueberries.\n\nThey are grown using organic pesticides\n\nand organic pesticides are simply chemicals\n\nthat have not been synthetically altered\n\nfrom the original state in which they exist\n\nsomewhere in nature.\n\nIn contrast, these are conventional blueberries\n\nwho were grown using conventional pesticides.\n\nConventional pesticides are those that can be\n\nsynthetically altered in order to improve their specificity.\n\nA 2010 study in PLoS One was looking at\n\nsix different pesticides that are used to control aphids\n\non soybean plants.\n\nIt was found to not only control aphids,\n\nbut it also killed the natural predators of the aphids,\n\nthe insidious flower bug, and the Asian lady beetle,\n\nhaving a more broad negative ecological impact.\n\nAnother misconception about all produce\n\nis that they have all these residues of pesticides on them.\n\nWe're talking about parts per trillion, parts per billion.\n\nThese are minuscule levels.\n\nIf you're very concerned about it, absolutely.\n\nWash your produce in water.\n\nBut aside from that,\n\nyou don't need to be stressing about your produce.\n\n@ToyaRochelle wants to know,\n\nwhat do people think they're cleansing\n\nwhen they do juice and smoothie cleanses or detoxes?\n\nBut I hate to break it to you,\n\nif you have functioning organ systems,\n\nyou're already detoxing all day every day.\n\nSo when people say that they're doing a parasite cleanse\n\nor a cleanse and they're claiming that these stringy things\n\nin their poop is parasite parse,\n\nwhat they're actually seeing is mucus\n\nand sloughed off intestinal cells,\n\nwhich is not a good thing,\n\nit's actually harming your GI tract.\n\n@bigpapabriggs wants to know, on a scale from one to 10,\n\nhow scared should I be of Lyme disease?\n\nSo as someone who's actually studied Lyme disease\n\nfor several decades,\n\nLyme disease is actually not as easy to get as you think.\n\nNot only do you have to have the right species of tick\n\nactually bite you, but it has to feed on you\n\nfor at least 24 hours\n\nin order to have a chance to transmit the bacteria for you.\n\nYour likelihood or risk of getting Lyme disease\n\nis very, very low.\n\nScale of one to 10, I would give it about a two or a three.\n\nThere's only two species of ticks in the US\n\nthat can transmit Lyme disease.\n\nThere are some areas in the country\n\nthat you have higher risk,\n\nlike the Midwest and the Northeast,\n\nand this is because you have higher proportions of\n\nboth the ticks that live there\n\nand the bacteria in those ticks.\n\nIn other parts of the country, the risk is almost zero.\n\nThere are a lot of common myths about Lyme disease.\n\nThe first is that once you're infected,\n\nyou're always gonna be infected, and that is just not true.\n\nIt's a bacterial infection,\n\nand once you've taken antibiotics for standard course\n\nor very effective treatments,\n\nyou're going to eliminate the bacteria.\n\nBut unfortunately, since it was discovered in the 1980s,\n\nit has really been the target of a lot of misinformation.\n\nAnd that can be attributed partially to some of these tests\n\nthat are sold direct to consumer,\n\nthat claim to be able to diagnose you with Lyme disease.\n\nUnfortunately, these tests are not FDA approved,\n\nand are not accurate, but they tell people\n\nthat they have Lyme disease when in reality they do not.\n\nSo it creates the perception that Lyme disease\n\nis not only more widespread than it is,\n\nbut is much more prevalent and severe.\n\n@RetiredDent, I'm seeing more and more parents\n\ngiving their children non fluoridated toothpaste.\n\nWhat's up with that?\n\nWhy are people so afraid of fluoride?\n\nWell, fluoride is a naturally occurring substance\n\nthat can be found in minerals and soil,\n\nand in our environment.\n\nAnd it was determined many, many years ago that communities\n\nthat had naturally higher levels of fluoride in their water\n\nwe're less likely to develop cavities.\n\nSo we started fluoridating water\n\nand adding fluoride to toothpaste over 75 years ago,\n\nand that's really plummeted\n\nthe amount of dental caries or cavities.\n\nUnfortunately claims on social media\n\nthat are not based on reality,\n\ntell people that fluoride is a neurotoxin.\n\nWhat they don't mention is that the dosage\n\nat which you'd have to consume fluoride\n\nin order to have any toxic effect\n\nis well outside of the reality\n\nof anything you could possibly consume.\n\nFluoride in water is added at 0.7 milligrams per kilogram,\n\nwhich means that in order to hit the minimum threshold\n\nwhere you might have skeletal effects from fluoride,\n\nif you were a child weighing 22 pounds,\n\nyou'd have to drink 57 liters of water a day.\n\nSo it really is not a concern.\n\n@karinefrigon says,\n\neverybody should have a gluten-free diet, I'm just saying.\n\nThe reality is if you don't have a medical reason\n\nto avoid gluten, you don't need to avoid gluten.\n\nGluten is a structural protein\n\nthat's found in certain grains like wheat,\n\nbarley, rosin and others.\n\nAnd there are certain medical conditions\n\nthat you should avoid this particular protein.\n\nThis would be something like celiac disease,\n\nwhich is an autoimmune disorder.\n\nThere's been a lot of studies\n\nin whether or not avoiding gluten offers a benefit,\n\nand the big consensus is is that it doesn't.\n\nSometimes we hear claims that the gluten here is worse\n\nbecause we use all the processed chemicals\n\nand we use all the pesticides.\n\nAnd when you went to Europe,\n\nyou were able to eat all the bread you wanted\n\nand you didn't have those issues with the gluten.\n\nAnd unfortunately, the gluten quantity in wheats\n\nacross countries is essentially the same.\n\nOn top of that, we also use the same pesticides.\n\nGlyphosate is one that's often demonized\n\nbecause it's used to dry down wheat,\n\nbut it's also used in Europe.\n\nEurope imports millions of pounds of American wheat\n\nevery year to make the very breads that you're eating.\n\nI would suggest that maybe you're more relaxed\n\nwhile you're on vacation,\n\nand you're not gulping down your food\n\nin between bringing kids to activities and swallowing air,\n\nleading to the perceived feeling of bloat,\n\nwhich has nothing to do with the gluten,\n\nbut everything to do with the rushing\n\nand the stress that you have with your day-to-day life.\n\n@TealePB wants to know what makes a study,\n\nany study, reliable?\n\nSo when we talk about the scientific method,\n\nwe have what we call the hierarchy of evidence.\n\nAt the bottom, you have things that are generally based\n\non small sample sizes or opinions.\n\nFrom there, you're going into animal trials\n\nand in vitro data.\n\nSo these are your Petri dish studies, or your animal data\n\nthat are not automatically representative\n\nof what's happening in people.\n\nSay you wanna study a disease process in humans\n\nand you use an animal model\n\nthat that disease doesn't occur in,\n\nthat's not going to be an accurate\n\nor representative research model,\n\nbecause it's not going to give you data\n\nthat you can then generalize to people.\n\nOnce you get above that, you're moving into human studies.\n\nRandomized controlled trials, they're usually also blinded.\n\nThose are considered our gold standard,\n\nso with vaccine studies, this is very common.\n\nThere is a group of people that receive the placebo,\n\nwhich is usually salt water,\n\nand there are people that received the vaccine.\n\nNone of them know what they received,\n\nyou might report different symptoms than if you knew\n\nyou were getting the placebo.\n\nAt the very top, you have what we call meta-analyses\n\nand systematic reviews.\n\nThese are analyses where we take multiple studies\n\nand we pool them and analyze them together.\n\nThere are really high quality journals like JAMA,\n\nwhich is the Journal of the American Medical Association\n\nor PNAS, which is the Proceedings\n\nof the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nBut as a rule of thumb, if you're trying to find information\n\non a given topic, you wanna look for at the minimum,\n\nthat it is indeed peer reviewed,\n\nand that it is aligning with other topics\n\nor other papers that are in that field.\n\nIt is very, very unlikely that one study\n\nis going to displace the thousands of other studies\n\nwithin a given field or topic.\n\nWe call that cherry picking.\n\n@WishWellTherapy wants know,\n\nstudy after study has revealed that aspartame,\n\nsucralose, and saccharin lead to cancer\n\nand other disorders of the cells and organ.\n\nSaccharin was actually banned temporarily in the US,\n\nbecause there was thought to be a relationship\n\nbetween saccharin and bladder cancer.\n\nIt turns out that the studies they were using\n\nwere using a type of rat.\n\nThese rats had a genetic predisposition\n\nthat they developed these bladder crystals,\n\nand made them more likely to develop tumors.\n\nNot only were we using rats that were not an appropriate\n\nor realistic research model, these rats were being fed\n\nclose to 10% of their body weight per day in saccharin.\n\nAnd it was at that point that a proportion of the male rats\n\ndeveloped bladder cancers.\n\nFollow-up studies using rhesus macaques, mice,\n\nand looking at human data have demonstrated\n\nthat saccharin is not related to cancer in humans at all,\n\nand so the ban was lifted.\n\nBut ultimately that stigma related to saccharin\n\nhas actually transferred to other artificial sweeteners.\n\n@flyrodu asks, how do we know that supplements work?\n\nIs there any real research on all these supplements\n\nthat exist?\n\nE.G, athletic greens, et cetera?\n\nSo in the United States alone,\n\nthe dietary supplement industry\n\nis worth nearly $160 billion.\n\nUnlike FDA approved medications,\n\nsupplements do not have to prove that they are helping\n\nor offering a benefit.\n\nA lot of people may take powdered vitamin C\n\nand mix it into their water\n\nwhen they feel like they have a cold or a flu coming on.\n\nVitamin C supplementation doesn't reduce the duration\n\nof respiratory illnesses,\n\nit doesn't lessen the severity of them,\n\nit doesn't prevent them.\n\nThere's been a lot of studies, especially in recent years\n\nthat have been looking at\n\nthe benefits of vitamin D supplement.\n\nSo this one assessed the efficacy of vitamin D and zinc\n\nin combination to improve outcomes of Covid-19.\n\nAnd ultimately what these show is that\n\nvitamin D supplementation did not lessen disease severity,\n\ndid not reduce hospital stay,\n\ndid not reduce severity of symptoms,\n\nand did not improve mortality outcomes.\n\nAnd there was a study that actually found over 50%\n\nof immune boosting supplements\n\nwere lying about what was in the product.\n\nAnd worse, some were not\n\nmentioning things that were in them.\n\n@pennebykameron wants to know,\n\nis there scientific evidence of crystals\n\nbefore and after charging?\n\nMany people believe that crystals have energetic powers,\n\nthat the crystal, or the energy in the crystal\n\nis vibrating with your own personal energy.\n\nAnd unfortunately there have been no studies\n\nthat have suggested that this is a true relationship.\n\nIt is likely nothing more than the placebo effect.\n\nThe placebo effect can be very strong.\n\nThere is a body of data that suggests that in some instances\n\npeople can feel like they're recovering\n\nfrom things more quickly or that their symptoms\n\nor side effects are lower\n\nbecause they have that power of the placebo.\n\nSo we don't wanna discount the placebo effect,\n\nbut we certainly don't want it to replace\n\nactual science-based medicine.\n\n@Janani802 wants to know, can fasting help cancer patients?\n\nSo this claim is really pervasive,\n\nand as someone who works in cancer research\n\nis really harmful for a lot of reasons,\n\nand it kind of breaks my heart.\n\nThis claim originated from in vitro studies,\n\nor Petri dish studies where we are growing cancer cells.\n\nAnd what they found was depriving them of nutrients,\n\nor simulating fasting cause the cancer cells to die.\n\nBut what that fails to account for is that\n\nany cell deprived of nutrient is going to fail to grow.\n\nAnd what happening in a piece of plastic\n\nor a plastic dish like this,\n\nis not what is happening inside the complex being of a human\n\nwho has cancer.\n\nFasting can actually be harmful if you're battling cancer,\n\n'cause you're depriving yourself and your body\n\nof very essential nutrients and calories that you need\n\nfor your immune system to do its best work.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nAlways be skeptical when you encounter things\n\nthat may not be as they seem.\n\nThanks for

The team was founded in 2017 and one of its original members, Adrienne So, is still on staff as a senior editor. We also work with a small group of trusted freelance contributors who are experts in their field. You\u2019ll find an author bio that outlines each tester\u2019s expertise on any review we publish. Our mission is to provide the most authentic and engaging buying advice for every product our audience needs or wants, to pioneer product discovery for tech enthusiasts, and to serve as a trusted hub for fair and thoughtful product reviews.\n\nHow does WIRED select products to test and review?\n\nWe\u2019re looking to write about products our readers are interested in, which means everything from groundbreaking new tech to novel gadgets they\u2019ve seen all over social media, to products like bed-in-a-box mattresses where it\u2019s difficult for any individual consumer to do proper comparison shopping. Our audience is tech-savvy, so you\u2019ll see lots of coverage of mobile phones, laptops, gaming devices, and the like, but WIRED readers also like to live comfortably and healthfully, score great deals, and often enjoy outdoor recreation.\n\nWhy should I trust WIRED\u2019s product reviews?\n\nBecause we tell the truth and we do the work. WIRED\u2019s Reviews team tests every product and service we write about, even when we\u2019re picking the best Amazon Prime Day deals. Our product recommendations are made in service to readers and independently of revenue considerations. While we do get a small cut of most sales when readers click to buy recommended products discussed in our product reviews and buying guides, the content in those guides is created through a rigorous and independent editorial process and is subjected to the same high standards as everything else WIRED publishes. Content from our Reviews team is fact-checked by editors and goes through the same prepublication review process as any other WIRED story. When we make a mistake, we immediately correct it and append an editor\u2019s note for transparency as appropriate.\n\nDoes the WIRED Reviews team use generative AI?\n\nNo. We follow the same editorial standards as everything else published by WIRED. You can read our whole policy here, but the gist is that we do not publish stories with text generated by AI, except when AI-generated text is the point of the story.\n\nDo you purchase every product you test?\n\nNo, but we do not accept \u201cfree products\u201d from manufacturers or make any agreements that involve a promise of editorial coverage in exchange for sending us a product. We often accept delivery of review samples directly from PR agencies and brands, which we typically don't pay for. We return or donate these samples after testing. When we know a specific product is of interest to readers and a review sample is not available, WIRED will purchase the product and the writer will donate it after testing.\n\nHow does the WIRED Reviews team conduct testing for product reviews?\n\nHow we test each product depends on what it is. We thoroughly test anything we recommend to readers and try to explain our methodology in each article without bogging it down with excessive detail many readers don\u2019t care about. Our overall goal in all testing is to replicate the product\u2019s regular use as closely as we can\u2014this is why we review mattresses by sleeping on them in our homes rather than dropping a bowling ball on them in a lab where we conduct \u201cnap tests.\u201d Since our testing methodology is a popular question with both readers and brands, we\u2019ve compiled the basic protocols for some of our key coverage areas below.\n\nEbikes: WIRED reviews upward of 50 new ebikes a year by riding them on a variety of terrain for at least 40 miles over the course of at least two weeks. We test cargo bikes by hauling kids and groceries, we ride mountain and gravel bikes on trails, and we test commuter bikes while running errands on regular city streets (including up and down steep hills). In addition to our real-life testing, we evaluate specs like weight, tire size, battery life, motor power, and the sourcing of key components to make our guides to the Best Ebikes and Best Cheap Ebikes.\n\nElectric scooters: WIRED reviewers ride electric scooters for at least 30 miles, though often much longer, on varying terrain and under various power loads (such as laden with groceries or up and down steep hills). Our main tester, the author of our guide to the Best Electric Scooters, is Brooklyn-based Julian Chokkattu, who takes electric scooters on the same routes through Bushwick during his tests so he can evaluate how a scooter may deviate from the established baseline.\n\nFitness trackers: WIRED\u2019s lead tester wears fitness trackers for at least two weeks and evaluates them on fit, specifications, durability, battery life, whether she can see the display in natural daylight, and whether features perform as advertised\u2014for example, AI coaching, climbing software, or GPS tracking. She also evaluates companion smartphone apps based on ease of use and claimed features.\n\nMattresses: We sleep on any mattress we recommend for at least a week in our own homes, though we sometimes give up on a mattress after a few nights (we then tell readers to avoid it), and we will sometimes spend months long-term testing. Lead reviewer Martin Cizmar has established a level of real-life mattress testing that\u2019s unmatched among our competitors, who frequently do a \"nap test\" where they form an opinion after sitting around on a mattress in their office.\n\nOffice chairs: We sit on every chair we test for several weeks while working\u2014two weeks at the minimum, but often much longer than that. We also invite different friends and family members to try the chairs out so we can assess comfort levels for folks with different heights and body types.\n\nMobile phones: To compile our expansive library of smartphone reviews and guides, our testers use any smartphone they\u2019re reviewing for at least a week, but sometimes longer. We test each phone by loading in our own SIM cards and using the phone as we would any personal device for the duration of the testing period. To compare cameras, we take the same photos on a second, similarly priced phone at the same time and study the results. For phone cases, which we test for at least a few days each, we look for alignment between ports and holes, check all buttons for clickiness, judge how it feels in our pockets, and check for how much the case is raised over the screen and camera lenses. We don't do drop tests as we don\u2019t have enough free phones to replace all the broken ones.\n\nInternet routers: WIRED tests Wi-Fi and mesh routers for at least one week, though often longer, in a home setting. We test the stated features and introduce stress testing, such as cutting the power to see how routers cope with a sudden loss of power. Our lead tester, Simon Hill, also runs a bevy of technical tests, including network throughput testing, file transfers, coverage heatmaps, and speed tests\u2014all organized into a handy (and impressive) spreadsheet.\n\nAir Purifiers: WIRED reviews more than 50 new air purifiers a year, assessing them in various home environments from coast to coast for months at a time. We test air purifiers in both homes and 100-year-old apartments with cats, dogs, and gas stoves, and near highways and in urban areas. In addition to our real-world testing, we measure decibel levels, ease of use, and efficacy, and we evaluate cost, design, length of warranty, and most importantly, the rate of air exchange in a specific-size room, making our deep dives, reviews, and Best Air Purifier guide essential reading.\n\nSoundbars: WIRED\u2019s staffers, including Parker Hall and Ryan Waniata, evaluate soundbars using a wide variety of testing material, from custom-made Dolby Atmos demos to familiar movies like Guardians of the Galaxy, sitcoms like Seinfeld and Parks and Recreation, and everything in between. We test apps and features like auto-calibration, surround sound speakers, and multiroom audio integration in multiple settings wherever possible. For music testing, we stream carefully curated playlists and random radio stations at compressed and lossless resolutions over Bluetooth and Wi-Fi where available. We live with these products over multiple days at minimum to test their usability the same way we expect you to use them.\n\nHeadphones and earbuds: Headphones and earbuds come in a multitude of styles, sizes, and varieties and we test them in accordance. For all headphones we test, sound quality, comfort, and fit are of the utmost importance. For wireless headphones and earbuds, we pay special attention to key aspects like ease of pairing and setup, battery life, app connection and settings, and convenience features like speak-to-chat. When focusing on sound quality, we use curated playlists with familiar music (from Fleetwood Mac\u2019s \u201cThe Chain\u201d to The Weeknd\u2019s \u201cStarboy\u201d) in both compressed and lossless resolution where applicable. For spatial audio, we test music and videos in multiple formats, including Dolby Atmos.\n\nTelevisions: TVs are among the most important products in A/V, and we test them accordingly. We spend at least a week with each TV we test, using it day and night as our daily driver. We utilize carefully selected video and audio content (from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows on Blu-ray to Our Planet in Dolby Vision and Atmos on Netflix). Our testing material runs the gamut, including live broadcasts, streaming content, and physical media with high-end Ultra HD Blu-ray players. We use Spears & Munsil\u2019s latest Ultra HD Benchmark discs to lock in settings and evaluate multiple resolution and HDR formats, including Dolby Vision, HDR10, and HDR10+. We watch content in various light conditions and test usability features, from smart assistants to services like AirPlay 2 and Chromecast to paint a holistic picture.\n\nRunning gear: Our lead writer runs four to five times a week, around 20 to 25 miles per week, and evaluates the gear\u2019s overall performance with a mix of long runs, interval runs, and trail and road running.\n\nPizza ovens: To name the best pizza ovens, we test each oven in our backyard for a minimum of two weeks. While using the oven, our testers also use handheld infrared thermometers to take the temperature of the baking stone at various places to gauge how evenly they heat and cook. We test all ovens with homemade dough, store-bought dough, and frozen pizzas.\n\nLuggage and backpacks: WIRED tests luggage designed primarily for air travel by taking it on at least two flights. When reviewing backpacks, our testers wear them for at least two weeks. In addition to this regular use, we also evaluate design details, like whether they have straight or curved zippers, what gauge the zippers are, whether they're toothed or coiled, what the warranty is, whether the hardware is metal or plastic, or whether the fabric is sustainable. Our reviewers also do things like fill backpacks full of books and toss them around, and kick carry-on bags to see whether they get foot marks or are easy to clean.\n\nUmbrellas: Our testers use umbrellas several times, whenever it rains. We test them as a normal person would while checking for the main hallmarks of what makes a good umbrella, as listed in our buying guide. We also aim to get a good sense of how each umbrella handles gusts and heavy storms.\n\nWebcams: We use every webcam we test for several weeks as a daily driver, and our testers also try to compare the image quality with another similar model. Reviewers make audio recordings to see how the mics pick up their voices. Webcam testers often solicit feedback on appearance and sound quality during our weekly Gear team meetings, which take place over Zoom.\n\nBidets: For our guide to the Best Bidets, our testers install the bidets on a toilet in their homes and use each sample for at least a week.\n\nMonitors: Reviewer Nena Farrell leads our coverage of the best computer monitors and tests each pick for at least one week, with a minimum of three working days. She sets monitors up with both a PC and Mac laptop to check performance, and she runs at least two different video games to see how the monitor performs, even if it isn't a monitor designed specifically for video games.\n\nCamp cookware: Reviewer Scott Gilbertson famously lives in an RV, so he is always testing camp cookware. In fact, grills and other cookware are tested for months before they ever make it into a guide. He cooks outside every day, rotating stoves every few months so he gets a good sense of how they perform, how they stand up to weather, and how hard they are to clean.\n\nTents: We aim to spend at least a week in every tent, ideally in a variety of weather conditions. Every pocket, zipper, guy line, and feature is tested. Will the rainfly catch on the door zippers? Is the ventilation good? Is the tent easy to set up? We assess all of the above and more, and list our favorites in our Best Tents buying guide.\n\nMeal kits: When testing meal kit delivery services, each service is evaluated meal-by-meal over the course of a few days. Our lead reviewer follows recipes to the letter and substitutes ingredients only if something arrives inedible\u2014for example, if something thaws during shipment or the produce is moldy (these substitutions are always noted). She always has at least one other person try a meal and notes down both of their first impressions and opinions before discussing the meal further. She assesses packaging, ingredient quality, texture, and taste, then factors in price to make recommendations.\n\nSecurity cameras: Indoor and outdoor security cameras are tested for at least one month. We test any manufacturer claims and special features, like motion detection or smartphone alerts, and stress-test the cameras as well. We also test videofeed quality and loading times.\n\nVideo doorbells: We test video doorbells for a minimum of two weeks. Any manufacturer claims are tested and verified, as are smartphone companion apps or smart home connectivity options. We also consider the data storage, retention, and privacy policies of the manufacturers of each camera we test, as these things also factor into our recommendations.\n\nSex toys and tech: We test sex tech for a minimum of two weeks using common sense. We test on different erogenous zones and different bodies. We also conduct controlled tests for features like battery life, waterproofness, and ease of cleaning. We test manufacturer claims as well.\n\nEspresso machines and coffee gear: We use espresso machines and coffee gear for at least two weeks in everyday situations. We also perform some controlled tests. Our lead reviewer tests for consistency, how hot the heating elements get, how quickly they heat up, how much time needs to pass between switching functions (brewing versus steaming), and the like. She also tests general usability. Is the machine easy to clean and maintain? Are things that need to be cleaned easily accessible? Does it look nice on the counter or does it seem to acquire a grime after only a couple uses? Does the steaming wand work efficiently? All of these factors inform our assessment.\n\nCoffee grinders: Our lead reviewer assesses coffee grinders for at least two weeks using a mix of everyday use and controlled tests. She\u2019s mostly testing for consistency, as well as factors like how quickly grime builds up in the burrs, how accessible the burrs are for cleaning, how loud the grinder is, and how finely or coarsely it can grind. She also assesses for ease of cleaning and overall maintenance requirements.\n\nDigital cameras: We test cameras by using them over a period of (ideally) months, but often just weeks because DSLR cameras, compact system cameras, and mirrorless cameras are generally loaned to us on a short-term basis, and camera companies are eager to pass them on to the next reviewer. Our lead reviewer tries to shoot at least 500 images on every camera he tests. He then views and edits the resulting RAW and JPG files in Darktable.\n\nCoolers: We test coolers by putting a standard bag of cube ice inside it on a warm day (at least 75 degrees Fahrenheit), putting the cooler in the shade, and then timing how long it takes for the ice to melt. We also assess weight, portability, durability, and overall design.\n\nBinoculars: We test binoculars by going birding. And to baseball games. And stargazing. For months and months.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast', 'Angela Watercutter', 'Medea Giordano', 'Scott Gilbertson', 'Parker Hall']", "top_image": "https://www.wired.com/verso/static/wired/assets/favicon.ico", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.wired.com/about/faq/", "timestamp": "1719366906.718283", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "WIRED\u2019s \u2018On Background\u2019 Policy", "text": "Many powerful companies make a practice of obfuscating or dodging accountability when speaking to media outlets by providing information while insisting it not be attributed to anyone in particular, and sometimes not even to the company itself. For that reason, WIRED is joining the Verge, Quartz, and others in making its editorial standards clearer.\n\nAnyone talking to WIRED reporters in any official capacity does so on the record by default. This means that what you say or write can be quoted and attributed to you by name, not just as \u201ca company spokesperson.\u201d We typically allow anonymity only to sources who could face retaliation or be endangered by the information they provide, and when we do so we explain our reasons to readers. As Julia Angwin, editor in chief of the Markup, has noted, \u201cCorporate spokespeople who are paid to provide information simply don\u2019t meet the criteria for being granted anonymity.\u201d\n\nSometimes we may agree to have a conversation on background, meaning we can use the information you provide, but will not identify you by name. Conversations are on background only when we agree to it. If you send us a statement \u201con background\u201d without prior agreement, we may still treat it as on the record.\n\nYou must also get our agreement for each proposed condition of the conversation, such as requests to not quote a particular statement directly or to identify a source in a certain way. Please be clear about your exact requests every time you speak with WIRED. At our discretion we may also tell our readers why we\u2019re providing the information in this way.\n\nOff-the-record conversations cannot be used for publication, and they also must be agreed to (which we rarely do for corporate spokespeople).\n\nThe companies you speak for play significant roles in shaping the future; we have a responsibility to tell our readers how we got the information about your plans to shape it.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast', 'Angela Watercutter', 'Medea Giordano', 'Scott Gilbertson', 'Parker Hall']", "top_image": "https://www.wired.com/verso/static/wired/assets/favicon.ico", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.wired.com/about/wired-on-background-policy/", "timestamp": "1719366907.5880861", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "15 Best Mattresses You Can Buy Online (2024)", "text": "You'll spend a third of your life on a mattress, which means picking the right one is important. Start with your preferred sleeping position and how much support you need. Here are a few tips.\n\nShould you buy a firm or soft mattress? Generally, heavier people and back or stomach sleepers will do better with firmer mattresses, while lighter people and side sleepers enjoy softer mattresses. Temperature is also an issue: Softer mattresses sleep warmer since your body is sinking into a layer of fabric and foam. Keep in mind that all mattresses have a break-in period, and the way the mattress feels on your first night won't be how it feels after a week or two.\n\nDo you want a hybrid or foam mattress? The next big question is whether you want a foam mattress or a hybrid model that layers foam with built-in springs. We tend to recommend hybrids because they are more stable and supportive, and they usually stay cooler. Hybrids are often slightly pricier. Foam mattresses tend to be softer, lighter, and cheaper.\n\nWhat size mattress do you need? The prices below are based on the queen size, but almost all mattresses come in the standard sizes of Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, and California King. You'll want to buy a mattress based on the size of your bed frame.\n\nHow easy is it to set up a bed-in-a-box? Most of these mattresses are delivered in a box, vacuum-sealed, and rolled up. Some are pretty heavy\u2014up to 150 pounds\u2014so be sure you have someone to help you. After you unroll your bed-in-a-box mattress and cut the vacuum bag open, it'll immediately begin to inflate, so unbox it on your bed frame or near it. We have a helpful guide on how to set up the mattress you bought online with more tips. The mattresses are usually ready to go in a few hours, but most manufacturers recommend giving them two days to reach their normal state.\n\nShould you wait for a sale to buy a mattress? Mattresses go on sale often. If you see one at full price, there's a strong chance you can save hundreds of dollars by waiting for the next big sale event (every few months).\n\nWhat if you don't like the mattress you bought online? Most of the mattresses we have tested and recommend have at least a 100-night testing period and a 10-year warranty. You may want to look at the company's policy as you may be on the hook for a nominal return fee.", "authors": "['Cond\u00e9 Nast', 'Martin Cizmar', 'Medea Giordano', 'Eric Ravenscraft', 'Scott Gilbertson', 'Louryn Strampe', 'Julian Chokkattu', 'Adrienne So', 'Nena Farrell']", "top_image": "https://media.wired.com/photos/664e22250b09b2ef41a851ac/191:100/w_2580,c_limit/Best-mattress-update-collage-052024-SOURCE-Martin-Cizmar.jpg", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-mattresses/", "timestamp": "1719366909.826838", "displayed": 0}
{"title": "The 16 Best Electric Bikes for Every Kind of Ride", "text": "For years, electric bicycles were bulky, inconvenient, expensive machines with limited battery life. Slowly, that has changed. Ebikes are now lighter, more attractive, and more powerful than ever. You don't need to be physically fit to ride one. They get you outside, reduce traffic congestion, and shrink your carbon footprint. I ride one daily to take my kids to school. They're just fun.\n\nOver the past few years, WIRED's Reviews team has tried almost every kind of electric bike, from the best heavy-duty cargo bikes to high-end mountain bikes. We review upward of 50 new ebikes a year by riding them on a variety of terrain for at least 40 miles over the course of at least two weeks. We test cargo bikes by hauling kids and groceries, we ride mountain and gravel bikes on trails, and we test commuter bikes while running errands on regular city streets (including up and down steep hills). In addition to our real-life testing, we evaluate specs like weight, tire size, battery life, motor power, and the sourcing of key components. If you don't see what you want, check back later (or drop me a note!). Once you buy an ebike, check out our Best Bike Accessories, Best Bike Locks, and the Best Ebikes for Elderly Riders. Not into pedaling? Read our Best Escooters guide for other transport options.\n\nUpdated June 2024: We added the Rad Power Radster Road, the Linus eDutchi, the Gazelle Eclipse, and the Aventon Ramblas.

Some reports indicate that Microsoft may also be entitled to some OpenAI payments.\n\n\u201cIt is true that we have ferocious competition with them,\u201d Suleyman said about OpenAI. \u201cThey are an independent company. We don\u2019t own or control them. We don\u2019t even have any board members. So they do entirely their own thing. But we have a deep partnership.

He was reportedly put on administrative leave following allegations of bullying employees, as Bloomberg reported in 2019, then moved to other Google roles before leaving the company in 2022 to join Greylock Partners as a venture partner. A few months later, he and Greylock\u2019s Reid Hoffman, a Microsoft board member, launched Inflection AI to build its own LLM chatbot, among other goals.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella tried but failed to hire Sam Altman last fall, when OpenAI fired him and then quickly reinstated him.

As one of OpenAI\u2019s previous big rivals, he\u2019s now getting to dive deep inside the crown-jewel frenemy competitor.\n\nThere\u2019s yet another wrinkle to all of this. OpenAI was founded with a premise of doing AI safety research, to stop a one-day evil AI from destroying humankind.

OpenAI\u2019s popular AI chatbot is available to all macOS users, the company announced on Tuesday. The app was first announced ahead of Apple\u2019s WWDC 2024 in June, where the companies jointly announced integrations between OpenAI\u2019s chatbot and Apple\u2019s operating systems for iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\nOn the latter platform, users can quickly call up ChatGPT by using the keyboard combination of Option + Space after installing the new ChatGPT app.\n\nThe ChatGPT desktop app for macOS is now available for all users.\n\n\n\nGet faster access to ChatGPT to chat about email, screenshots, and anything on your screen with the Option + Space shortcut: https://t.co/2rEx3PmMqg pic.twitter.com/x9sT8AnjDm \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) June 25, 2024\n\nThis makes access to the AI chatbot something that will immediately feel familiar to macOS users who regularly use other keyboard shortcuts like Command + Space to pop up a search bar to access Spotlight Search. But instead of more traditional search, they\u2019ll have access to a wider world of knowledge, only one button away. Once launched, ChatGPT appears as a chat interface overlaid on top of the screen.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s launch of the macOS app was a bit overshadowed at the time of the original announcement, as it arrived alongside GPT-4o, its flagship generative AI model that promises more advanced intelligence, including the ability to handle not only text and speech but also video. (Its multimodal capabilities and ability to understand media give the AI model its name; the \u201co\u201d stands for \u201comni.\u201d)\n\nChatGPT\u2019s desktop app was announced in the same press release, as a new app for both free and paid users. The company noted at the time that it could be called up with the simple keyboard shortcut and users could also take and discuss screenshots directly in the app. Users can upload files and other photos via the macOS app, too, as well as speak to ChatGPT from their desktop and search through their past conversations.\n\nThe app had been slowly rolling out to Mac users, starting with Plus subscribers, but today the company announced in a post on X that it\u2019s now available to everyone.\n\nThis isn\u2019t OpenAI\u2019s only integration with Apple devices. At WWDC, the companies announced a more expansive deal that will also see Apple customers gaining access to ChatGPT from their iPhones and iPads, including through Siri and within other areas that could be aided by AI, like Writing Tools. These integrations are also powered by GPT-4o and will roll out to Apple customers later this year with the launch of Apple\u2019s newest operating systems.", "authors": "['Sarah Perez']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/chatgpt-mac.jpg?resize=1200,672", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/chatgpt-for-mac-is-now-available-to-all/", "timestamp": "1719366945.945375", "displayed": 0}

The app was first announced ahead of Apple\u2019s WWDC 2024 in June, where the companies jointly announced integrations between OpenAI\u2019s chatbot and Apple\u2019s operating systems for iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\nOn the latter platform, users can quickly call up ChatGPT by using the keyboard combination of Option + Space after installing the new ChatGPT app.\n\nThe ChatGPT desktop app for macOS is now available for all users.\n\n\n\nGet faster access to ChatGPT to chat about email, screenshots, and anything on your screen with the Option + Space shortcut: https://t.co/2rEx3PmMqg pic.twitter.com/x9sT8AnjDm \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) June 25, 2024\n\nThis makes access to the AI chatbot something that will immediately feel familiar to macOS users who regularly use other keyboard shortcuts like Command + Space to pop up a search bar to access Spotlight Search. But instead of more traditional search, they\u2019ll have access to a wider world of knowledge, only one button away. Once launched, ChatGPT appears as a chat interface overlaid on top of the screen.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s launch of the macOS app was a bit overshadowed at the time of the original announcement, as it arrived alongside GPT-4o, its flagship generative AI model that promises more advanced intelligence, including the ability to handle not only text and speech but also video. (Its multimodal capabilities and ability to understand media give the AI model its name; the \u201co\u201d stands for \u201comni.\u201d)\n\nChatGPT\u2019s desktop app was announced in the same press release, as a new app for both free and paid users. The company noted at the time that it could be called up with the simple keyboard shortcut and users could also take and discuss screenshots directly in the app. Users can upload files and other photos via the macOS app, too, as well as speak to ChatGPT from their desktop and search through their past conversations.\n\nThe app had been slowly rolling out to Mac users, starting with Plus subscribers, but today the company announced in a post on X that it\u2019s now available to everyone.\n\nThis isn\u2019t OpenAI\u2019s only integration with Apple devices. At WWDC, the companies announced a more expansive deal that will also see Apple customers gaining access to ChatGPT from their iPhones and iPads, including through Siri and within other areas that could be aided by AI, like Writing Tools. These integrations are also powered by GPT-4o and will roll out to Apple customers later this year with the launch of Apple\u2019s newest operating systems.", "authors": "['Sarah Perez']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/chatgpt-mac.jpg?resize=1200,672", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/chatgpt-for-mac-is-now-available-to-all/", "timestamp": "1719366950.1004522", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "The RIAA\u2019s lawsuit against generative music startups will be the bloodbath AI needs", "text": "Like many AI companies, music generation startups Udio and Suno appear to have relied on unauthorized scrapes of copyrighted works in order to train their models. This is by their own and investors\u2019 admission, as well as according to new lawsuits filed against them by music companies. If these suits go before a jury, the trial could be both a damaging expos\u00e9 and a highly useful precedent for similarly sticky-fingered AI companies facing certain legal peril.\n\nThe lawsuits, filed by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), put us all in the uncomfortable position of rooting for the RIAA, which for decades has been the bogeyman of digital media. I myself have received nastygrams from them! The case is simply that clear.\n\nThe gist of the two lawsuits, which are extremely similar in content, is that Suno and Udio (strictly speaking, Uncharted Labs doing business as Udio) indiscriminately pillaged more or less the entire history of recorded music to form datasets, which they then used to train a music-generating AI.\n\nAnd here let us quickly note that these AIs don\u2019t \u201cgenerate\u201d so much as match the user\u2019s prompt to patterns from their training data and then attempt to complete that pattern. In a way, all these models do is perform covers or mashups of the songs they ingested.\n\nThat Suno and Udio did ingest said copyrighted data seems, for all intents and purposes (including legal ones), very likely. The companies\u2019 leadership and investors have been unwisely loose-lipped about the copyright challenges of the space.\n\nThey have admitted that the only way to create a good music generation model is to ingest a large amount of high-quality music. It is very simply a necessary step for creating machine learning models of this type.\n\nThen they said that they did so without the permission of music labels. Investor Antonio Rodriguez of Matrix Partners told Rolling Stone just a few months ago:\n\nHonestly, if we had deals with labels when this company got started, I probably wouldn\u2019t have invested in it. I think that they needed to make this product without the constraints.\n\nThe companies told the RIAA\u2019s lawyers that they believe the media it has ingested falls under fair-use doctrine \u2014 which fundamentally only comes into play in the unauthorized use of a work. Now, fair use is admittedly a complex and hazy concept in idea and execution, but the companies\u2019 use does appear to stray somewhat outside the intended safe harbor of, say, a seventh grader using a Pearl Jam song in the background of their video on global warming.\n\nTo be blunt, it looks like these companies\u2019 goose is cooked. They might have hoped that they could take a page from OpenAI\u2019s playbook, using evasive language and misdirection to stall their less deep-pocketed critics, like authors and journalists. (If by the time AI companies\u2019 skulduggery is revealed and they\u2019re the only option for distribution, it no longer matters.)\n\nBut it\u2019s harder to pull off when there\u2019s a smoking gun in your hand. And unfortunately for Udio and Suno, the RIAA says in its lawsuit that it has a few thousand smoking guns and that songs it owns are clearly being regurgitated by the music models. Its claim: that whether Jackson 5 or Maroon 5, the \u201cgenerated\u201d songs are lightly garbled versions of the originals \u2014 something that would be impossible if the original were not included in the training data.\n\nThe nature of LLMs \u2014 specifically, their tendency to hallucinate and lose the plot the more they write \u2014 precludes regurgitation of, for example, entire books. This has likely mooted a lawsuit by authors against OpenAI, since the latter can plausibly claim the snippets its model does quote were grabbed from reviews, first pages available online and so on. (The latest goalpost move is that they did use copyright works early on but have since stopped, which is funny because it\u2019s like saying you only juiced the orange once but have since stopped.)\n\nWhat you can\u2019t do is plausibly claim that your music generator only heard a few bars of \u201cGreat Balls of Fire\u201d and somehow managed to spit out the rest word for word and chord for chord. Any judge or jury would laugh in your face, and with luck a court artist will have their chance at illustrating that.\n\nThis is not only intuitively obvious but legally consequential as well, as the re-creation of entire works (garbled, but quite obviously based on the originals) opens up a new avenue for relief. If the RIAA can convince the judge that Udio and Suno are doing real and major harm to the business of the copyright holders and artists, it can ask the court to shut down the AI companies\u2019 whole operation at the outset of the trial with an injunction.\n\nOpening paragraphs of your book coming out of an LLM? That\u2019s an intellectual issue to be discussed at length. Dollar-store \u201cCall Me Maybe\u201d generated on demand? Shut it down. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right, but it\u2019s likely.\n\nThe predictable response from the companies has been that the system is not intended to replicate copyrighted works: a desperate, naked attempt to offload liability onto users under Section 230 safe harbor. That is, the same way Instagram isn\u2019t liable if you use a copyrighted song to back your Reel. Here, the argument seems unlikely to gain traction, partly because of the aforementioned admissions that the company itself ignored copyright to begin with.\n\nWhat will be the consequence of these lawsuits? As with all things AI, it\u2019s quite impossible to say ahead of time, since there is little in the way of precedent or applicable, settled doctrine.\n\nMy prediction is that the companies will be forced to expose their training data and methods, these things being of clear evidentiary interest. And if this evidence shows that they are indeed misusing copyrighted material, we\u2019ll see an attempt to settle or avoid trial, and/or a speedy judgment against Udio and Suno. It\u2019s likely that at least one of the two will attempt to continue onward, using legal (or at least legal-adjacent) sources of music, but the resulting model would (by their own standards for training data) almost certainly result in a huge step down in quality, and users would flee.\n\nInvestors? Ideally, they\u2019ll lose their shirts, having placed their bets on something that was in all likelihood illegal and certainly unethical, and not just in the eyes of nebbish author associations but according to the legal minds at the infamously and ruthlessly litigious RIAA.\n\nThe consequences may be far-reaching: If investors in a hot new generative media startup suddenly see a hundred million dollars vaporized due to the fundamental nature of generative media, suddenly a different level of diligence will seem appropriate.\n\nCompanies may learn from the trial or settlement documents what can be said \u2014 or perhaps more importantly, what should not be said \u2014 to avoid liability and keep copyright holders guessing.\n\nThough this particular suit seems almost a foregone conclusion, it will not be a playbook to prosecuting or squeezing settlements out of other generative AI companies but an object lesson in hubris.\n\nIt\u2019s good to have one of those every once in a while, even if the teacher happens to be the RIAA.", "authors": "['Devin Coldewey']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-1495170962.jpg?resize=1200,800", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/the-riaas-lawsuit-against-generative-music-startups-will-be-the-bloodbath-ai-needs/", "timestamp": "1719366958.799415", "displayed": 0}

Firefox notes that the offering is optional, so you don\u2019t have to pick one at all.\n\nThe launch of the new experience comes as companies like Google and Microsoft have added AI chatbots to their browsers.

The company plans to continue adding AI services.\n\n\u201cProviding choice in AI services is important for many reasons,\u201d Firefox senior vice president, Ian Carmichael, wrote in a blog post. \u201cFirst, you should be able to choose the service that works best for you, and not be locked into a single provider. Second, all of these models are still being developed and improved. None are perfect, and each has its own unique strengths and weaknesses. Offering options gives people an opportunity to experiment with many services to find the one that\u2019s most helpful in solving the problem they have.\u201d\n\nAfter choosing a preferred AI service, users will be able to ask the chatbot to summarize information on a webpage, simplify the language or test their knowledge on the information.\n\nThe idea behind the new offering is to allow users to try out a few different chatbots and pick the one they like the most. Firefox notes that the offering is optional, so you don\u2019t have to pick one at all.\n\nThe launch of the new experience comes as companies like Google and Microsoft have added AI chatbots to their browsers. Browser startups like Opera and DuckDuckGo have also added AI chatbots that can help users do things like summarize web pages and ask questions.", "authors": "['Aisha Malik']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1045357252.jpg?resize=1200,801", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/firefox-now-lets-you-choose-your-preferred-ai-chatbot-in-its-nightly-builds/", "timestamp": "1719366968.5888598", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "Etched is building an AI chip that only runs one type of model", "text": "As generative AI touches a growing number of industries, the companies producing chips to run the models are benefiting enormously. Nvidia, in particular, wields massive influence, commanding an estimated 70% to 95% of the market for AI chips. Cloud providers from Meta to Microsoft are spending billions of dollars on Nvidia GPUs, wary of falling behind in the generative AI race.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable, then, that generative AI vendors aren\u2019t pleased with the status quo. A large portion of their success hinges on the whims of the dominant chipmakers. And so they, along with opportunist VCs, are on the hunt for promising upstarts to challenge the AI chip incumbents.\n\nEtched is among the many, many alternative chip companies vying for a seat at the table \u2014 but it\u2019s also among the most intriguing. Only two years old, Etched was founded by a pair of Harvard dropouts, Gavin Uberti (ex-OctoML and ex-Xnor.ai) and Chris Zhu, who along with Robert Wachen and former Cypress Semiconductor CTO Mark Ross, sought to create a chip that could do one thing: run AI models.\n\nThat\u2019s not unusual. Plenty of startups and tech giants are developing chips that exclusively run AI models, also known as inferencing chips. Meta has MTIA, Amazon has Graviton and Inferentia, and so on. But Etched\u2019s chips are unique in that they only run a single type of model: Transformers.\n\nThe transformer, proposed by a team of Google researchers back in 2017, has become the dominant generative AI model architecture by far.\n\nTransformers underpin OpenAI\u2019s video-generating model Sora. They\u2019re at the heart of text-generating models like Anthropic\u2019s Claude and Google\u2019s Gemini. And they power art generators such as the newest version of Stable Diffusion.\n\n\u201cIn 2022, we made a bet that transformers would take over the world,\u201d Uberti, Etched\u2019s CEO, told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve hit a point in the evolution of AI where specialized chips that can perform better than general-purpose GPUs are inevitable \u2014 and the technical decision-makers of the world know this.\u201d\n\nEtched\u2019s chip, called Sohu, is an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) \u2014 a chip tailored for a particular application \u2014 made for running transformers. Manufactured using TSMC\u2019s 4nm process, Sohu can deliver dramatically better inferencing performance than GPUs and other general-purpose AI chips while drawing less energy, claims Uberti.\n\n\u201cSohu is an order of magnitude faster and cheaper than even Nvidia\u2019s next generation of Blackwell GB200 GPUs when running text, image and video transformers,\u201d Uberti said. \u201cOne Sohu server replaces 160 H100 GPUs. \u2026 Sohu will be a more affordable, efficient and environmentally friendly option for business leaders that need specialized chips.\u201d\n\nHow does Sohu achieve all this? In a few ways, but the most obvious (and intuitive) is a streamlined inferencing hardware-and-software pipeline. Because Sohu doesn\u2019t run non-transformer models, the Etched team could do away with hardware components not relevant to transformers and trim the software overhead traditionally used for deploying and running non-transformers.\n\nA graph from Etched comparing hardware performance running Meta\u2019s open model Llama 70B. Image Credits: Etched\n\nEtched is arriving on the scene at an inflection point in the race for generative AI infrastructure. Beyond cost concerns, the GPUs and other hardware components necessary to run models at scale today are dangerously power-hungry.\n\nGoldman Sachs predicts that AI is poised to drive a 160% increase in data center electricity demand by 2030, contributing to a significant uptick in greenhouse gas emissions. Researchers at UC Riverside, meanwhile, estimate that global AI usage could cause data centers to suck up 1.1 trillion to 1.7 trillion gallons of fresh water by 2027, impacting local resources. (Many data centers use water to cool servers.)\n\nUberti optimistically \u2014 or bombastically, depending on how you interpret it \u2014 pitches Sohu as the solution to the industry\u2019s consumption problem.\n\n\u201cIn short, our future customers won\u2019t be able to afford not to switch to Sohu,\u201d Uberti said. \u201cCompanies are willing to take a bet on Etched because speed and cost are existential to the AI products they are trying to build.\u201d\n\nBut can Etched, assuming it meets its goal of bringing Sohu to the mass market in the next few months, succeed when so many others are following close behind it?\n\nThe company lacks a direct competitor at present, but AI chip startup Perceive recently previewed a processor with hardware acceleration for transformers. Groq has also invested heavily in transformer-specific optimizations for its ASIC.\n\nCompetition aside, what if transformers one day fall out of favor? Uberti says, in that case, Etched will do the obvious: Design a new chip. Fair enough, but that\u2019s a pretty drastic fallback option, considering how long it\u2019s taken to bring Sohu to fruition.\n\nNone of these concerns have dissuaded investors from pouring an enormous amount of money into Etched, though.\n\nToday, Etched said it has closed a $120 million Series A funding round, co-led by Primary Venture Partners and Positive Sum Ventures. Bringing Etched\u2019s total raised to $125.36 million, the round saw participation from heavyweight angel backers including Peter Thiel (Uberti, Zhu and Wachen are Thiel Fellowship alums), GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke, Cruise (and the Bot Company) co-founder Kyle Vogt, and Quora co-founder Charlie Cheever.\n\nThese investors presumably believe Etched has a reasonable chance of successfully scaling up its business of selling servers. Perhaps it does \u2014 Uberti claims unnamed customers have reserved \u201ctens of millions of dollars\u201d in hardware so far.

{"title": "Etched is building an AI chip that only runs one type of model", "text": "As generative AI touches a growing number of industries, the companies producing chips to run the models are benefiting enormously. Nvidia, in particular, wields massive influence, commanding an estimated 70% to 95% of the market for AI chips. Cloud providers from Meta to Microsoft are spending billions of dollars on Nvidia GPUs, wary of falling behind in the generative AI race.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable, then, that generative AI vendors aren\u2019t pleased with the status quo. A large portion of their success hinges on the whims of the dominant chipmakers. And so they, along with opportunist VCs, are on the hunt for promising upstarts to challenge the AI chip incumbents.\n\nEtched is among the many, many alternative chip companies vying for a seat at the table \u2014 but it\u2019s also among the most intriguing. Only two years old, Etched was founded by a pair of Harvard dropouts, Gavin Uberti (ex-OctoML and ex-Xnor.ai) and Chris Zhu, who along with Robert Wachen and former Cypress Semiconductor CTO Mark Ross, sought to create a chip that could do one thing: run AI models.\n\nThat\u2019s not unusual. Plenty of startups and tech giants are developing chips that exclusively run AI models, also known as inferencing chips. Meta has MTIA, Amazon has Graviton and Inferentia, and so on. But Etched\u2019s chips are unique in that they only run a single type of model: Transformers.\n\nThe transformer, proposed by a team of Google researchers back in 2017, has become the dominant generative AI model architecture by far.\n\nTransformers underpin OpenAI\u2019s video-generating model Sora. They\u2019re at the heart of text-generating models like Anthropic\u2019s Claude and Google\u2019s Gemini. And they power art generators such as the newest version of Stable Diffusion.\n\n\u201cIn 2022, we made a bet that transformers would take over the world,\u201d Uberti, Etched\u2019s CEO, told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve hit a point in the evolution of AI where specialized chips that can perform better than general-purpose GPUs are inevitable \u2014 and the technical decision-makers of the world know this.\u201d\n\nEtched\u2019s chip, called Sohu, is an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) \u2014 a chip tailored for a particular application \u2014 made for running transformers. Manufactured using TSMC\u2019s 4nm process, Sohu can deliver dramatically better inferencing performance than GPUs and other general-purpose AI chips while drawing less energy, claims Uberti.\n\n\u201cSohu is an order of magnitude faster and cheaper than even Nvidia\u2019s next generation of Blackwell GB200 GPUs when running text, image and video transformers,\u201d Uberti said. \u201cOne Sohu server replaces 160 H100 GPUs. \u2026 Sohu will be a more affordable, efficient and environmentally friendly option for business leaders that need specialized chips.\u201d\n\nHow does Sohu achieve all this? In a few ways, but the most obvious (and intuitive) is a streamlined inferencing hardware-and-software pipeline. Because Sohu doesn\u2019t run non-transformer models, the Etched team could do away with hardware components not relevant to transformers and trim the software overhead traditionally used for deploying and running non-transformers.\n\nA graph from Etched comparing hardware performance running Meta\u2019s open model Llama 70B. Image Credits: Etched\n\nEtched is arriving on the scene at an inflection point in the race for generative AI infrastructure. Beyond cost concerns, the GPUs and other hardware components necessary to run models at scale today are dangerously power-hungry.\n\nGoldman Sachs predicts that AI is poised to drive a 160% increase in data center electricity demand by 2030, contributing to a significant uptick in greenhouse gas emissions. Researchers at UC Riverside, meanwhile, estimate that global AI usage could cause data centers to suck up 1.1 trillion to 1.7 trillion gallons of fresh water by 2027, impacting local resources. (Many data centers use water to cool servers.)\n\nUberti optimistically \u2014 or bombastically, depending on how you interpret it \u2014 pitches Sohu as the solution to the industry\u2019s consumption problem.\n\n\u201cIn short, our future customers won\u2019t be able to afford not to switch to Sohu,\u201d Uberti said. \u201cCompanies are willing to take a bet on Etched because speed and cost are existential to the AI products they are trying to build.\u201d\n\nBut can Etched, assuming it meets its goal of bringing Sohu to the mass market in the next few months, succeed when so many others are following close behind it?\n\nThe company lacks a direct competitor at present, but AI chip startup Perceive recently previewed a processor with hardware acceleration for transformers. Groq has also invested heavily in transformer-specific optimizations for its ASIC.\n\nCompetition aside, what if transformers one day fall out of favor? Uberti says, in that case, Etched will do the obvious: Design a new chip. Fair enough, but that\u2019s a pretty drastic fallback option, considering how long it\u2019s taken to bring Sohu to fruition.\n\nNone of these concerns have dissuaded investors from pouring an enormous amount of money into Etched, though.\n\nToday, Etched said it has closed a $120 million Series A funding round, co-led by Primary Venture Partners and Positive Sum Ventures. Bringing Etched\u2019s total raised to $125.36 million, the round saw participation from heavyweight angel backers including Peter Thiel (Uberti, Zhu and Wachen are Thiel Fellowship alums), GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke, Cruise (and the Bot Company) co-founder Kyle Vogt, and Quora co-founder Charlie Cheever.\n\nThese investors presumably believe Etched has a reasonable chance of successfully scaling up its business of selling servers. Perhaps it does \u2014 Uberti claims unnamed customers have reserved \u201ctens of millions of dollars\u201d in hardware so far. The forthcoming launch of the Sohu Developer Cloud, which will let customers preview Sohu via an online interactive playground, should drive additional sales, Uberti suggested.\n\nStill, it seems too early to tell whether this will be enough to propel Etched and its 35-person team into the future its co-founders are envisioning. The AI chip segment can be unforgiving in the best of times \u2014 see the high-profile near-failures of AI chip startups like Mythic and Graphcore, and the declining investment in AI chip ventures in 2023.\n\nUberti makes a strong sales pitch, though: \u201cVideo generation, audio-to-audio modalities, robotics, and other future AI use cases will only be possible with a faster chip like Sohu.

{"title": "TechWolf raises $43M to take an AI-sized bite out of the internal recruiting game", "text": "Layoffs continue to buffet the world of technology, but with the need for tech talent in organizations only growing, there\u2019s a bigger focus on how internal talent is managed.\n\nA startup from Ghent in Belgium called TechWolf is taking a unique approach to addressing that need. It has built an AI engine that ingests data from internal workflows to learn about the people doing that work. This is then turned into data for managers and internal recruiters to assess various employees\u2019 interests and skills more accurately, help connect them with different projects, and ultimately provide them with better training and more.\n\nThe company is making some waves with its technology, boasting an impressive list of customers that include GSK, HSBC, Booking.com and many others. And now it has raised nearly $43 million ($42.75 million, more precisely) in funding to expand its business.\n\nLondon-based Felix Capital is leading this Series B, while SAP, ServiceNow and Workday \u2014 three titans in HR \u2014 are co-investing alongside each other for the first time ever. Other backers include Acadian Ventures, Fortino Capital Partners, Notion Capital, SemperVirens and 20VC, along with unnamed \u201cAI leaders\u201d from DeepMind and Meta. From what we understand, the startup is now valued around $150 million.\n\nCEO Andreas De Neve, who co-founded TechWolf with Jeroen Van Hautte and Mika\u00ebl Wornoo, started the company in 2018 when the three were still computer science students at the University of Ghent in Belgium and Cambridge in England.\n\nThe original plan was to build an HR platform \u2014 with the startup building its own language model \u201clike ChatGPT,\u201d he said \u2014 to help source and hire talent from outside.\n\n\u201cIt failed,\u201d he said simply. Recruitment, or at least the part of it that they were trying to address, was just not that broken. Employers \u201cdidn\u2019t need AI to filter out the good applicants from the bad.\u201d\n\nBut the founders discovered that their target customers did have a different problem that needed fixing.\n\n\u201cThey said: \u2018Hey, so this AI model, is there any chance we could use it on our 40,000 employees instead of our applicants? Because there might be people who we could recruit internally,\u201d De Neve said. \u201cThe HR leaders pointed us toward the right problem to solve: identifying the skills of employees.\u201d\n\nThe question \u201cWhat is it you actually do?\u201d was a recurring joke about Chandler (an IT worker) on the TV show \u201cFriends.\u201d But it turns out to be a major issue in businesses in the real world, and it gets worse the bigger the organization becomes. \u201cYou can have 100,000 employees that are all super capable, who all spend a lot of time in software systems that create data,\u201d De Neve said. \u201cBut structurally, these companies know very little about these people. So that\u2019s what we set out to do.\u201d\n\nThat is just the kind of problem AI can solve, he said. \u201cWe started building language models that integrate with the systems people use for work: project trackers, documentation systems for developers, research repositories for researchers. And from all that data, we infer what skills those workers have. You can almost think of it as a set of AI models that connect with the digital exhaust of an organization.\u201d\n\nTechWolf touches on a few significant currents in the market right now that are worth noting:\n\nThe real innovators\u2019 dilemma? The seminal book \u201cThe Innovator\u2019s Dilemma\u201d paints a convincing picture of how even the most successful, large companies can be undone by smaller businesses that move more nimbly to respond to change. But looking at this a different way, the core asset that helps one organization work more flexibly than another is its people: How easily teams can be formed around different projects and goals arguably will be what makes or breaks those efforts. And it turns out that organizations are willing to pay good money for tech that can help them with that task.\n\nLLM vs. MLM vs. SLM. \u201cLarge\u201d language models and companies that are building them continue to generate a huge amount of interest. And \u201cgenerate\u201d is really the operative word here, since they are what underpin buzzy generative AI applications like ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, Claude, Suno and more. But there is definitely a rising tide for \u201csmaller\u201d language models that can be applied to very specific use cases, which are potentially less complex to build and operate, and ultimately more constrained and thus less prone to hallucination. TechWolf is not the only company working in this area, nor the only one to be catching the eye of investors. (Another example is the startup Poolside, which is building AI for a specific use case: developers and their coding tasks.)\n\nFocus indeed counts for a lot.

{"title": "TechWolf raises $43M to take an AI-sized bite out of the internal recruiting game", "text": "Layoffs continue to buffet the world of technology, but with the need for tech talent in organizations only growing, there\u2019s a bigger focus on how internal talent is managed.\n\nA startup from Ghent in Belgium called TechWolf is taking a unique approach to addressing that need. It has built an AI engine that ingests data from internal workflows to learn about the people doing that work. This is then turned into data for managers and internal recruiters to assess various employees\u2019 interests and skills more accurately, help connect them with different projects, and ultimately provide them with better training and more.\n\nThe company is making some waves with its technology, boasting an impressive list of customers that include GSK, HSBC, Booking.com and many others. And now it has raised nearly $43 million ($42.75 million, more precisely) in funding to expand its business.\n\nLondon-based Felix Capital is leading this Series B, while SAP, ServiceNow and Workday \u2014 three titans in HR \u2014 are co-investing alongside each other for the first time ever. Other backers include Acadian Ventures, Fortino Capital Partners, Notion Capital, SemperVirens and 20VC, along with unnamed \u201cAI leaders\u201d from DeepMind and Meta. From what we understand, the startup is now valued around $150 million.\n\nCEO Andreas De Neve, who co-founded TechWolf with Jeroen Van Hautte and Mika\u00ebl Wornoo, started the company in 2018 when the three were still computer science students at the University of Ghent in Belgium and Cambridge in England.\n\nThe original plan was to build an HR platform \u2014 with the startup building its own language model \u201clike ChatGPT,\u201d he said \u2014 to help source and hire talent from outside.\n\n\u201cIt failed,\u201d he said simply. Recruitment, or at least the part of it that they were trying to address, was just not that broken. Employers \u201cdidn\u2019t need AI to filter out the good applicants from the bad.\u201d\n\nBut the founders discovered that their target customers did have a different problem that needed fixing.\n\n\u201cThey said: \u2018Hey, so this AI model, is there any chance we could use it on our 40,000 employees instead of our applicants? Because there might be people who we could recruit internally,\u201d De Neve said. \u201cThe HR leaders pointed us toward the right problem to solve: identifying the skills of employees.\u201d\n\nThe question \u201cWhat is it you actually do?\u201d was a recurring joke about Chandler (an IT worker) on the TV show \u201cFriends.\u201d But it turns out to be a major issue in businesses in the real world, and it gets worse the bigger the organization becomes. \u201cYou can have 100,000 employees that are all super capable, who all spend a lot of time in software systems that create data,\u201d De Neve said. \u201cBut structurally, these companies know very little about these people. So that\u2019s what we set out to do.\u201d\n\nThat is just the kind of problem AI can solve, he said. \u201cWe started building language models that integrate with the systems people use for work: project trackers, documentation systems for developers, research repositories for researchers. And from all that data, we infer what skills those workers have. You can almost think of it as a set of AI models that connect with the digital exhaust of an organization.\u201d\n\nTechWolf touches on a few significant currents in the market right now that are worth noting:\n\nThe real innovators\u2019 dilemma? The seminal book \u201cThe Innovator\u2019s Dilemma\u201d paints a convincing picture of how even the most successful, large companies can be undone by smaller businesses that move more nimbly to respond to change. But looking at this a different way, the core asset that helps one organization work more flexibly than another is its people: How easily teams can be formed around different projects and goals arguably will be what makes or breaks those efforts. And it turns out that organizations are willing to pay good money for tech that can help them with that task.\n\nLLM vs. MLM vs. SLM. \u201cLarge\u201d language models and companies that are building them continue to generate a huge amount of interest. And \u201cgenerate\u201d is really the operative word here, since they are what underpin buzzy generative AI applications like ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, Claude, Suno and more. But there is definitely a rising tide for \u201csmaller\u201d language models that can be applied to very specific use cases, which are potentially less complex to build and operate, and ultimately more constrained and thus less prone to hallucination. TechWolf is not the only company working in this area, nor the only one to be catching the eye of investors. (Another example is the startup Poolside, which is building AI for a specific use case: developers and their coding tasks.)\n\nFocus indeed counts for a lot. I asked De Neve whether TechWolf had any ambitions to leverage the platform to expand into other areas like enterprise search or business intelligence. After all, it is already ingesting so much enterprise information, wouldn\u2019t it be one simple step further to build more products around that?\n\nNon, was De Neve\u2019s flat answer: \u201cWe can process data like nobody else in the market, but we are super, super focused on solving the skills problem, because there\u2019s too much demand for us already, right now, in the market where we operate.\u201d\n\nAt a time when it feels like there is a lot of noise in the world of AI, focus rings like a clear bell and could be one reason why investors are interested in companies like these.\n\nJulien Codorniou, the partner at Felix who led on this deal, believes TechWolf could outmaneuver even much bigger companies coming from other corners like AI-based enterprise search. \u201cDoing one thing well can really pay off,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be Workday or ServiceNow.

And, like the others before it, it\u2019s promising the moon.\n\nEmergence, whose co-founders include Satya Nitta, the former head of global AI solutions at IBM\u2019s research division, on Monday emerged from stealth with $97.2 million in funding from Learn Capital plus credit lines totaling more than $100 million. Emergence claims to be building an \u201cagent-based\u201d system that can perform many of the tasks typically handled by knowledge workers, in part by routing these tasks to first- and third-party generative AI models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o.\n\n\u201cAt Emergence, we are working on multiple aspects of the evolving field of generative AI agents,\u201d Nitta, Emergence\u2019s CEO, told TechCrunch. \u201cIn our R&D labs, we are advancing the science of agentic systems and tackling this from a \u2018first principles\u2019 perspective. This includes critical AI tasks such as planning and reasoning as well as self-improvement in agents.\u201d\n\nNitta says that the idea for Emergence came shortly after he co-founded Merlyn Mind, which builds education-oriented virtual assistants. He realized that some of the same technologies developed at Merlyn could be applied to automate workstation software and web apps.\n\nSo Nitta recruited fellow ex-IBMers Ravi Kokku and Sharad Sundararajan to launch Emergence, with the goal of \u201cadvancing the science and development of AI agents,\u201d in Nitta\u2019s words.\n\n\u201cCurrent generative AI models, while powerful in language understanding, still lag in advanced planning and reasoning capabilities necessary for more complex automation tasks which are the provenance of agents,\u201d Nitta said. \u201cThis is what Emergence specializes in.\u201d\n\nEmergence has a very aspirational roadmap that includes a project called Agent E, which seeks to automate tasks like filling out forms, searching for products across online marketplaces and navigating streaming services like Netflix. An early form of Agent E is already available, trained on a mix of synthetic and human-annotated data. But Emergence\u2019s first finished product is what Nitta describes as an \u201corchestrator\u201d agent.\n\nThis orchestrator, open sourced Monday, doesn\u2019t perform any tasks itself. Rather, it functions as a kind of automatic model switcher for workflow automations. Factoring in things like the capabilities of and the cost to use a model (if it\u2019s third party), the orchestrator considers the task to be performed \u2014 for example, writing an email \u2014 then chooses a model from a developer-curated list to complete that task.\n\nAn early version of Emergence\u2019s Agent E project. Image Credits: Emergence\n\n\u201cDevelopers can add appropriate guardrails, use multiple models for their workflows and applications, and seamlessly switch to the latest open source or generalist model on demand without having to worry about issues such as cost, prompt migration or availability,\u201d Nitta said.\n\nEmergence\u2019s orchestrator seems quite similar in concept to AI startup Martian\u2019s model router, which takes in a prompt intended for an AI model and automatically routes it to different models depending on things like uptime and features. Another startup, Credal, provides a more basic model-routing solution driven by hard-coded rules.\n\nNitta doesn\u2019t deny the similarities. But he not-so-subtly suggests that Emergence\u2019s model-routing tech is more reliable than others; he also notes that it offers additional configuration features like a manual model selector, API management and a cost overview dashboard.\n\n\u201cOur orchestrator agent is built with a deep understanding of scalability, robustness and availability that enterprise systems need and is backed by decades of experience that our team possesses in building some of the most scaled AI deployments in the world,\u201d he said.\n\nEmergence intends to monetize the orchestrator with a hosted, available-through-an-API premium version in the coming weeks. But that\u2019s only a slice of the company\u2019s grand plan to build a platform that, among other things, processes claims and documents, manages IT systems, and integrates with customer relationship management systems like Salesforce and Zendesk to triage customer inquiries.\n\nToward this end, Emergence says it\u2019s formed strategic partnerships with Samsung and touch display company Newline Interactive \u2014 both of which are existing Merlyn Mind customers, in what seems unlikely to be a coincidence \u2014 to integrate Emergence\u2019s tech into future products.\n\nAnother screenshot of Emergence\u2019s Agent E in action. Image Credits: Emergence\n\nWhich specific products and when can we expect to see them? Samsung\u2019s WAD interactive displays and Newline\u2019s Q and Q Pro series displays, Nitta said, but he didn\u2019t have an answer to the second question, implying that it\u2019s very early days.\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that AI agents are buzzy right now. Generative AI powerhouses OpenAI and Anthropic are developing task-performing agentic products, as are Big Tech companies, including Google and Amazon.\n\nBut it\u2019s not obvious where Emergence\u2019s differentiation lies, besides the sizable amount of cash out of the starting gate.\n\nTechCrunch recently covered another AI agent startup, Orby, with a similar sales pitch: AI agents trained to work across a range of desktop software. Adept, too, was developing tech along these lines, but despite raising more than $415 million reportedly now finds itself on the brink of a bailout from either Microsoft or Meta.\n\nEmergence is positioning itself as more R&D-heavy than most: the \u201cOpenAI of agents,\u201d if you will, with a research lab dedicated to investigating how agents might plan, reason and self-improve. And it\u2019s drawing from an impressive talent pool; many of its researchers and software engineers hail from Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and the Allen Institute for AI.\n\nNitta says that Emergence\u2019s guiding light will be prioritizing openly available work while building paid services on top of its research, a playbook borrowed from the software-as-a-service sector. Tens of thousands of people are already using early versions of Emergence\u2019s services, he claims.\n\n\u201cOur conviction is that our work becomes foundational to how multiple enterprise workflows get automated in the future,\u201d Nitta said.\n\nColor me skeptical, but I\u2019m not convinced that Emergence\u2019s 50-person team can outgun the rest of the players in the generative AI space \u2014 nor that it\u2019ll solve the overarching technical challenges plaguing generative AI, like hallucinations and the mammoth cost of developing models. Cognition Labs\u2019 Devin, one of the best-performing agents for building and deploying software, only manages to get around a 14% success rate on a benchmark test measuring the ability to resolve issues on GitHub. There\u2019s clearly a lot of work to be done to reach the point where agents can juggle complex processes without oversight.\n\nEmergence has the capital to try \u2014 for now.

A source familiar with the matter says that the deal is technically an acqui-hire and that most of Multi\u2019s team \u2014 around five people \u2014 will join OpenAI following the deal\u2019s close.\n\nAlexander Embiricos, Multi\u2019s CEO and one of its co-founders, says that Multi will shut down after July 24.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re beyond excited to share that Multi is joining OpenAI,\u201d he wrote in a post on Multi\u2019s blog. \u201cThank you to everybody who used Multi. It was a privilege building with you, and we learned a ton from you.\u201d\n\nWith Multi, Embiricos (an ex-Dropbox product manager) and Multi\u2019s second co-founder, Charley Ho (an ex-Google software engineer), set out to build a Zoom-based platform designed for remote teams to work together through video chats. Multi offered features like the ability to collaborate across screen shares from up to 10 people at the same time, customizable shortcuts and automatic deep links for code, designs and documents.\n\nExcited to share that Multi has been acquired by OpenAI!\n\n\n\nTo everyone who used Multi, submitted feedback and offered feature suggestions, Thank You. https://t.co/KU0AroW1tQ \u2014 Charley Ho (@potatoarecool) June 24, 2024\n\nAccording to Crunchbase data, Multi raised $13 million in cash from VCs including Greylock and First Round Capital prior to Monday\u2019s exit.\n\nAs with the Rockset buy, the Multi deal seems to fit into OpenAI\u2019s broader recent strategy of investing heavily in enterprise solutions. OpenAI recently revealed that the corporate tier of its viral AI-powered chatbot platform, ChatGPT, had close to 600,000 users, including 93% of all Fortune 500 firms.\n\nIn May, OpenAI signed an agreement with PwC to resell OpenAI\u2019s tools to other businesses.

{"title": "\u200b\u200bWhat Vinod Khosla says he\u2019s \u2018worried about the most\u2019", "text": "Vinod Khosla is more popular than ever right now. The Sun Microsystems co-founder turned prominent investor \u2014 first at Kleiner Perkins and, for the last 20 years, at his venture firm Khosla Ventures \u2014 has always been sought after by founders thanks to his no-nonsense advice and his firm\u2019s track record, including bets on Stripe, Square, Affirm, and DoorDash. But a $50 million gamble on OpenAI back in 2019 \u2014 when it was far from clear that the outfit would succeed on the scale that it has \u2014 put Khosla Ventures, and Khosla himself, squarely in the spotlight.\n\nHe\u2019s thoroughly enjoying himself. I sat down with Khosla this past week in Toronto at the Collision conference, and ahead of our stage appearance, he told me that he\u2019s been appearing in public \u2014 either onstage or on podcasts or television interviews \u2014 several times a week lately. Asked if he was exhausted by the schedule \u2014 for example, he flew into Toronto just hours before our sit-down \u2014 he shrugged off the suggestion.\n\nCertainly, there are things he prefers to talk about, and the art of deal-making is not among these things. \u201cFrankly, the investor side is much less interesting to me,\u201d he said when I asked him about something I heard recently, which is that he hasn\u2019t taken a dollar in management fees since starting Khosla Ventures, despite that it now has $18 billion in assets under management. (He confirmed this, but he said that\u2019s only true of himself and not a corporate-wide policy.)\n\nHe\u2019s much more passionate about the startup opportunities he spies in a landscape being changed daily by advances in AI, so we talked about some of this white space. We also talked about what concerns him the most about AI\u2019s ripple effects; FTC Chair Lina Khan; and why, in his view, the \u201cEuropeans have regulated themselves out of leading in any technology area.\u201d\n\nWe talked first about Apple\u2019s splashy new deal with OpenAI, which allows Apple to integrate ChatGPT into Siri and its generative AI tools. Apple may be striking similar deals with other AI models, including with Meta, but naturally, as an OpenAI investor, Khosla is bullish on the tie-up, which is the only one Apple has announced publicly so far.\n\nKhosla called it \u201cvalidation\u201d for OpenAI; by announcing its pact with OpenAI during its high-profile developers\u2019 conference, Apple was also \u201cexpressing confidence, I believe, in [OpenAI CEO] Sam [Altman] to lead [developments in AI] the next five or 10 years,\u201d said Khosla. \u201cWhen a company like Apple bets on a technology, they don\u2019t change it the next year usually.\u201d\n\nBut was it good news and also bad news for Khosla, I wondered? As we\u2019ve noted in TechCrunch, many startups will likely be disrupted right out of existence by some of Apple\u2019s newest features, and it seemed likely that Khosla\u2019s portfolio companies aren\u2019t entirely immune. I was especially curious about Rabbit, whose AI-powered hardware device promises to be a kind of AI assistant to users and is backed by Khosla Ventures.\n\nVinod Khosla onstage at Collision with TechCrunch editor-in-chief Connie Loizos. Image Credits: Vaughn Ridley / Collision\n\nAsked if the device could be made obsolete by Apple, Khosla suggested the device is more flexible than people imagine and could wind up being used by enterprises like hospitals, including in emergency room environments. He put it in the growing array of things that will \u201cwatch what you do, see what you do, and respond automatically.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Khosla suggested that his team has actively avoided anything that could become \u201croadkill\u201d as large language models like that of OpenAI progress further. And he highlighted at least one company that\u2019s not in his portfolio: Grammarly, a writing assistant startup that was valued by its backers not so long ago at $13 billion.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re doing Grammarly, say, it\u2019s really a light wrapper on today\u2019s model, and Grammarly won\u2019t keep up; it should never have been an app. It shows the need for that capability, but it will be part of Word or Google Docs. It\u2019s pretty obvious. When we talk to YC companies or others,\u201d Khosla continued, \u201cI can usually say, \u2018Half of these companies will be obsolete before the YC batch is over.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhere Khosla sees plenty of opportunities are in verticals where expertise will become near free, although it\u2019s not clear to me how these companies will sustainably make money (even after asking him). Think tutoring, or even oncology.\n\nSaid Khosla: \u201cOpen AI or Google isn\u2019t going to build a chip designer [to have on your smartphone]. OpenAI and Google aren\u2019t going to build a structural engineer. They\u2019re not going to build a primary care doctor or a mental health therapist,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there are so many areas for [founders to mine]. But they have to look at where the models are going next year and five years from now, and say, \u2018We want to leverage that capability.\u2019\u201d\n\nWe also talked about regulation. I observed that Khosla has said before that closed large language models like that of OpenAI should be safeguarded, even while there should be a regulatory framework around them. I wondered if that means that Khosla will forever forswear other, \u201copen source\u201d AI.\n\nNot at all, he said, noting that he\u2019s a \u201chuge fan\u201d of open source. Sun was one of the first companies to \u201cjump on open source,\u201d opening sourcing its file system, he said. He also noted that Khosla Ventures was the earliest investor in GitLab, whose software invites people to work on code jointly.\n\nBut he suggested that open source in the context of large language models is a different animal altogether. The \u201clargest risk we face with AI is China\u201d and \u201cpowerful Chinese AI\u201d that competes with the \u201cliberal values\u201d of the U.S., he said, adding that \u201cwe need to make sure that China stays behind us.\u201d Otherwise, he warned, it will be China providing the \u201cfree doctors and free oncologists\u201d to the rest of the world and, while they are at it, they\u2019ll \u201cexport both the economic power that comes with AI and their political philosophy.\u201d\n\nOnstage, I mentioned to Khosla my recent sit-down with FTC Chair Lina Khan, who does not believe in the national champions model as a reason to coddle outfits like Google or OpenAI as they further their development of AI.\n\nKhan hears all the time from executives and investors who say that government intervention will put the U.S. on a dangerous path. But during my sit-down with Khan, she argued that time and again, the U.S. has chosen \u201cthe path of competition\u201d and it has \u201cended up fueling and catalyzing so many of these breakthrough innovations and so much of the remarkable growth that our country has enjoyed and that has allowed us to stay ahead globally.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you look at some other countries that instead chose that national champions model,\u201d Khan added at the time, \u201cthey\u2019re the ones who got left behind.\u201d\n\nI had barely mentioned Khan, however, when Khosla became dismissive, calling her \u201cnot a rational human being\u201d and accusing her of not understanding business.\n\nA close-up shot of Vinod Khosla at the Collision conference. Image Credits: Vaughn Ridley / Collison\n\n\u201c[Khan] shouldn\u2019t be in that role,\u201d said Khosla. \u201cAntitrust is a good thing to have in any country, any economic system. But antitrust [that\u2019s] over enforced or over executed is bad economic policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne thing the U.S. has over its European rivals is much more rational business environments. That\u2019s why the Europeans have regulated themselves out of leading in any technology area; they just basically have regulated themselves out of AI, out of all social media, out of all internet startups,\u201d he said.\n\nOf course, if some antitrust enforcement is good, but too much is not good, the question is where to draw the line. On this point, before we parted ways, I brought up the \u201cabundance\u201d that Altman foresees created by AI. During one of TechCrunch\u2019s StrictlyVC events last year, Altman said that the \u201cgood case\u201d for AI is \u201cjust so unbelievably good that you sound like a really crazy person to start talking about it.\u201d\n\nKhosla has said he believes the same. But I\u2019ve long wondered how, exactly, society will enjoy all this upside if regulators don\u2019t get more involved in the trajectory of these companies. After all, I told Khosla onstage, we\u2019ve already seen a massive aggregation of wealth and power tied to a smaller and smaller group of companies and individuals. When will enough be enough?\n\nHere, Khosla said the issue bothers him greatly. \u201cI think 25 years from now, when I hope I\u2019m still working \u2026 the need to work will mostly disappear.\u201d Still, while AI should create \u201cgreat abundance, great GDP growth, great productivity \u2014 all the things economists measure,\u201d he said, he worries \u201cmore than anything else\u201d about \u201cincreasing income disparity. How do we [ensure the] equitable distribution of the benefits of AI?\u201d\n\nHe has an inkling where the tipping point might be. \u201cIf [U.S] GDP growth goes from 2% today \u2014 it\u2019s less than 1% in Europe right now \u2014 to 4%, 5%, 6%, we\u2019ll have enough abundance to share the wealth and share the benefits.\u201d\n\nWhether and how that happens, of course, are even bigger questions, and for all his brilliance, Khosla, a self-described techno optimist, didn\u2019t have the answers.\n\nInstead, after one last closing remark, he thanked the crowd for their time. Then he walked offstage, where a dozen young founders were gathered in the wings, each of them hoping to bend his ear for as long as they could.", "authors": "['Connie Loizos']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/53800655026_a615ec2ef8_k.jpg?resize=1200,800", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/23/what-vinod-khosla-says-hes-worried-about-the-most/", "timestamp": "1719367057.9616919", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "\u200b\u200bWhat Vinod Khosla says he\u2019s \u2018worried about the most\u2019", "text": "Vinod Khosla is more popular than ever right now. The Sun Microsystems co-founder turned prominent investor \u2014 first at Kleiner Perkins and, for the last 20 years, at his venture firm Khosla Ventures \u2014 has always been sought after by founders thanks to his no-nonsense advice and his firm\u2019s track record, including bets on Stripe, Square, Affirm, and DoorDash. But a $50 million gamble on OpenAI back in 2019 \u2014 when it was far from clear that the outfit would succeed on the scale that it has \u2014 put Khosla Ventures, and Khosla himself, squarely in the spotlight.\n\nHe\u2019s thoroughly enjoying himself. I sat down with Khosla this past week in Toronto at the Collision conference, and ahead of our stage appearance, he told me that he\u2019s been appearing in public \u2014 either onstage or on podcasts or television interviews \u2014 several times a week lately. Asked if he was exhausted by the schedule \u2014 for example, he flew into Toronto just hours before our sit-down \u2014 he shrugged off the suggestion.\n\nCertainly, there are things he prefers to talk about, and the art of deal-making is not among these things. \u201cFrankly, the investor side is much less interesting to me,\u201d he said when I asked him about something I heard recently, which is that he hasn\u2019t taken a dollar in management fees since starting Khosla Ventures, despite that it now has $18 billion in assets under management. (He confirmed this, but he said that\u2019s only true of himself and not a corporate-wide policy.)\n\nHe\u2019s much more passionate about the startup opportunities he spies in a landscape being changed daily by advances in AI, so we talked about some of this white space. We also talked about what concerns him the most about AI\u2019s ripple effects; FTC Chair Lina Khan; and why, in his view, the \u201cEuropeans have regulated themselves out of leading in any technology area.\u201d\n\nWe talked first about Apple\u2019s splashy new deal with OpenAI, which allows Apple to integrate ChatGPT into Siri and its generative AI tools. Apple may be striking similar deals with other AI models, including with Meta, but naturally, as an OpenAI investor, Khosla is bullish on the tie-up, which is the only one Apple has announced publicly so far.\n\nKhosla called it \u201cvalidation\u201d for OpenAI; by announcing its pact with OpenAI during its high-profile developers\u2019 conference, Apple was also \u201cexpressing confidence, I believe, in [OpenAI CEO] Sam [Altman] to lead [developments in AI] the next five or 10 years,\u201d said Khosla. \u201cWhen a company like Apple bets on a technology, they don\u2019t change it the next year usually.\u201d\n\nBut was it good news and also bad news for Khosla, I wondered? As we\u2019ve noted in TechCrunch, many startups will likely be disrupted right out of existence by some of Apple\u2019s newest features, and it seemed likely that Khosla\u2019s portfolio companies aren\u2019t entirely immune. I was especially curious about Rabbit, whose AI-powered hardware device promises to be a kind of AI assistant to users and is backed by Khosla Ventures.\n\nVinod Khosla onstage at Collision with TechCrunch editor-in-chief Connie Loizos. Image Credits: Vaughn Ridley / Collision\n\nAsked if the device could be made obsolete by Apple, Khosla suggested the device is more flexible than people imagine and could wind up being used by enterprises like hospitals, including in emergency room environments. He put it in the growing array of things that will \u201cwatch what you do, see what you do, and respond automatically.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Khosla suggested that his team has actively avoided anything that could become \u201croadkill\u201d as large language models like that of OpenAI progress further. And he highlighted at least one company that\u2019s not in his portfolio: Grammarly, a writing assistant startup that was valued by its backers not so long ago at $13 billion.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re doing Grammarly, say, it\u2019s really a light wrapper on today\u2019s model, and Grammarly won\u2019t keep up; it should never have been an app. It shows the need for that capability, but it will be part of Word or Google Docs. It\u2019s pretty obvious. When we talk to YC companies or others,\u201d Khosla continued, \u201cI can usually say, \u2018Half of these companies will be obsolete before the YC batch is over.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhere Khosla sees plenty of opportunities are in verticals where expertise will become near free, although it\u2019s not clear to me how these companies will sustainably make money (even after asking him). Think tutoring, or even oncology.\n\nSaid Khosla: \u201cOpen AI or Google isn\u2019t going to build a chip designer [to have on your smartphone]. OpenAI and Google aren\u2019t going to build a structural engineer. They\u2019re not going to build a primary care doctor or a mental health therapist,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there are so many areas for [founders to mine]. But they have to look at where the models are going next year and five years from now, and say, \u2018We want to leverage that capability.\u2019\u201d\n\nWe also talked about regulation. I observed that Khosla has said before that closed large language models like that of OpenAI should be safeguarded, even while there should be a regulatory framework around them. I wondered if that means that Khosla will forever forswear other, \u201copen source\u201d AI.\n\nNot at all, he said, noting that he\u2019s a \u201chuge fan\u201d of open source. Sun was one of the first companies to \u201cjump on open source,\u201d opening sourcing its file system, he said. He also noted that Khosla Ventures was the earliest investor in GitLab, whose software invites people to work on code jointly.\n\nBut he suggested that open source in the context of large language models is a different animal altogether. The \u201clargest risk we face with AI is China\u201d and \u201cpowerful Chinese AI\u201d that competes with the \u201cliberal values\u201d of the U.S., he said, adding that \u201cwe need to make sure that China stays behind us.\u201d Otherwise, he warned, it will be China providing the \u201cfree doctors and free oncologists\u201d to the rest of the world and, while they are at it, they\u2019ll \u201cexport both the economic power that comes with AI and their political philosophy.\u201d\n\nOnstage, I mentioned to Khosla my recent sit-down with FTC Chair Lina Khan, who does not believe in the national champions model as a reason to coddle outfits like Google or OpenAI as they further their development of AI.\n\nKhan hears all the time from executives and investors who say that government intervention will put the U.S. on a dangerous path. But during my sit-down with Khan, she argued that time and again, the U.S. has chosen \u201cthe path of competition\u201d and it has \u201cended up fueling and catalyzing so many of these breakthrough innovations and so much of the remarkable growth that our country has enjoyed and that has allowed us to stay ahead globally.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you look at some other countries that instead chose that national champions model,\u201d Khan added at the time, \u201cthey\u2019re the ones who got left behind.\u201d\n\nI had barely mentioned Khan, however, when Khosla became dismissive, calling her \u201cnot a rational human being\u201d and accusing her of not understanding business.\n\nA close-up shot of Vinod Khosla at the Collision conference. Image Credits: Vaughn Ridley / Collison\n\n\u201c[Khan] shouldn\u2019t be in that role,\u201d said Khosla. \u201cAntitrust is a good thing to have in any country, any economic system. But antitrust [that\u2019s] over enforced or over executed is bad economic policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne thing the U.S. has over its European rivals is much more rational business environments. That\u2019s why the Europeans have regulated themselves out of leading in any technology area; they just basically have regulated themselves out of AI, out of all social media, out of all internet startups,\u201d he said.\n\nOf course, if some antitrust enforcement is good, but too much is not good, the question is where to draw the line. On this point, before we parted ways, I brought up the \u201cabundance\u201d that Altman foresees created by AI. During one of TechCrunch\u2019s StrictlyVC events last year, Altman said that the \u201cgood case\u201d for AI is \u201cjust so unbelievably good that you sound like a really crazy person to start talking about it.\u201d\n\nKhosla has said he believes the same. But I\u2019ve long wondered how, exactly, society will enjoy all this upside if regulators don\u2019t get more involved in the trajectory of these companies. After all, I told Khosla onstage, we\u2019ve already seen a massive aggregation of wealth and power tied to a smaller and smaller group of companies and individuals. When will enough be enough?\n\nHere, Khosla said the issue bothers him greatly. \u201cI think 25 years from now, when I hope I\u2019m still working \u2026 the need to work will mostly disappear.\u201d Still, while AI should create \u201cgreat abundance, great GDP growth, great productivity \u2014 all the things economists measure,\u201d he said, he worries \u201cmore than anything else\u201d about \u201cincreasing income disparity. How do we [ensure the] equitable distribution of the benefits of AI?\u201d\n\nHe has an inkling where the tipping point might be. \u201cIf [U.S] GDP growth goes from 2% today \u2014 it\u2019s less than 1% in Europe right now \u2014 to 4%, 5%, 6%, we\u2019ll have enough abundance to share the wealth and share the benefits.\u201d\n\nWhether and how that happens, of course, are even bigger questions, and for all his brilliance, Khosla, a self-described techno optimist, didn\u2019t have the answers.\n\nInstead, after one last closing remark, he thanked the crowd for their time. Then he walked offstage, where a dozen young founders were gathered in the wings, each of them hoping to bend his ear for as long as they could.", "authors": "['Connie Loizos']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/53800655026_a615ec2ef8_k.jpg?resize=1200,800", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/23/what-vinod-khosla-says-hes-worried-about-the-most/", "timestamp": "1719367060.7970061", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "Women in AI: Anika Collier Navaroli is working to shift the power imbalance", "text": "To give AI-focused women academics and others their well-deserved \u2014 and overdue \u2014 time in the spotlight, TechCrunch is launching a series of interviews focusing on remarkable women who\u2019ve contributed to the AI revolution.\n\nAnika Collier Navaroli is a senior fellow at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University and a Technology Public Voices Fellow with the OpEd Project, held in collaboration with the MacArthur Foundation.\n\nShe is known for her research and advocacy work within technology. Previously, she worked as a race and technology practitioner fellow at the Stanford Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society. Before this, she led Trust & Safety at Twitch and Twitter. Navaroli is perhaps best known for her congressional testimony about Twitter, where she spoke about the ignored warnings of impending violence on social media that prefaced what would become the January 6 Capitol attack.\n\nBriefly, how did you get your start in AI? What attracted you to the field?\n\nAbout 20 years ago, I was working as a copy clerk in the newsroom of my hometown paper during the summer when it went digital. Back then, I was an undergrad studying journalism. Social media sites like Facebook were sweeping over my campus, and I became obsessed with trying to understand how laws built on the printing press would evolve with emerging technologies. That curiosity led me through law school, where I migrated to Twitter, studied media law and policy, and I watched the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street movements play out. I put it all together and wrote my master\u2019s thesis about how new technology was transforming the way information flowed and how society exercised freedom of expression.\n\nI worked at a couple law firms after graduation and then found my way to Data & Society Research Institute leading the new think tank\u2019s research on what was then called \u201cbig data,\u201d civil rights, and fairness. My work there looked at how early AI systems like facial recognition software, predictive policing tools, and criminal justice risk assessment algorithms were replicating bias and creating unintended consequences that impacted marginalized communities. I then went on to work at Color of Change and lead the first civil rights audit of a tech company, develop the organization\u2019s playbook for tech accountability campaigns, and advocate for tech policy changes to governments and regulators. From there, I became a senior policy official inside Trust & Safety teams at Twitter and Twitch.\n\nWhat work are you most proud of in the AI field?\n\nI am the most proud of my work inside of technology companies using policy to practically shift the balance of power and correct bias within culture and knowledge-producing algorithmic systems. At Twitter, I ran a couple campaigns to verify individuals who shockingly had been previously excluded from the exclusive verification process, including Black women, people of color, and queer folks. This also included leading AI scholars like Safiya Noble, Alondra Nelson, Timnit Gebru, and Meredith Broussard. This was in 2020 when Twitter was still Twitter. Back then, verification meant that your name and content became a part of Twitter\u2019s core algorithm because tweets from verified accounts were injected into recommendations, search results, home timelines, and contributed toward the creation of trends. So working to verify new people with different perspectives on AI fundamentally shifted whose voices were given authority as thought leaders and elevated new ideas into the public conversation during some really critical moments.\n\nI\u2019m also very proud of the research I conducted at Stanford that came together as Black in Moderation. When I was working inside of tech companies, I also noticed that no one was really writing or talking about the experiences that I was having every day as a Black person working in Trust & Safety. So when I left the industry and went back into academia, I decided to speak with Black tech workers and bring to light their stories. The research ended up being the first of its kind and has spurred so many new and important conversations about the experiences of tech employees with marginalized identities.\n\nHow do you navigate the challenges of the male-dominated tech industry and, by extension, the male-dominated AI industry?\n\nAs a Black queer woman, navigating male-dominated spaces and spaces where I am othered has been a part of my entire life journey. Within tech and AI, I think the most challenging aspect has been what I call in my research \u201ccompelled identity labor.\u201d I coined the term to describe frequent situations where employees with marginalized identities are treated as the voices and/or representatives of entire communities who share their identities.\n\nBecause of the high stakes that come with developing new technology like AI, that labor can sometimes feel almost impossible to escape. I had to learn to set very specific boundaries for myself about what issues I was willing to engage with and when.\n\nWhat are some of the most pressing issues facing AI as it evolves?\n\nAccording to investigative reporting, current generative AI models have gobbled up all the data on the internet and will soon run out of available data to devour. So the largest AI companies in the world are turning to synthetic data, or information generated by AI itself, rather than humans, to continue to train their systems.\n\nThe idea took me down a rabbit hole. So, I recently wrote an Op-Ed arguing that I think this use of synthetic data as training data is one of the most pressing ethical issues facing new AI development. Generative AI systems have already shown that based on their original training data, their output is to replicate bias and create false information. So the pathway of training new systems with synthetic data would mean constantly feeding biased and inaccurate outputs back into the system as new training data. I described this as potentially devolving into a feedback loop to hell.\n\nSince I wrote the piece, Mark Zuckerberg lauded that Meta\u2019s updated Llama 3 chatbot was partially powered by synthetic data and was the \u201cmost intelligent\u201d generative AI product on the market.\n\nWhat are some issues AI users should be aware of?\n\nAI is such an omnipresent part of our present lives, from spellcheck and social media feeds to chatbots and image generators. In many ways, society has become the guinea pig for the experiments of this new, untested technology. But AI users shouldn\u2019t feel powerless.\n\nI\u2019ve been arguing that technology advocates should come together and organize AI users to call for a People Pause on AI. I think that the Writers Guild of America has shown that with organization, collective action, and patient resolve, people can come together to create meaningful boundaries for the use of AI technologies. I also believe that if we pause now to fix the mistakes of the past and create new ethical guidelines and regulation, AI doesn\u2019t have to become an existential threat to our futures.\n\nWhat is the best way to responsibly build AI?\n\nMy experience working inside of tech companies showed me how much it matters who is in the room writing policies, presenting arguments, and making decisions. My pathway also showed me that I developed the skills I needed to succeed within the technology industry by starting in journalism school. I\u2019m now back working at Columbia Journalism School and I am interested in training up the next generation of people who will do the work of technology accountability and responsibly developing AI both inside of tech companies and as external watchdogs.\n\nI think [journalism] school gives people such unique training in interrogating information, seeking truth, considering multiple viewpoints, creating logical arguments, and distilling facts and reality from opinion and misinformation. I believe that\u2019s a solid foundation for the people who will be responsible for writing the rules for what the next iterations of AI can and cannot do. And I\u2019m looking forward to creating a more paved pathway for those who come next.\n\nI also believe that in addition to skilled Trust & Safety workers, the AI industry needs external regulation. In the U.S., I argue that this should come in the form of a new agency to regulate American technology companies with the power to establish and enforce baseline safety and privacy standards. I\u2019d also like to continue to work to connect current and future regulators with former tech workers who can help those in power ask the right questions and create new nuanced and practical solutions.", "authors": "['Dominic-Madori Davis']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/women-in-ai-navaroli.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/23/women-in-ai-anika-collier-navaroli-is-working-to-shift-the-power-imbalance/", "timestamp": "1719367068.667861", "displayed": 0}

Navaroli is perhaps best known for her congressional testimony about Twitter, where she spoke about the ignored warnings of impending violence on social media that prefaced what would become the January 6 Capitol attack.\n\nBriefly, how did you get your start in AI? What attracted you to the field?\n\nAbout 20 years ago, I was working as a copy clerk in the newsroom of my hometown paper during the summer when it went digital. Back then, I was an undergrad studying journalism. Social media sites like Facebook were sweeping over my campus, and I became obsessed with trying to understand how laws built on the printing press would evolve with emerging technologies. That curiosity led me through law school, where I migrated to Twitter, studied media law and policy, and I watched the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street movements play out. I put it all together and wrote my master\u2019s thesis about how new technology was transforming the way information flowed and how society exercised freedom of expression.\n\nI worked at a couple law firms after graduation and then found my way to Data & Society Research Institute leading the new think tank\u2019s research on what was then called \u201cbig data,\u201d civil rights, and fairness. My work there looked at how early AI systems like facial recognition software, predictive policing tools, and criminal justice risk assessment algorithms were replicating bias and creating unintended consequences that impacted marginalized communities. I then went on to work at Color of Change and lead the first civil rights audit of a tech company, develop the organization\u2019s playbook for tech accountability campaigns, and advocate for tech policy changes to governments and regulators. From there, I became a senior policy official inside Trust & Safety teams at Twitter and Twitch.\n\nWhat work are you most proud of in the AI field?\n\nI am the most proud of my work inside of technology companies using policy to practically shift the balance of power and correct bias within culture and knowledge-producing algorithmic systems. At Twitter, I ran a couple campaigns to verify individuals who shockingly had been previously excluded from the exclusive verification process, including Black women, people of color, and queer folks. This also included leading AI scholars like Safiya Noble, Alondra Nelson, Timnit Gebru, and Meredith Broussard. This was in 2020 when Twitter was still Twitter. Back then, verification meant that your name and content became a part of Twitter\u2019s core algorithm because tweets from verified accounts were injected into recommendations, search results, home timelines, and contributed toward the creation of trends. So working to verify new people with different perspectives on AI fundamentally shifted whose voices were given authority as thought leaders and elevated new ideas into the public conversation during some really critical moments.\n\nI\u2019m also very proud of the research I conducted at Stanford that came together as Black in Moderation. When I was working inside of tech companies, I also noticed that no one was really writing or talking about the experiences that I was having every day as a Black person working in Trust & Safety. So when I left the industry and went back into academia, I decided to speak with Black tech workers and bring to light their stories. The research ended up being the first of its kind and has spurred so many new and important conversations about the experiences of tech employees with marginalized identities.\n\nHow do you navigate the challenges of the male-dominated tech industry and, by extension, the male-dominated AI industry?\n\nAs a Black queer woman, navigating male-dominated spaces and spaces where I am othered has been a part of my entire life journey. Within tech and AI, I think the most challenging aspect has been what I call in my research \u201ccompelled identity labor.\u201d I coined the term to describe frequent situations where employees with marginalized identities are treated as the voices and/or representatives of entire communities who share their identities.\n\nBecause of the high stakes that come with developing new technology like AI, that labor can sometimes feel almost impossible to escape. I had to learn to set very specific boundaries for myself about what issues I was willing to engage with and when.\n\nWhat are some of the most pressing issues facing AI as it evolves?\n\nAccording to investigative reporting, current generative AI models have gobbled up all the data on the internet and will soon run out of available data to devour. So the largest AI companies in the world are turning to synthetic data, or information generated by AI itself, rather than humans, to continue to train their systems.\n\nThe idea took me down a rabbit hole. So, I recently wrote an Op-Ed arguing that I think this use of synthetic data as training data is one of the most pressing ethical issues facing new AI development. Generative AI systems have already shown that based on their original training data, their output is to replicate bias and create false information. So the pathway of training new systems with synthetic data would mean constantly feeding biased and inaccurate outputs back into the system as new training data. I described this as potentially devolving into a feedback loop to hell.\n\nSince I wrote the piece, Mark Zuckerberg lauded that Meta\u2019s updated Llama 3 chatbot was partially powered by synthetic data and was the \u201cmost intelligent\u201d generative AI product on the market.\n\nWhat are some issues AI users should be aware of?\n\nAI is such an omnipresent part of our present lives, from spellcheck and social media feeds to chatbots and image generators. In many ways, society has become the guinea pig for the experiments of this new, untested technology. But AI users shouldn\u2019t feel powerless.\n\nI\u2019ve been arguing that technology advocates should come together and organize AI users to call for a People Pause on AI. I think that the Writers Guild of America has shown that with organization, collective action, and patient resolve, people can come together to create meaningful boundaries for the use of AI technologies. I also believe that if we pause now to fix the mistakes of the past and create new ethical guidelines and regulation, AI doesn\u2019t have to become an existential threat to our futures.\n\nWhat is the best way to responsibly build AI?\n\nMy experience working inside of tech companies showed me how much it matters who is in the room writing policies, presenting arguments, and making decisions. My pathway also showed me that I developed the skills I needed to succeed within the technology industry by starting in journalism school. I\u2019m now back working at Columbia Journalism School and I am interested in training up the next generation of people who will do the work of technology accountability and responsibly developing AI both inside of tech companies and as external watchdogs.\n\nI think [journalism] school gives people such unique training in interrogating information, seeking truth, considering multiple viewpoints, creating logical arguments, and distilling facts and reality from opinion and misinformation. I believe that\u2019s a solid foundation for the people who will be responsible for writing the rules for what the next iterations of AI can and cannot do. And I\u2019m looking forward to creating a more paved pathway for those who come next.\n\nI also believe that in addition to skilled Trust & Safety workers, the AI industry needs external regulation. In the U.S., I argue that this should come in the form of a new agency to regulate American technology companies with the power to establish and enforce baseline safety and privacy standards. I\u2019d also like to continue to work to connect current and future regulators with former tech workers who can help those in power ask the right questions and create new nuanced and practical solutions.", "authors": "['Dominic-Madori Davis']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/women-in-ai-navaroli.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/23/women-in-ai-anika-collier-navaroli-is-working-to-shift-the-power-imbalance/", "timestamp": "1719367071.4087381", "displayed": 0}

On LinkedIn, however, the startup community gave a less-than-enthusiastic response. Those commenters pointed out that Wang\u2019s post made it seem as if \u201cmeritocracy\u201d was the definitive benchmark to find qualified hiring candidates \u2014 without taking into consideration that the idea of meritocracy is itself subjective. In the days that have followed the post, more and more people have shared their thoughts and what Wang\u2019s comments reveal about the current state of DEI in tech.\n\n\u201cThe post is misguided because people who support the meritocracy argument are ignoring the structural reasons some groups are more likely to outperform others,\u201d Mutale Nkonde, a founder working in AI policy, told TechCrunch. \u201dWe all want the best people for the job, and there is data to prove that diverse teams are more effective.\u201d\n\nEmily Witko, an HR professional at AI startup Hugging Face, told TechCrunch that the post was a \u201cdangerous oversimplification,\u201d but that it received so much attention on X because it \u201copenly expressed sentiments that are not always expressed publicly and the audience there is hungry to attack DEI.\u201d Wang\u2019s MEI thought \u201cmakes it so easy to refute or criticize any conversations regarding the importance of acknowledging underrepresentation in tech,\u201d she continued.\n\nBut Wang is far from the only Silicon Valley insider to attack DEI in recent months. He joins a chorus of those who feel that DEI programs implemented at businesses over the past several years, peaking with the Black Lives Matter movement, caused a backslide in corporate profitability \u2014 and that a return to \u201cmeritocratic principles\u201d is overdue. Indeed, much of the tech industry has worked to dismantle recruitment programs that considered candidates who, under previous hiring regimes, were often overlooked in the hiring process.\n\nSeeking to make a change, in 2020, many organizations and power players came together to promise more of a focus on DEI, which, contrary to the mainstream discussion, is not simply about hiring someone based on the color of their skin but is about ensuring qualified people from all walks of life \u2014 regardless of skin, gender, or ethnic background \u2014 are better represented and included in recruitment funnels.

And his post suggests that Scale AI\u2019s values could align with the spirit of diversity, equity, and inclusion even if he might not realize it, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cCasting a wide net for talent and making objective hiring decisions that do not disadvantage candidates based on identity is exactly what diversity, equity, and inclusion work seeks to do,\u201d she explained.\n\nBut again, where Wang undermines this is endorsing the mistaken belief that meritocracy will produce outcomes based on one\u2019s abilities and merits alone.\n\nPerhaps it is all a paradox.

Fitzgerald will head off to Duke in the fall and Van Landschoot will move near the university but is putting his college plans on hold to be a full-time startup founder.\n\nThe money was raised while they were still in high school after a prototype for their idea garnered a lot of interest among the large Boulder community of AI enthusiasts.\n\nAPIGen is working on a platform that will build custom APIs from natural language prompts. It will be able to, for instance, allow an e-commerce business to simply ask for an API that connects its web front end to its database, and the platform will deliver it.\n\nBy API, the founders don\u2019t just mean a standard \u201capplication programming interface\u201d that allows applications to exchange data or perform some other simple workflow function. They want APIGen to create complex custom APIs that can do multiple or serial tasks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually generating the code for the APIs so that you can have business logic, actual custom functionalities within those APIs as well,\u201d Van Landschoot told TechCrunch.\n\nIn addition to web apps and databases, Fitzgerald says IoT devices are one of his startup\u2019s target areas. He offers the example of a customer asking for an API that instructs a drone to fly around the perimeter of an area, capture images and allow another application to interface with the result. Another example is an API that uses face recognition for building security. Once a database of photos of verified employee faces is created, the user could ask APIGen for an API that lets a smartlock\u2019s door camera check the face of everyone who arrives against that database before unlocking the door.\n\n\u201cAPIs at the end of the day, can be as simple or as complex as you make them to be,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cThey can range from just new connectors that take one entry of data, one row of data from a table of a database, to entire back ends. And that\u2019s really what we\u2019re trying to target there, for entire web apps for entire IoT applications.\u201d\n\nThe teens met on their school\u2019s debate team and bonded over their love of coding. Their first project together was a chatbot that would allow people to chat with data. They soon realized that it wasn\u2019t an original idea. Still, while building that app, they learned that their tech relied on APIs and that \u201cmaking APIs was kind of a pain,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cThey were hard to design.\u201d\n\nSo they focused on that. Once they crafted an alpha version of their idea, a demo-level tool, they began to show it around to the programmers in their circle to get feedback. They knew people in their local tech industry. Van Landschoot\u2019s dad works in cybersecurity IT, and Fitzgerald landed a summer internship at SoftBank through a connection with a friend\u2019s dad.\n\nAnd then they started sending cold messages to VCs on LinkedIn and to anyone else they thought might respond.\n\n\u201cWe asked people to destroy this pitch deck,\u201d Fitzgerald said.\n\nPhil Broenniman (left), Ankur Ahuja (right), Varana Capital Image Credits: Varana Capital\n\nA VC is so impressed, he offers to invest\n\nOne of the people who got the message \u2014 and had heard about the founders through other connections in Denver/Boulder\u2019s tight-knit startup community \u2014 was Philip Broenniman, founder of Denver\u2019s Varana Capital. Varana began as a family office for Broenniman and a partner 13 years ago, and has since expanded into a firm with institutional LP money and $400 million in AUM, he told TechCrunch\n\nBroenniman and Varana COO Ankur Ahuja agreed to meet with the teens. \u201cWe went into the meeting thinking we were going to provide some fatherly, avuncular advice; provide some words of wisdom,\u201d Broenniman told TechCrunch. \u201cWe walked out after two hours of their presentation thinking that this was the best presentation we had heard in the last five years. We were blown away by the cogent insights these two 18-year-olds gave.\u201d\n\nWith Fitzgerald dressed in his best sweater and Van Landschoot in a debate-team-style collared shirt, they leaned into their debate training and pitched their company, their vision, the potential market and themselves.\n\nRather than feedback on the pitch, \u201cAt the end of the meeting, they mentioned that they were actually interested,\u201d Fitzgerald said of the Varana partners. Broenniman asked the teens how much money they were looking for.\n\nVarana did its diligence looking into the potential of the API market, which has created multibillion dollars\u2019 worth of successes (MuleSoft bought by Salesforce, Apigee bought by Google, to name just two). And it looked at the founders\u2019 backgrounds: Fitzgerald graduated as valedictorian of a top-ranked high school in Boulder, which has a highly ranked public education system; Van Landschoot was such a gifted programmer that he had been tutoring college computer science students since he was 14.\n\nThe Varana partners scheduled a second meeting for the founders to demo their tech to make sure the teens weren\u2019t just \u201cgood at talking but not delivering and doing stuff,\u201d as Van Landschoot described.\n\nThe teens were nervous, they confessed, but the demo went well and the VC offered a term sheet: $250,000 of pre-seed money with another $250,000 in a SAFE, which is a note that converts to equity if the startup raises later. The VC also provided office space.\n\nWhile they were pitching to the VCs, Fitzgerald learned about Boulder\u2019s active AI Meetup that has 1,400 members, organized by a dad of one of Fitzgerald\u2019s tennis team teammates. Boulder has a famously close and cozy startup community and, along with nearby Denver, hosts office outposts for Amazon, IBM, Google, Microsoft and many others.\n\nThe teens joined the group and demoed their product, and the local AI enthusiasts rallied behind them and their idea.\n\nAPIGen is obviously very early. And it isn\u2019t the only one working on automating APIs. Giant tech companies like Salesforce\u2019s MuleSoft and established startups like RapidAPI are already working on this market, as are most of the cloud giants.\n\nAPIGen also doesn\u2019t yet have its minimum viable product built, though it\u2019s getting closer with a beta version that will be released this month. \u201cWe\u2019ve already had some interest from businesses, but obviously we\u2019re still pre-MVP at this stage, and just cranking, trying to get it out as soon as possible,\u201d Fitzgerald said.\n\nStill, Broenniman, who takes board seats with investments, is in for the ride. He points to how the young founders have already built a community of eager supporters.\n\n\u201cAPIGen may be the vehicle into which we\u2019re making an investment, but we\u2019re creating partnership with Christopher and Nicholas,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a $7 billion-plus market. They are entering with some elements of competition there but are carving out their own space.

And, given the scale of these companies, off-the-shelf data models are typically not sufficient.\u201d\n\nSo Pojawis and Maran founded OmniAI, a set of tools that transform unstructured enterprise data into something that data analytics apps and AI can understand.\n\nImage Credits: OmniAI\n\nOmniAI syncs with a company\u2019s data storage services and databases (e.g., Snowflake, MongoDB, etc.), preps the data within and allows companies to run the model of their choice \u2014 for example, a large language model \u2014 on the data.

Customers sign a software-as-a-service contract with OmniAI to enable management of models on their infrastructure.\n\nIt\u2019s early days. But Omni, which recently closed a $3.2 million seed round led by FundersClub at a $30 million valuation, claims to have 10 customers already, including Klaviyo and Carrefour. Annual recurring revenue is on track to reach $1 million by 2025, Maran said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re an incredibly lean team in a fast-growing industry,\u201d Maran said. \u201cOur bet is that, over time, companies will opt for running models alongside their existing infrastructure, and model providers will focus more on licensing model weights to existing cloud providers.\u201d", "authors": "['Kyle Wiggers']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1652364481.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/22/omniai-transforms-business-data-for-ai/", "timestamp": "1719367092.694346", "displayed": 0}

And, given the scale of these companies, off-the-shelf data models are typically not sufficient.\u201d\n\nSo Pojawis and Maran founded OmniAI, a set of tools that transform unstructured enterprise data into something that data analytics apps and AI can understand.\n\nImage Credits: OmniAI\n\nOmniAI syncs with a company\u2019s data storage services and databases (e.g., Snowflake, MongoDB, etc.), preps the data within and allows companies to run the model of their choice \u2014 for example, a large language model \u2014 on the data. OmniAI performs all of its work in the company\u2019s cloud, OmniAI\u2019s private cloud or on-premises environments, delivering ostensibly improved security, according to Maran.\n\n\u201cWe believe that large language models will become essential to a company\u2019s infrastructure in the next decade, and having everything hosted in one place just makes sense,\u201d Maran said.\n\nOut of the box, OmniAI offers integrations with models, including Meta\u2019s Llama 3, Anthropic\u2019s Claude, Mistral\u2019s Mistral Large and Amazon\u2019s AWS Titan for use cases like automatically redacting sensitive information from data and generally building AI-powered applications. Customers sign a software-as-a-service contract with OmniAI to enable management of models on their infrastructure.\n\nIt\u2019s early days. But Omni, which recently closed a $3.2 million seed round led by FundersClub at a $30 million valuation, claims to have 10 customers already, including Klaviyo and Carrefour. Annual recurring revenue is on track to reach $1 million by 2025, Maran said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re an incredibly lean team in a fast-growing industry,\u201d Maran said. \u201cOur bet is that, over time, companies will opt for running models alongside their existing infrastructure, and model providers will focus more on licensing model weights to existing cloud providers.\u201d", "authors": "['Kyle Wiggers']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1652364481.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/22/omniai-transforms-business-data-for-ai/", "timestamp": "1719367095.4113011", "displayed": 0}

She\u2019s also an AI expert consultant at the African Union High Level Panel on Emerging Technologies and works on the AU-AI continental Strategy titled \u201cHarnessing Artificial Intelligence for Africa\u2019s Socio-Economic Development\u201d with a focus on shaping the AI governance landscape in Africa.\n\nN\u2019Guessan has also co-authored several publications and is the first woman recipient of the Africa Prize for Engineering Innovation awarded by the Royal Academy of Engineering.\n\nBriefly, how did you get your start in AI? What attracted you to the field?\n\nI have an engineering background from a formal and informal education. I have always been passionate about the use of technology to build solutions that would positively impact my communities. This ambition led me to relocate to Ghana in 2017, where I aimed to learn from the anglophone market and kickstart my tech entrepreneurial journey.\n\nIn the development process of my startup, my former co-founders and I conducted market research to identify challenges in the financial sector, resulting in online identity fraud. We then decided to build a secure, reliable, and effective solution for financial institutions to bridge the gap in serving the unbanked populations in remote areas and establish online trust. This led to a software solution leveraging facial recognition and AI technologies, tailored to facilitate organizations in processing online client ID verification while ensuring our model was trained with representative data from the African market. This marked my initial involvement in the AI industry. Note that in 2023, despite our efforts, we encountered various challenges that led us to stop commercializing our product on the market. However, this experience fueled my determination to continue working in the AI field.\n\nWhat attracted me to AI was the realization of its immense power as a tool for solving societal problems. Once you grasp the technology, you can see its potential to address a wide range of issues. This understanding fueled my passion for AI and continues to drive my work in the field today.\n\nWhat work are you most proud of in the AI field?\n\nI am incredibly proud of my journey as a deep tech entrepreneur. Building an AI-driven startup in Africa isn\u2019t easy, so for those who have embarked on this journey, it\u2019s a significant achievement. This experience has been a major milestone in my professional career, and I am grateful for the challenges and opportunities it has brought.\n\nCurrently, I am proud of the work we do at Amini, where we are tackling the challenge of data scarcity on the African continent. Having faced this issue as a former founder myself, I am very grateful to work with inspiring and talented problem solvers. Today, my team and I have developed a solution by building a data infrastructure using space technology and AI to make data accessible and comprehensible. Our work is a game-changer and a crucial starting point for more data-driven products to emerge in the African market.\n\nHow do you navigate the challenges of the male-dominated tech industry and, by extension, the male-dominated AI industry?\n\nTruth is, what we are facing today in the industry has been shaped by societal biases and gender stereotypes. This is a societal mindset that has been nurtured for years. Most of the women working in the AI industry have been told at least once that they were in the wrong industry because they were expected to be A, B, C and D.\n\nWhy should we have to choose? Why should society dictate our paths for us? It\u2019s important to remind ourselves that women have made remarkable contributions to science, leading to some of the most impactful technological advancements that society is benefiting today. They exemplify what women can achieve when provided with education and resources.\n\nI am aware that it takes time to change a mindset, but we can\u2019t wait; we need to continue encouraging girls to study science and embrace careers in AI. Honestly, I\u2019ve seen progress compared to previous years, which gives me hope. I believe that ensuring equal opportunities in the industry will attract more women to AI roles, and providing more access to leadership positions for women will accelerate change toward gender balance in male-dominated industries.\n\nWhat advice would you give to women seeking to enter the AI field?\n\nFocus on your learning and ensure you acquire the skills needed in the AI field. Understand that the industry may expect you to demonstrate your capabilities more intensely compared to your male fellows. Honestly, investing in your skills is crucial and serves as a solid foundation. I believe this will not only boost your confidence in seizing opportunities but also enhance your resilience and professional growth.\n\nWhat are some of the most pressing issues facing AI as it evolves?\n\nSome of the most pressing issues facing AI as it evolves include challenges in articulating its short-term and long-term impacts on humans. This is currently a global conversation due to uncertainty surrounding emerging technologies. While we have witnessed impressive applications of AI in industries globally, including in Africa, particularly with the recent advancements in generative AI solutions and the capability of AI models to process vast volumes of data with minimal latency, we have also observed AI models riddled with various biases and hallucinations. The world is undeniably moving toward a more AI-driven future. However, several questions remain unanswered and need to be addressed:\n\nWhat is the future of humans in the AI loop?\n\nWhat is the appropriate approach for regulators to define policies and laws to mitigate risks in AI models?\n\nWhat does AI responsibility and ethical framework mean?\n\nWho should be held accountable for the outcomes of AI models?\n\nWhat are some issues AI users should be aware of?\n\nI like to remind people that we are all first AI users before any other title. Each of us interacts with AI solutions in various ways, whether it\u2019s directly or through our people (such as family members, friends, etc.) using various devices. That\u2019s why it is important to have an understanding of the technology itself. One of the things you should know is that most AI solutions on the market require your data, and as a user, be curious to understand the extent of control you give the machine over your data. When considering consuming an AI solution, consider data privacy and the security offered by the platform. This is crucial for your protection.\n\nAdditionally, there has been a lot of excitement about generative AI content. However, it\u2019s essential to be cautious about what you generate with these tools and to discern between content that is real and that which is false. For instance, social media users have faced the spread of deepfake-generated content, which serves as an example of how people with malicious intentions can misuse these tools. Always verify the source of generated content before sharing it, to avoid contributing to the problem.\n\nLastly, AI users should be mindful of becoming overly dependent on these tools. Some individuals may become addicted, and we\u2019ve seen instances where users have taken negative actions based on recommendations from AI chats. It\u2019s important to remember that AI models can produce inaccurate outcomes due to societal biases or other factors. In the long-term, users should strive to maintain independence to prevent potential mental health issues arising from unethical AI tools.\n\nWhat is the best way to responsibility build AI?\n\nThis is an interesting topic. I have been working with the High Panel on Emerging Technologies of the African Union as an AI expert consultant, focusing on drafting the AU-AI continental strategy with stakeholders from various backgrounds and countries involved. The goal of this strategy is to guide AU member states to recognize the value of AI for economic growth and develop a framework that supports the development of AI solutions while protecting Africans. Some key principles I always advise considering when building responsible AI for the African market are as follows:\n\nContext matters : Ensure your models are diverse and inclusive to address societal discrimination based on gender, regions, race, age, etc.\n\n: Ensure your models are diverse and inclusive to address societal discrimination based on gender, regions, race, age, etc. Accessibility : Is your solution accessible by your users?

However, one of the challenges is that many investors may lack knowledge and understanding about AI technology. What I have learned is that AI-driven products don\u2019t undergo the same investment risk assessment as other technological products on the market.\n\nTo address this challenge, investors should look beyond trends and deeply evaluate the solution at both the technical and impact levels. This could involve working with industry experts to gain a better understanding of the technical aspects of the AI solution and its potential impact at the short- and long-term.", "authors": "['Dominic-Madori Davis']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/women-in-ai-nguessan.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/22/women-in-ai-charlette-nguessan-is-tackling-data-scarcity-on-the-african-continent/", "timestamp": "1719367098.5168772", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "\u2018What\u2019s in it for us?\u2019 journalists ask as publications sign content deals with AI firms", "text": "Now writers are picking up the pace to put AI protections in contracts\n\nVox Media\u2019s president, Pam Wasserstein, sent her staff a Slack message and an email on May 29 detailing what the company\u2019s journalists say was shocking news: Vox had signed a content licensing deal with OpenAI.\n\nThe deal gives the AI company access to Vox\u2019s current content, as well as the entire archive of its journalistic work, to train ChatGPT and other models. Wasserstein sent the alerts just moments before Axios published an exclusive detailing the licensing and product deal, much to the surprise of her journalists.\n\nWriters at The Atlantic, which signed a similar deal with the Microsoft-backed AI giant, were also sent an email moments before the Axios piece went up.\n\n\u201cAtlantic staffers have largely learned of this agreement from outside sources, and both the company and OpenAI have refused to answer questions about the terms of the deal,\u201d reads a May 30 statement from The Atlantic Union.\n\nNone of the current or former journalists at either company who TechCrunch interviewed had any inkling that their work would be handed over to OpenAI. All of them are concerned that their employers are making short-sighted deals that will ultimately harm writers and journalism as a whole.\n\nBoth Vox Media \u2014 which includes The Verge, New York, Eater, The Cut and more publications \u2014 and The Atlantic have published pieces that are critical of OpenAI and generative AI. They have aired concerns about the environmental impact of the power needed to run large language models, the board upheavals at OpenAI, and the \u201cgeneral lack of trustworthiness\u201d in the company, said Amy McCarthy, a reporter at Eater and communications chair of Vox\u2019s union.\n\nVox did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSince the deals were announced, journalists at each publisher have wrangled meetings with business-side higher-ups to learn more about the agreements, looking for one crucial piece of information: What\u2019s in it for the journalists?\n\nA sense of urgency\n\nIn the face of an increasing number of AI media deals, news guilds are now notching up the pace of negotiations to put in place AI protections similar to the ones Hollywood writing teams fought for.\n\n\u201cThe Writers Guild and Vox Media Union are firmly of the opinion that implementation of AI is a mandatory subject of bargaining, even though our contracts may not explicitly have AI provisions,\u201d McCarthy told TechCrunch. \u201cWe do have provisions in our contract that essentially mean that the company has to bargain with us over fundamental changes to our working conditions, and we very much believe this is a workplace issue, that it\u2019s a working conditions issue, and that the company is obligated to bargain with us about how this will work.\u201d\n\nThis means publishers that strike deals with AI providers might be contractually required to engage in discussions and negotiations with unions about these changes.\n\nThe Atlantic Media Union had also intended to bring this issue to the bargaining table, but the OpenAI deal adds a sense of urgency, one current employee told TechCrunch, requesting anonymity.\n\nDuring negotiations this month, The Atlantic\u2019s union put forward a proposal, per which AI wouldn\u2019t be used to replace writing, fact-checking, copy editing and illustration. It also proposed that writers can use AI at their discretion, in accordance with journalistic principles and ethics, but they can\u2019t be made to use it. That proposal is yet to be accepted.\n\nOther unions are working to put in similar protections. Nebraska journalists at the Omaha World-Herald Guild secured protections from AI earlier this year. In 2023, after CNET published a series of AI-generated articles, journalists at the publication went public with their union drive, demanding AI protections and a say in how AI is implemented in employee workflows.\n\nMaking companies include such safeguards in journalists\u2019 contracts is vital, because protection from the law isn\u2019t guaranteed. Companies like OpenAI contend that they\u2019re not breaking copyright laws by scraping what they say is publicly available content. They also say their chatbots don\u2019t reproduce the material in its entirety.\n\nBut publications like The New York Times, Raw Story, AlterNet and The Intercept have all sued OpenAI for using copyrighted works by journalists to train ChatGPT without properly crediting or citing the sources. Novelists, computer programmers and other groups have also filed copyright suits against OpenAI and other companies building generative AI.\n\nRichard Tofel, former president of nonprofit newsroom ProPublica and a consultant to news outlets, thinks these lawsuits will end up in the Supreme Court. If the courts rule that OpenAI and others are guilty of copyright infringement, \u201cthey\u2019ll need to make a deal with everybody.\u201d\n\nTofel thinks most publishers will end up making deals with AI companies. He noted that Google also faced similar copyright suits back when its search product was taking off, but by the time those were settled, users were so dependent on search that no publisher wanted to keep its content out of it.\n\nMcCarthy says writers can\u2019t rely only on the courts: \u201cWe have to look at every potential avenue as a way to push back against AI implementation.\u201d\n\nAnother concern for journalists is the adoption of AI by publishers for writing content, which some media outlets have already begun experimenting with.\n\nCNET and Gannett have published AI-generated stories and art, and in the case of Sports Illustrated, under fabricated bylines. Those stories were called out as AI-generated mainly because they were riddled with factual errors, but if AI gets a free pass to train on good journalism, those obvious errors may decrease over time.\n\nIf journalists won\u2019t question this, who will?\n\nJournalists understand the basic structure of the deals, but they still have questions.\n\nThe Atlantic\u2019s VP of communications, Anna Bross, said the company\u2019s partnership positions it as a premium news source within OpenAI, similar to other publishers\u2019 deals.\n\n\u201cThe Atlantic\u2019s articles will be discoverable within OpenAI\u2019s products, including ChatGPT, and as a partner, The Atlantic will help to shape how news is surfaced and presented in future real-time discovery products,\u201d Bross told TechCrunch. \u201cThe deal ensures guardrails and protections around how our content does appear within OpenAI\u2019s products. \u2026 If an Atlantic article is surfaced in response to a query, there will be Atlantic branding and a link back to the article on our site.\u201d\n\nBross noted that this is not a syndication license, meaning that OpenAI doesn\u2019t have permission to reproduce The Atlantic\u2019s articles or create similar reproductions of whole articles or lengthy excerpts.\n\nHowever, Atlantic journalists are still waiting on their leadership to explain why such content doesn\u2019t qualify as derivative work, which they would have the chance of being paid directly for. The Atlantic recently launched a new line of paperback books with the collected works of its writers, and it compensated the writers for those works, multiple sources told TechCrunch.\n\nBross noted that The Atlantic\u2019s contract with OpenAI protects against the creation of a derivative work.\n\nThe Atlantic\u2019s editorial staff brought up that topic at an all-hands meeting in mid-June, headed by the publication\u2019s CEO Nick Thompson, and they learned that while ChatGPT will be getting access to their work, the edit team is otherwise \u201cfairly insulated from it.\u201d\n\nIn other words, there\u2019s not an immediate threat of ChatGPT being used to write articles.\n\nThe financial terms of The Atlantic and Vox deals still elude journalists inside and outside the publications, but we know that The Atlantic\u2019s is a two-year contract, and that both will include the use of OpenAI technology for building products and features. OpenAI says that its tech will not be used to mimic writers\u2019 own voices.\n\nNews Corp, The Wall Street Journal\u2019s parent company, has also signed a deal with OpenAI that\u2019s reportedly worth more than $250 million over five years.

{"title": "\u2018What\u2019s in it for us?\u2019 journalists ask as publications sign content deals with AI firms", "text": "Now writers are picking up the pace to put AI protections in contracts\n\nVox Media\u2019s president, Pam Wasserstein, sent her staff a Slack message and an email on May 29 detailing what the company\u2019s journalists say was shocking news: Vox had signed a content licensing deal with OpenAI.\n\nThe deal gives the AI company access to Vox\u2019s current content, as well as the entire archive of its journalistic work, to train ChatGPT and other models. Wasserstein sent the alerts just moments before Axios published an exclusive detailing the licensing and product deal, much to the surprise of her journalists.\n\nWriters at The Atlantic, which signed a similar deal with the Microsoft-backed AI giant, were also sent an email moments before the Axios piece went up.\n\n\u201cAtlantic staffers have largely learned of this agreement from outside sources, and both the company and OpenAI have refused to answer questions about the terms of the deal,\u201d reads a May 30 statement from The Atlantic Union.\n\nNone of the current or former journalists at either company who TechCrunch interviewed had any inkling that their work would be handed over to OpenAI. All of them are concerned that their employers are making short-sighted deals that will ultimately harm writers and journalism as a whole.\n\nBoth Vox Media \u2014 which includes The Verge, New York, Eater, The Cut and more publications \u2014 and The Atlantic have published pieces that are critical of OpenAI and generative AI. They have aired concerns about the environmental impact of the power needed to run large language models, the board upheavals at OpenAI, and the \u201cgeneral lack of trustworthiness\u201d in the company, said Amy McCarthy, a reporter at Eater and communications chair of Vox\u2019s union.\n\nVox did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSince the deals were announced, journalists at each publisher have wrangled meetings with business-side higher-ups to learn more about the agreements, looking for one crucial piece of information: What\u2019s in it for the journalists?\n\nA sense of urgency\n\nIn the face of an increasing number of AI media deals, news guilds are now notching up the pace of negotiations to put in place AI protections similar to the ones Hollywood writing teams fought for.\n\n\u201cThe Writers Guild and Vox Media Union are firmly of the opinion that implementation of AI is a mandatory subject of bargaining, even though our contracts may not explicitly have AI provisions,\u201d McCarthy told TechCrunch. \u201cWe do have provisions in our contract that essentially mean that the company has to bargain with us over fundamental changes to our working conditions, and we very much believe this is a workplace issue, that it\u2019s a working conditions issue, and that the company is obligated to bargain with us about how this will work.\u201d\n\nThis means publishers that strike deals with AI providers might be contractually required to engage in discussions and negotiations with unions about these changes.\n\nThe Atlantic Media Union had also intended to bring this issue to the bargaining table, but the OpenAI deal adds a sense of urgency, one current employee told TechCrunch, requesting anonymity.\n\nDuring negotiations this month, The Atlantic\u2019s union put forward a proposal, per which AI wouldn\u2019t be used to replace writing, fact-checking, copy editing and illustration. It also proposed that writers can use AI at their discretion, in accordance with journalistic principles and ethics, but they can\u2019t be made to use it. That proposal is yet to be accepted.\n\nOther unions are working to put in similar protections. Nebraska journalists at the Omaha World-Herald Guild secured protections from AI earlier this year. In 2023, after CNET published a series of AI-generated articles, journalists at the publication went public with their union drive, demanding AI protections and a say in how AI is implemented in employee workflows.\n\nMaking companies include such safeguards in journalists\u2019 contracts is vital, because protection from the law isn\u2019t guaranteed. Companies like OpenAI contend that they\u2019re not breaking copyright laws by scraping what they say is publicly available content. They also say their chatbots don\u2019t reproduce the material in its entirety.\n\nBut publications like The New York Times, Raw Story, AlterNet and The Intercept have all sued OpenAI for using copyrighted works by journalists to train ChatGPT without properly crediting or citing the sources. Novelists, computer programmers and other groups have also filed copyright suits against OpenAI and other companies building generative AI.\n\nRichard Tofel, former president of nonprofit newsroom ProPublica and a consultant to news outlets, thinks these lawsuits will end up in the Supreme Court. If the courts rule that OpenAI and others are guilty of copyright infringement, \u201cthey\u2019ll need to make a deal with everybody.\u201d\n\nTofel thinks most publishers will end up making deals with AI companies. He noted that Google also faced similar copyright suits back when its search product was taking off, but by the time those were settled, users were so dependent on search that no publisher wanted to keep its content out of it.\n\nMcCarthy says writers can\u2019t rely only on the courts: \u201cWe have to look at every potential avenue as a way to push back against AI implementation.\u201d\n\nAnother concern for journalists is the adoption of AI by publishers for writing content, which some media outlets have already begun experimenting with.\n\nCNET and Gannett have published AI-generated stories and art, and in the case of Sports Illustrated, under fabricated bylines. Those stories were called out as AI-generated mainly because they were riddled with factual errors, but if AI gets a free pass to train on good journalism, those obvious errors may decrease over time.\n\nIf journalists won\u2019t question this, who will?\n\nJournalists understand the basic structure of the deals, but they still have questions.\n\nThe Atlantic\u2019s VP of communications, Anna Bross, said the company\u2019s partnership positions it as a premium news source within OpenAI, similar to other publishers\u2019 deals.\n\n\u201cThe Atlantic\u2019s articles will be discoverable within OpenAI\u2019s products, including ChatGPT, and as a partner, The Atlantic will help to shape how news is surfaced and presented in future real-time discovery products,\u201d Bross told TechCrunch. \u201cThe deal ensures guardrails and protections around how our content does appear within OpenAI\u2019s products. \u2026 If an Atlantic article is surfaced in response to a query, there will be Atlantic branding and a link back to the article on our site.\u201d\n\nBross noted that this is not a syndication license, meaning that OpenAI doesn\u2019t have permission to reproduce The Atlantic\u2019s articles or create similar reproductions of whole articles or lengthy excerpts.\n\nHowever, Atlantic journalists are still waiting on their leadership to explain why such content doesn\u2019t qualify as derivative work, which they would have the chance of being paid directly for.

{"title": "Apple\u2019s App Store breaches EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act", "text": "A few months after opening a non-compliance case on Apple and the Digital Markets Act (DMA), the European Commission has shared its preliminary findings with Apple. And the bottom line is that the current App Store rules are in breach of the DMA. Confirmed violations of the DMA can lead to fines of up to 10% of global annual turnover.\n\n\u201c\u2018Act different\u2019 should be their new slogan,\u201d the EU\u2019s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, wrote on X. \u201cFor too long, Apple has been squeezing out innovative companies \u2014 denying consumers new opportunities & choices.\u201d\n\nIn this particular case, the European Commission believes third-party developers should be able to inform customers of alternative purchasing possibilities \u2014 free of charge.\n\nFor instance, developers who have released apps on the App Store can\u2019t advertise different prices or alternative distribution channels in their apps. While Apple now allows developers to include a link to their site, the European Commission believes there are too many restrictions with this link-out mechanism.\n\nEven if developers redirect users to their websites and handle transactions on their websites, they have to report transactions to Apple and pay a commission. Apple only waives a 3% payment processing fee for web purchases.\n\n\u201cApple has made a number of changes to comply with the DMA in response to feedback from developers and the European Commission,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe are confident our plan complies with the law, and estimate more than 99% of developers would pay the same or less in fees to Apple under the new business terms we created.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these preliminary findings, the European Commission is opening a third non-compliance investigation into Apple\u2019s new contractual terms for EU developers. This time, the Commission is going to focus on Apple\u2019s controversial Core Technology Fee (CTF) and alternative app marketplaces.\n\nEuropean developers can remain on the standard business terms or choose new business terms that allow them to distribute their apps outside of the App Store. However, these new terms lead to a \u20ac0.50 fee per installed app after one million downloads.\n\nThe company has already adjusted the CTF so that it doesn\u2019t apply to free non-commercial apps. There\u2019s also a three-year transition period for small developers that release a hit app and get more than one million downloads for the first time. But that doesn\u2019t change much in the long term. With this new formal investigation, the EC will determine whether the CTF effectively complies with the DMA.\n\nIf you\u2019ve tried to install a third-party app store in the EU, such as the AltStore, Setapp Mobile or Aptoide, you may have noticed that it requires quite a few taps. You first get an error in your web browser. You have to open the Settings app, accept app installations from this site, go back to your web browser, download the alternative store again, and accept popups about the risks involved with a third-party app store. The EC will examine this \u201cmulti-step user journey\u201d and its compliance with the DMA rules.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that Apple designed its new business model to discourage app developers and end users from taking advantage of the opportunities afforded to them by the DMA,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, the Commission EVP in charge of competition policy, said in a speech.\n\n\u201cThe letter of the DMA is clear: Gatekeepers have to allow for alternative app stores to establish themselves on their platform, and for consumers to be fully informed about the offers available to them so that they can freely choose where they want to source their apps, and at what conditions,\u201d she added.\n\nAs for today\u2019s preliminary findings, Apple can now respond to the European Commission in writing. The final decision is due one year after the opening of the formal investigation, which means that Apple can negotiate with the EU and adjust its business terms once again to avoid a hefty fine.", "authors": "['Romain Dillet']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2112138706.jpg?resize=1200,795", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/24/apples-app-store-breaches-eus-digital-markets-act/", "timestamp": "1719367116.554581", "displayed": 0}
{"title": "Silicon Valley leaders are once again declaring \u2018DEI\u2019 bad and \u2018meritocracy\u2019 good \u2014 but they\u2019re wrong", "text": "No, Silicon Valley, a \u2018meritocracy\u2019 is not better than DEI, according to the data\n\nWho\u2019s afraid of the Big Bad DEI? The acronym is near-poisonous now \u2014 a word that creates almost instant tension between those who embrace it and those who want it dead.\n\nA prime example of this divide was the response to startup Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang\u2019s post on X last week. He wrote about moving away from DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) to instead embrace \u201cMEI\u201d \u2014 merit, excellence, and intelligence.\n\n\u201cScale is a meritocracy, and we must always remain one,\u201d Wang wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal whenever we invite someone to join our mission, and those decisions have never been swayed by orthodoxy or virtue signaling or whatever the current thing is.\u201d\n\nToday we\u2019ve formalized an important hiring policy at Scale. We hire for MEI: merit, excellence, and intelligence.\n\n\n\nThis is the email I\u2019ve shared with our @scale_AI team.\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\nMERITOCRACY AT SCALE\n\n\n\nIn the wake of our fundraise, I\u2019ve been getting a lot of questions\u2026 \u2014 Alexandr Wang (@alexandr_wang) June 13, 2024\n\nThe commenters on X \u2014 which included Elon Musk, Palmer Luckey, and Brian Armstrong \u2014 were thrilled. On LinkedIn, however, the startup community gave a less-than-enthusiastic response. Those commenters pointed out that Wang\u2019s post made it seem as if \u201cmeritocracy\u201d was the definitive benchmark to find qualified hiring candidates \u2014 without taking into consideration that the idea of meritocracy is itself subjective. In the days that have followed the post, more and more people have shared their thoughts and what Wang\u2019s comments reveal about the current state of DEI in tech.\n\n\u201cThe post is misguided because people who support the meritocracy argument are ignoring the structural reasons some groups are more likely to outperform others,\u201d Mutale Nkonde, a founder working in AI policy, told TechCrunch. \u201dWe all want the best people for the job, and there is data to prove that diverse teams are more effective.\u201d\n\nEmily Witko, an HR professional at AI startup Hugging Face, told TechCrunch that the post was a \u201cdangerous oversimplification,\u201d but that it received so much attention on X because it \u201copenly expressed sentiments that are not always expressed publicly and the audience there is hungry to attack DEI.\u201d Wang\u2019s MEI thought \u201cmakes it so easy to refute or criticize any conversations regarding the importance of acknowledging underrepresentation in tech,\u201d she continued.\n\nBut Wang is far from the only Silicon Valley insider to attack DEI in recent months. He joins a chorus of those who feel that DEI programs implemented at businesses over the past several years, peaking with the Black Lives Matter movement, caused a backslide in corporate profitability \u2014 and that a return to \u201cmeritocratic principles\u201d is overdue. Indeed, much of the tech industry has worked to dismantle recruitment programs that considered candidates who, under previous hiring regimes, were often overlooked in the hiring process.\n\nSeeking to make a change, in 2020, many organizations and power players came together to promise more of a focus on DEI, which, contrary to the mainstream discussion, is not simply about hiring someone based on the color of their skin but is about ensuring qualified people from all walks of life \u2014 regardless of skin, gender, or ethnic background \u2014 are better represented and included in recruitment funnels. It\u2019s also about taking a look at disparities and pipeline issues, analyzing the reasoning behind why certain candidates are constantly overlooked in a hiring process.\n\nIn 2023, the U.S. data industry saw new women recruit levels drop by two-thirds, from 36% in 2022 to just 12%, according to a report from HR staffing firm Harnham. Meanwhile, the percentage of Black, Indigenous, and professionals of color in VP or above data roles stood at just 38% in 2022.\n\nAlexandr Wang (pictured above) caused a stir on social media when he posted about meritocracy in tech on X. Image Credits: Drew Angerer / Staff / Getty Images\n\nDEI-related job listings have also fallen out of favor, declining 44% in 2023, according to data from the job site Indeed. In the AI industry, a recent Deloitte survey of women found that over half said they ended up leaving at least one employer because of how men and women were treated differently, while 73% considered leaving the tech industry altogether due to unequal pay and an inability to advance in their careers.\n\nYet, for an industry that prides itself on being data-driven, Silicon Valley cannot let the idea of a meritocracy go \u2014 despite all the data and research showing how such thinking is just a belief system and one that can lead to biased outcomes. The idea of going out and hiring \u201cthe best person for the job\u201d without taking into account any human sociology is how pattern-matching occurs \u2014 teams and companies of people who are alike, when the research has long shown that more diverse teams perform better. Moreover, it has only raised suspicions about who the Valley considers excellent and why.\n\nExperts we spoke to said this subjectiveness revealed other issues with Wang\u2019s missive \u2014 mostly that he presents MEI as a revolutionary idea and not one that Silicon Valley and most of corporate America have long embraced. The acronym \u201cMEI\u201d appears to be a scornful nod to DEI, intended to drive home the notion that a company must choose between hiring diverse candidates or candidates that meet certain \u201cobjective\u201d qualifications.\n\nNatalie Sue Johnson, co-founder of the DEI consulting firm Paradigm, told TechCrunch that research has shown meritocracy to be a paradox and that organizations that focus too much on it actually see an increase in bias. \u201cIt frees people up from thinking that they have to try hard to be fair in their decision-making,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey think that meritocracy is inherent, not something that needs to be achieved.\u201d\n\nAs Nkonde mentioned, Johnson noted that Wang\u2019s approach doesn\u2019t acknowledge that underrepresented groups face systemic barriers society is still struggling to address. Ironically, the most meritorious person could be the one who has achieved a skill set for a job despite such barriers that may have influenced their educational background or prevented them from filling their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with the kind of college internships that impresses Silicon Valley.\n\nTreating a person as a faceless, nameless candidate, without understanding their unique experiences, and therefore their employability, is a mistake, Johnson said. \u201cThere is nuance.\u201d\n\nWitko added to that: \u201cA meritocratic system is built on criteria that reflect the status quo, and therefore, it will perpetuate existing inequalities by continuously favoring those who already have advantages.\u201d\n\nTo be somewhat charitable to Wang, given how acidic the term DEI has become, developing a new term that still represents the value of fairness to all candidates, isn\u2019t a terrible idea \u2014 even if \u201cmeritocracy\u201d is misguided. And his post suggests that Scale AI\u2019s values could align with the spirit of diversity, equity, and inclusion even if he might not realize it, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cCasting a wide net for talent and making objective hiring decisions that do not disadvantage candidates based on identity is exactly what diversity, equity, and inclusion work seeks to do,\u201d she explained.\n\nBut again, where Wang undermines this is endorsing the mistaken belief that meritocracy will produce outcomes based on one\u2019s abilities and merits alone.\n\nPerhaps it is all a paradox. If one looks at Scale AI\u2019s treatment of its data annotators \u2014 many of whom live in economically depressed countries and scrape by on little pay \u2014 it suggests the company has scant real interest in disrupting the status quo.\n\nScale AI\u2019s annotators work on tasks for multiple eight-hour workdays \u2014 no breaks \u2014 for pay ranging as low as $10 (per the Verge and NY Mag). It\u2019s on the backs of these annotators that Scale AI has built a business worth over $13 billion and with more than $1.6 billion in cash in the bank.\n\nWhen asked for comment on the allegations made in the Verge and NY Mag piece, a spokesperson pointed to this blog post, in which it described its human annotator jobs as \u201cgig work.\u201d The spokesperson didn\u2019t address TechCrunch\u2019s request for clarification on Scale AI\u2019s MEI policy.\n\nJohnson said Wang\u2019s post is a great example of the box many leaders and companies find themselves trapped in.\n\nShe pondered, can they trust that having meritocratic ideals is enough to lead to truly meritocratic outcomes, and promote diversity?\n\n\u201cOr,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cdo they acknowledge that ideals are not enough, and to truly build more diverse workforces where everyone has the same access to opportunities and can do their best work requires intention?\u201d", "authors": "['Dominic-Madori Davis', 'Kyle Wiggers']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DEI-big-bad-wolf.jpg?resize=1200,645", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/23/silicon-valley-leaders-are-once-again-declaring-dei-bad-and-meritocracy-good-but-theyre-wrong/", "timestamp": "1719367118.17209", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "iOS 18 could \u2018sherlock\u2019 $400M in app revenue", "text": "Apple\u2019s practice of leveraging ideas from its third-party developer community to become new iOS and Mac features and apps has a hefty price tag, a new report indicates. With the release of iOS 18 later this fall, Apple\u2019s changes may affect apps that today have an estimated $393 million in revenue and have been downloaded roughly 58 million times over the past year, according to an analysis by app intelligence firm Appfigures.\n\nEvery June at Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference, the iPhone maker teases the upcoming releases of its software and operating systems, which often include features previously only available through third-party apps. The practice is so common now it\u2019s even been given a name: \u201csherlocking\u201d \u2014 a reference to a 1990s search app for Mac that borrowed features from a third-party app known as Watson. Now when Apple launches a new feature that was before the domain of a third-party app, it\u2019s said to have \u201csherlocked\u201d the app.\n\nIn earlier years, sherlocking apps made some sense. After all, did the iPhone\u2019s flashlight really need to be a third-party offering, or would it be better as a built-in function? Plus, Apple has been able to launch features that made its software better adapted to consumers\u2019 wants and needs by looking at what\u2019s popular among the third-party developer community.\n\nOf course, this practice also raises the question as to whether Apple is leveraging proprietary data to make its determinations about what to build next, and whether the apps it competes with are being offered an even playing field. For example, before Apple launched its own parental controls system, it shut down many third-party apps that had built businesses in this space by saying their solutions were now noncompliant with its rules and policies. The apps weren\u2019t offered access to a developer API for managing Apple\u2019s built-in parental controls for years, prompting an antitrust investigation.\n\nIn more recent years, Apple has \u201csherlocked\u201d third parties with launches of features like Continuity Camera, medication tracking, sleep tracking and mood tracking, as well as apps like Freeform and Journal. This year, it turned its attention to password managers, call recording and transcription apps, those for making custom emoji, AI-powered writing tools and math helpers, trail apps and more.\n\nIn an analysis of third-party apps that generated more than 1,000 downloads per year, Appfigures discovered several genres that had found themselves in Apple\u2019s crosshairs in 2024.\n\nIn terms of worldwide gross revenue, these categories have generated significant income over the past 12 months, with the trail app category making the most at $307 million per year, led by market leader and 2023 Apple \u201cApp of the Year\u201d AllTrails. Grammar helper apps, like Grammarly and others, also generated $35.7 million, while math helpers and password managers earned $23.4 million and $20.3 million, respectively. Apps for making custom emoji generated $7 million, too.\n\nImage Credits: Appfigures\n\nOf these, trail apps accounted for the vast majority of \u201cpotentially sherlocked\u201d revenue, or 78%, noted Appfigures, as well as 40% of downloads of sherlocked apps. In May 2024, they accounted for an estimated $28.8 million in gross consumer spending and 2.5 million downloads, to give you an idea of scale.\n\nMany of these app categories were growing quickly, with math solvers having seen revenue growth of 43% year-over-year followed by grammar helpers (+40%), password managers (+38%) and trail apps (+28%). Emoji-making apps, however, were seeing declines at -17% year-over-year.\n\nImage Credits: Appfigures\n\nBy downloads, grammar helpers had seen 9.4 million installs over the past 12 months, followed by emoji makers (10.6 million), math-solving apps (9.5 million) and password managers (457,000 installs).\n\nAlthough these apps certainly have dedicated user bases that may not immediately choose to switch to a first-party offering, Apple\u2019s ability to offer similar functionality built-in could be detrimental to their potential growth. Casual users may be satisfied by Apple\u2019s \u201cgood enough\u201d solutions and won\u2019t seek out alternatives.\n\nHowever, apps that continue to develop new features and add enhancements beyond what Apple includes while also taking advantage of other new ways to reach users, like through Apple\u2019s improved Siri, may have a better shot than others.", "authors": "['Sarah Perez']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/app-store-2024-v1.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/18/ios-18-could-sherlock-400m-in-app-revenue/", "timestamp": "1719367122.19548", "displayed": 0}

How does it work?\n\nChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.\n\nWhen did ChatGPT get released?\n\nNovember 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.\n\nWhat is the latest version of ChatGPT?\n\nBoth the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.\n\nCan I use ChatGPT for free?\n\nThere is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.\n\nWho uses ChatGPT?\n\nAnyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.\n\nWhat companies use ChatGPT?\n\nMultiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.\n\nMost recently, Microsoft announced at it\u2019s 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.\n\nWhat does GPT mean in ChatGPT?\n\nGPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.\n\nWhat is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?\n\nA chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they\u2019ll give canned responses to questions.\n\nChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.\n\nCan ChatGPT write essays?\n\nYes.\n\nCan ChatGPT commit libel?\n\nDue to the nature of how these models work, they don\u2019t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That\u2019s a problem when you\u2019re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn\u2019t commit, that may well at this point be libel.\n\nWe will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.\n\nDoes ChatGPT have an app?\n\nYes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.\n\nWhat is the ChatGPT character limit?\n\nIt\u2019s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.\n\nDoes ChatGPT have an API?\n\nYes, it was released March 1, 2023.\n\nWhat are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?\n\nEveryday examples include programing, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.\n\nWhat are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?\n\nAdvanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.\n\nHow good is ChatGPT at writing code?\n\nIt depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can\u2019t necessarily program an entire app\u2019s worth of code. That\u2019s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness \u2014 in other words, the generated code isn\u2019t always appropriate for the specific context in which it\u2019s being used.\n\nCan you save a ChatGPT chat?\n\nYes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.\n\nAre there alternatives to ChatGPT?\n\nYes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google\u2019s Gemini and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.\n\nHow does ChatGPT handle data privacy?\n\nOpenAI has said that individuals in \u201ccertain jurisdictions\u201d (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression \u201cin accordance with applicable laws\u201d.\n\nThe web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled \u201cOpenAI Personal Data Removal Request\u201d.\n\nIn its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on \u201clegitimate interest\u201d (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out \u2014 when it writes: \u201cSee here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.\u201d\n\nWhat controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?\n\nRecently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI\u2019s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.\n\nAn Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT\u2019s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.\n\nCNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.\n\nSeveral major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.\n\nThere have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.\n\nWhere can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?\n\nSeveral marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.\n\nCan ChatGPT be detected?\n\nPoorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they\u2019re inconsistent at best.\n\nAre ChatGPT chats public?\n\nNo. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users\u2019 conversations to other people on the service.\n\nWhat lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?\n\nNone specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.\n\nAre there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?\n\nYes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.", "authors": "['Kyle Wiggers', 'Cody Corrall', 'Alyssa Stringer']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1462188043.jpg?resize=1200,798", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/17/chatgpt-everything-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot/", "timestamp": "1719367130.933547", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "10 of the most exciting digital health startups of 2024, according to VCs", "text": "In the post-COVID world, VCs say it\u2019s not as easy to get excited about investing in digital health. Deal activity in healthcare IT was relatively flat in Q1 2024 at 74 total deals, valued at about $1 billion total, up only 3% from the year-ago quarter, according to PitchBook data.\n\nStill, promising startups have grabbed investors\u2019 attention this year. TechCrunch spoke with about a dozen healthcare VCs about the companies they think have the most promising future. While recently formed AI-driven startups that are solving staggering administrative challenges in the U.S. healthcare system dominated their recommendations, they also mentioned several slightly older, non-AI-focused businesses.\n\nWe narrowed their suggestions to the list of names that more than one VC mentioned, which came in at an even 10 companies. VCs discussed with us the companies that were both in their portfolios and not.\n\nAbridge\n\nWhat it does: Uses AI to automate medical records based on conversations between doctors and patients.\n\nFounded in 2018 by Shiv Rao, a practicing cardiologist, Abridge is an early entrant into the medical note-taking space and one that has secured integration with the all-powerful Epic Systems health records software.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: The Pittsburgh-based startup generates excitement among investors and hospital systems eager to free up physicians\u2019 time spent on note-taking. Abridge is the health tech startup that among investors we talked to was mentioned the most.\n\nSome investors said that Abridge is leading its category. Other companies competing to dominate the AI-powered medical note-taking market include Ambience, Nabla, Microsoft-owned Nuance and Suki.\n\nFunding: In February, Abridge raised a $150 million Series C led by Lightspeed Ventures at a valuation of $850 million, a mere four months after the virtual medical scribe startup grabbed a $30 million Series B from Spark Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners, CVS Health Ventures and others.\n\nCodaMetrix\n\nWhat it does: Founded in 2019, CodaMetrix uses AI to automate medical coding. The company\u2019s technology translates medical notes stored in electronic health records into diagnostic codes, helping to reduce errors and administrative burdens.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Medical coding is tedious and error-prone. Entering an incorrect code for a condition or treatment can lead to insurance rejection of claims and other administrative problems. Moreover, the burden of entering codes falls on already busy physicians and nurses, leading to increased stress and burnout.\n\nThe company has competitors, including Fathom Health, but investors say that CodaMetrix has one of the largest annotated coding datasets.\n\nFunding and valuation: In March, CodaMetrix grabbed a $40 million Series B from Transformation Capital with participation of returning investors SignalFire and Cressey Ventures. The deal valued the Boston-based company at $220 million, according to PitchBook.\n\nCohere Health\n\nWhat it does: Cohere Health expedites health insurance approval process, known as prior authorization, for medical conditions with the help of AI.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Prior authorization management could take medical and administrative staff hours as it requires gathering appropriate documentation for submission to health insurers or Medicaid. Cohere Health\u2019s AI can reduce the time it takes to do this to minutes, saving medical and administrative staff hours on these tasks.\n\nInvestors say that Cohere is for now the leader in the space, but other startups that expedite health insurance approval for medical conditions include Anterior and Alaffia Health.\n\nFunding: Cohere Health raised a $50 million Series B earlier this year from Deerfield Management with participation from Define Ventures, Polaris Partners, Longitude Capital and Flare Capital Partners.\n\nGrow Therapy\n\nWhat it does: Grow Therapy connects therapists who want to start independent practices with patients and insurers. Founded in 2020, the startup employs the so-called business-in-box model because it gives mental health professionals tools for filing claims, receiving payments and being matched with patients.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: The company claims that its business model offers therapists more flexibility than if they were to provide their services through marketplaces like Headway or Lyra. While it\u2019s not clear whether that\u2019s indeed the case, Grow, true to its name, is growing fast, investors say.\n\nFunding and valaution: In April, Grow closed an $88 million Series C led by Sequoia at a $1.4 billion valuation, according to PitchBook data.\n\nEquip\n\nWhat it does: Four-year-old Equip provides online treatment for kids, teens and adults in all 50 states and accepts most health insurances. Equip providers are also trained to address co-occurring conditions like anxiety, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: About 10% of the U.S. population develops an eating disorder during their lives, but only a fraction of these people receive help, according to the National Eating Disorders Association. The company\u2019s offering brings care to those who don\u2019t live near an eating disorder facility or prefer to be treated online.\n\nFunding and valuation: Equip was last valued at $505 million and has secured a total of $135 million in funding from investors, including Optum Ventures and General Catalyst, according to PitchBook data.\n\nMaven\n\nWhat it does: The New York-based health clinic and benefits platform offers services for fertility, adoption, parenting, pediatrics and menopause through employers, including Microsoft and AT&T. Maven also serves Medicaid patients.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Investors say that 10-year-old Maven continues to grow, given that its area of focus \u2014 digital health services for women and families \u2014 has been historically underserved. While VC interest in women\u2019s health has grown in recent years, the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022 has shined an even brighter spotlight on the need for technologies that serve the female population.\n\nFunding and valuation: Since its founding, Maven has raised nearly $300 million in funding and was last valued in late 2022 at $1.35 billion in a Series E round led by General Catalyst with the participation of VCs, including Lux Capital, Oak HC/FT and Sequoia.\n\nMemora Health\n\nWhat it does: Memora Health offers virtual AI-based care coordination, reducing administrative burdens for medical staff. The company\u2019s technology uses text messages to communicate with patients, automating tasks like appointment reminders, answering patients\u2019 common questions and collecting data about symptoms and post-procedure recovery.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Like many other AI-based healthcare startups, Memora saves medical staff time. The company also helps patients feel more supported on their health journey.\n\nFunding: The company spun out of Harvard Innovation Lab and went through Y Combinator in 2018. Since then, it has raised nearly $80 million and was valued in April 2023 at $430 million, according to PitchBook data. Memora\u2019s investors include General Catalyst and Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nSmarterDx\n\nWhat it does: Founded in 2020, SmarterDx uses AI to help hospitals not miss out on revenues by analyzing patients\u2019 lab results, medications and doctors\u2019 notes to find minor errors and omissions in patients\u2019 diagnoses and associated medical codes. The company\u2019s technology reviews patient charts for accuracy before a claim is sent to health insurance or Medicare.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Investors say that since Smarter Dx helps health systems realize more revenues, the value of the company\u2019s technology is easy to measure.\n\nFunding: In May, SmarterDx raised a $50 million Series B round led by Transformation Capital, with participation from Bessemer Venture Partners, Flare Capital Partners and Floodgate Fund. The latest capital infusion brought the company\u2019s total funding to $71 million.\n\nSummer Health\n\nWhat it does: The two-year-old Summer Health connects parents to pediatricians who, within minutes, respond to urgent care and behavioral concerns. The company provides its text messaging service directly to consumers and through employers who offer access to Summer Health as a benefit.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Busy and worried parents want answers to their children\u2019s health issues right away and around the clock. Summer Health reduces parents\u2019 concerns because they can get fast responses to their questions via an app.\n\nFunding: In April, Summer Health raised its $12 million Series A led by 7wireVentures and existing investors including Sequoia, Lux Capital and Chelsea Clinton\u2019s Metrodora Ventures.\n\nTranscarent\n\nWhat it does: Four-year-old Transcarent helps large companies save money on providing health insurance to employees. The startup gives employees access to discounted medications, telehealth services and personalized AI-generated answers about their health coverage.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Part of the company\u2019s fast rise could be attributed to its founder, Glen Tullman, who previously started Livongo, a chronic condition management company Teledoc acquired for $18.5 billion in 2020.\n\nThe company also recently introduced an AI platform that answers members\u2019 questions about coverage, offers clinical information and connects them with medical staff as needed.\n\nFunding and valuation: In May, the company raised a $450 million Series D at a $2.2 billion valuation led by General Catalyst and 7wireVentures.", "authors": "['Marina Temkin']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-927809262.jpg?resize=1200,600", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/10-of-the-most-exciting-digital-health-startups-of-2024-according-to-vcs/", "timestamp": "1719367156.161336", "displayed": 0}

Summer Health reduces parents\u2019 concerns because they can get fast responses to their questions via an app.\n\nFunding: In April, Summer Health raised its $12 million Series A led by 7wireVentures and existing investors including Sequoia, Lux Capital and Chelsea Clinton\u2019s Metrodora Ventures.\n\nTranscarent\n\nWhat it does: Four-year-old Transcarent helps large companies save money on providing health insurance to employees. The startup gives employees access to discounted medications, telehealth services and personalized AI-generated answers about their health coverage.\n\nWhy it\u2019s promising: Part of the company\u2019s fast rise could be attributed to its founder, Glen Tullman, who previously started Livongo, a chronic condition management company Teledoc acquired for $18.5 billion in 2020.\n\nThe company also recently introduced an AI platform that answers members\u2019 questions about coverage, offers clinical information and connects them with medical staff as needed.\n\nFunding and valuation: In May, the company raised a $450 million Series D at a $2.2 billion valuation led by General Catalyst and 7wireVentures.", "authors": "['Marina Temkin']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-927809262.jpg?resize=1200,600", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/10-of-the-most-exciting-digital-health-startups-of-2024-according-to-vcs/", "timestamp": "1719367160.317583", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "Fearless Fund\u2019s founder has resigned, and it\u2019s a sad reflection on the VC world for Black women", "text": "On Monday, Fearless Fund\u2019s co-founder Ayana Parsons announced that she was stepping down from her leadership role from the firm. She will no longer be its general partner and COO but will be off \u201cenjoying island life\u201d with her family, she said in a LinkedIn post. She co-founded the fund in 2019 with partner Arian Simone, who remains its CEO.\n\nFearless Fund was founded with a mission to provide venture capital financing, grants and financial education to startups founded by Black women. That\u2019s a demographic that is both particularly underserved and promising. Less than 1% of all VC dollars in 2023 went to Black-founded startups, which amounts to around $661 million out of $136 billion, according to Crunchbase data.\n\nSo Fearless Fund is doing exactly what venture capitalists are supposed to do: find an overlooked area (in Silicon Valley they might call it taking a \u201ccontrarian view\u201d) and invest. The fund has so far invested $26 million into over 40 companies that include Slutty Vegan, The Lip Bar, Partake Foods, and Live Tinted, Atlanta Daily World reports.\n\nThe money invested and granted is from private limited partners. The LPs who supported the fund want to support this thesis. The companies receiving money are still private startups. Since so little classic VC funding is going to these businesses, the community is building their own rails. Everyone in this ecosystem is OK with this.\n\nStill, it is being sued by a politically conservative group called the American Alliance for Equal Rights (AAER) over its charitable grants program. AAER is challenging the fund\u2019s right to provide $20,000 in small business grants to Black women, claiming the program violates the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which bans the use of race in contracts.\n\nAAER was founded by Edward Blum, an activist who helped successfully overturn affirmative action in universities and is now conducting several other lawsuits in similar veins (e.g., the AAER is currently suing the Smithsonian Institute\u2019s Latino Museum Studies Program for hiring Latino interns).\n\nThe case is not going particularly well for Fearless Fund. As TechCrunch recently reported, earlier this month an appeals court ruled against Fearless. It upheld a preliminary injunction that prevents the firm from making grants to Black women business owners. The firm told TechCrunch at that time it is weighing its options on how to proceed.\n\nLast year, when the case made national news, numerous founders and investors told TechCrunch about the infuriating irony of using the Civil Rights Act of 1866 to protest the firm\u2019s program, as it was initially put into place to help the formerly enslaved and is now being used against the community it sought to help.\n\nIn the months that followed, the frustration of this case within the community has not lessened. Earlier on Monday, Parsons had an emotional moment onstage at the ForbesBLK Summit in Atlanta. She was joined by political leader Stacey Abrams and the chief diversity officer of Congress, Dr. Sesha Joi Moon.\n\n\u201cAnytime you are surrounded by Black women, they are going to pour into you,\u2019\u2019 Parsons said, according to Forbes. \u201cSo, when I walked on this stage, these eyes were watering because they understood the heavy burden that is on all of us in this country.\u2019\u2019\n\nAfter announcing her resignation, Parsons told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and her spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the lawsuit against Fearless was not a motivating factor. But she did not otherwise explain her decision to leave. She also remains an investor in the fund. \u201cAs co-founder, Ayana is still an investor and she has always had multiple ventures centered around inclusion leadership and development, venture capital, and entrepreneurship. Fearless Fund is merely one avenue in her pursuit to be an advocate for the marginalized,\u201d her spokesperson said.\n\nParsons said in her LinkedIn post that she founded the firm \u201cto help change the game for women of color entrepreneurs. And my rationale was simple: women of color are the most founded yet the least funded. They are starting businesses at a faster rate than any other demographic yet lack access to the capital, resources, education and networks needed to scale their businesses.\u201d\n\nShe also promised not to give up on her goal. \u201cI remain steadfast in my support of and commitment to the advancement of women of color,\u201d she said in an emailed statement, mentioning that she\u2019ll soon be publishing a book, too.\n\nStill, as we previously pointed out, the sad fact is that big names in the tech ecosystem have not exactly come out swinging in support. CEO Simone told Inc. earlier this year that the fund had lost nearly all its partnerships aside from two, JPMorgan and Costco. Even Mastercard, who sponsored the now-contested Strivers Grant, has publicly never commented on the lawsuit.\n\nIndeed, support for anything considered DEI has done a complete pendulum swing in tech in 2024, from its height in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd.

Meanwhile, the company was on the hook for $99 million a year for cloud infrastructure rentals from AWS, Google Cloud and CoreWeave to train and run its models and $53 million in operating expenses and wages.\n\nBy December, Stability had pivoted to a subscription model for commercial use of its technology with prices starting at $20 per month.

{"title": "Notion Sites takes Notion sites up a level", "text": "Popular productivity tool Notion has long allowed its users to make any of their pages public. Now, the company is expanding on this with the launch of Notion Sites, which adds several new features to its existing publishing tools. For the most part, these are pretty straightforward, but together, they do make for a more polished publishing experience.\n\nA lot of content-centric work already happens in Notion, be that organizing publishing calendars or actually working on documents. Over the years, Notion users figured out all kinds of ways to turn their pages into websites \u2014 and some startups were even founded solely on that idea. Given that there\u2019s a clear demand, it makes sense then for the company to lean into publishing that work directly.\n\nImage Credits: Notion\n\n\u201cOne of the best features of Notion has always been that with a single click, you can turn a Notion page into a publicly facing website,\u201d Notion product lead Matt Piccolella told me ahead of today\u2019s launch. \u201cThe problem with these pages is that they\u2019ve always been missing many of the bells and whistles that you might expect to see on a website.\u201d\n\nNotion Sites adds some of those bells and whistles. Specifically, that means the ability to do things like customizing favicons and building navigation bars with links, as well as using breadcrumb navigation. These Notion Sites can now also easily be published under custom domains and, for better visibility and analytics, there are also basic SEO features (mostly title and description) as well as a Google Analytics integration. Notion users can now also customize their share previews to define how a site is represented on social media. And for finding information on the sites themselves, Notion has added a search feature.\n\nLike before, the idea here is to help users publish any Notion page they may have been working on internally and then make those publicly available.

{"title": "Notion Sites takes Notion sites up a level", "text": "Popular productivity tool Notion has long allowed its users to make any of their pages public. Now, the company is expanding on this with the launch of Notion Sites, which adds several new features to its existing publishing tools. For the most part, these are pretty straightforward, but together, they do make for a more polished publishing experience.\n\nA lot of content-centric work already happens in Notion, be that organizing publishing calendars or actually working on documents. Over the years, Notion users figured out all kinds of ways to turn their pages into websites \u2014 and some startups were even founded solely on that idea. Given that there\u2019s a clear demand, it makes sense then for the company to lean into publishing that work directly.\n\nImage Credits: Notion\n\n\u201cOne of the best features of Notion has always been that with a single click, you can turn a Notion page into a publicly facing website,\u201d Notion product lead Matt Piccolella told me ahead of today\u2019s launch. \u201cThe problem with these pages is that they\u2019ve always been missing many of the bells and whistles that you might expect to see on a website.\u201d\n\nNotion Sites adds some of those bells and whistles. Specifically, that means the ability to do things like customizing favicons and building navigation bars with links, as well as using breadcrumb navigation. These Notion Sites can now also easily be published under custom domains and, for better visibility and analytics, there are also basic SEO features (mostly title and description) as well as a Google Analytics integration. Notion users can now also customize their share previews to define how a site is represented on social media. And for finding information on the sites themselves, Notion has added a search feature.\n\nLike before, the idea here is to help users publish any Notion page they may have been working on internally and then make those publicly available. That also means that virtually every existing Notion feature will appear on the public Notion Site, too.\n\nImage Credits: Notion\n\nOne thing the team has very specifically stayed away from, though, is the ability to customize sites in detail.

{"title": "Smashing, from Goodreads\u2019 co-founder, curates the best of the web using AI and human recommendations", "text": "Goodreads\u2018 co-founder Otis Chandler is back to build the next big app community. But this time, his focus isn\u2019t on books; it\u2019s on the content you can find online, including news articles, blog posts, social media posts, podcasts and more. With Smashing, an AI and community-powered content recommendation app, now launching into an invite-only beta, the goal is to help connect users to their interests by surfacing the internet\u2019s hidden gems.\n\nThe launch comes at a time when many news consumers are still lamenting the loss of Artifact, the AI news reader from Instagram\u2019s co-founder that recently sold to TechCrunch parent Yahoo.\n\nAt the same time, the media ecosystem is becoming more fragmented than ever with journalists establishing their own newsletters and Substacks. Twitter, once a hot spot for finding the latest breaking news, has morphed into a more right-leaning app \u201cX,\u201d whose existence has prompted a host of new competitors. In addition, changes at Google and Meta have resulted in a sizable drop in traffic to online publishers, leading to widespread media layoffs. And with AI, the situation looks like it may worsen, as apps and Google begin offering AI summaries of news, potentially losing publishers even more clicks.\n\nChandler believes Smashing can address many of these problems by not only surfacing the articles and posts that are worth people\u2019s time but also encouraging users to visit the publishers\u2019 sites to read more.\n\n\u201cI named Goodreads \u2018Goodreads\u2019 and not \u2018Goodbooks\u2019 because I one day hoped to add articles,\u201d Chandler said. As it turned out, \u201cbooks\u201d was a large enough category on its own to sustain the app, which sold to Amazon in 2013. Chandler continued to work there until five years ago.\n\nImage Credits: Smashing\n\nThe Smashing CEO says he always had an \u201citch to scratch around the rest of the content on the web, which is not just articles.\u201d It\u2019s podcasts, blogs, news articles, tweets, social media posts and YouTube videos, he says. \u201cAny interesting content.\u201d\n\nImage Credits: Smashing\n\nWhat prompted him to start building Smashing, however, was an experience he had during his sabbatical from work following his departure from Amazon. After a month or two of downtime, Chandler decided to challenge himself by entering a Half Ironman triathlon.\n\n\u201cThat led me down a journey of, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve got to learn about training and bicycling, and how to stay in shape and not burn my legs out, and how to eat right for nutrition, how to, therefore, cook better, because I didn\u2019t know how to cook before that,\u201d he said. But, when trying to use a traditional search engine, it was hard to find the best content. \u201cIf you just Google, \u2018how to train for a Half Ironman Triathlon\u2019 or \u2018how to eat healthy,\u2019 you get a lot of content. But it\u2019s not the content you\u2019re really looking for. It\u2019s a lot of SEO-optimized, ad-stuffed pages.\u201d\n\nTo try to find the content he wanted, Chandler tried news aggregators, like Apple News and Google News, Reddit, Twitter, social media and other smaller and medium-sized apps.\n\n\u201cI tried everything I could find, and I was really dissatisfied with the answers I got. I couldn\u2019t find anything I could dial to give me just good, interesting, accurate content. And that led me to the thesis for Smashing,\u201d Chandler said.\n\nHe then teamed up in 2022 with a former co-worker, Greg Veen, now a Smashing co-founder, whose tech background includes founding Measure Map, which sold to Google, and Typekit, which exited to Adobe.\n\nFrom user research, they found that people generally had five or six main interests they\u2019d follow online, including a few related to work and a few that were personal interests.

{"title": "Smashing, from Goodreads\u2019 co-founder, curates the best of the web using AI and human recommendations", "text": "Goodreads\u2018 co-founder Otis Chandler is back to build the next big app community. But this time, his focus isn\u2019t on books; it\u2019s on the content you can find online, including news articles, blog posts, social media posts, podcasts and more. With Smashing, an AI and community-powered content recommendation app, now launching into an invite-only beta, the goal is to help connect users to their interests by surfacing the internet\u2019s hidden gems.\n\nThe launch comes at a time when many news consumers are still lamenting the loss of Artifact, the AI news reader from Instagram\u2019s co-founder that recently sold to TechCrunch parent Yahoo.\n\nAt the same time, the media ecosystem is becoming more fragmented than ever with journalists establishing their own newsletters and Substacks. Twitter, once a hot spot for finding the latest breaking news, has morphed into a more right-leaning app \u201cX,\u201d whose existence has prompted a host of new competitors. In addition, changes at Google and Meta have resulted in a sizable drop in traffic to online publishers, leading to widespread media layoffs. And with AI, the situation looks like it may worsen, as apps and Google begin offering AI summaries of news, potentially losing publishers even more clicks.\n\nChandler believes Smashing can address many of these problems by not only surfacing the articles and posts that are worth people\u2019s time but also encouraging users to visit the publishers\u2019 sites to read more.\n\n\u201cI named Goodreads \u2018Goodreads\u2019 and not \u2018Goodbooks\u2019 because I one day hoped to add articles,\u201d Chandler said. As it turned out, \u201cbooks\u201d was a large enough category on its own to sustain the app, which sold to Amazon in 2013. Chandler continued to work there until five years ago.\n\nImage Credits: Smashing\n\nThe Smashing CEO says he always had an \u201citch to scratch around the rest of the content on the web, which is not just articles.\u201d It\u2019s podcasts, blogs, news articles, tweets, social media posts and YouTube videos, he says. \u201cAny interesting content.\u201d\n\nImage Credits: Smashing\n\nWhat prompted him to start building Smashing, however, was an experience he had during his sabbatical from work following his departure from Amazon. After a month or two of downtime, Chandler decided to challenge himself by entering a Half Ironman triathlon.\n\n\u201cThat led me down a journey of, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve got to learn about training and bicycling, and how to stay in shape and not burn my legs out, and how to eat right for nutrition, how to, therefore, cook better, because I didn\u2019t know how to cook before that,\u201d he said. But, when trying to use a traditional search engine, it was hard to find the best content. \u201cIf you just Google, \u2018how to train for a Half Ironman Triathlon\u2019 or \u2018how to eat healthy,\u2019 you get a lot of content. But it\u2019s not the content you\u2019re really looking for. It\u2019s a lot of SEO-optimized, ad-stuffed pages.\u201d\n\nTo try to find the content he wanted, Chandler tried news aggregators, like Apple News and Google News, Reddit, Twitter, social media and other smaller and medium-sized apps.\n\n\u201cI tried everything I could find, and I was really dissatisfied with the answers I got. I couldn\u2019t find anything I could dial to give me just good, interesting, accurate content. And that led me to the thesis for Smashing,\u201d Chandler said.\n\nHe then teamed up in 2022 with a former co-worker, Greg Veen, now a Smashing co-founder, whose tech background includes founding Measure Map, which sold to Google, and Typekit, which exited to Adobe.\n\nFrom user research, they found that people generally had five or six main interests they\u2019d follow online, including a few related to work and a few that were personal interests. They would follow sources that ranged from niche newsletters to social media influencers to publications and more. But they reported feeling overwhelmed.\n\nImage Credits: Smashing\n\nBuilt over the last year, following a seed round, Smashing\u2019s iOS app lets users follow their interests in a way that\u2019s reminiscent of another AI news app, Artifact, but with a broader focus.

{"title": "General Catalyst leads $40M round for Local Kitchens, a different kind of restaurant kitchen startup", "text": "At a time when companies are shuttering their cloud and ghost kitchens, Local Kitchens is proving its tech-enabled multi-brand restaurant concept is a business model that can work. And it grabbed $40 million in new Series B funding for its efforts.\n\nJon Goldsmith and Andrew Munday, formerly of DoorDash, teamed up with Jordan Bramble to start the San Francisco-based company in 2020. Their goal was to offer dishes from local restaurants and nationally recognized chefs to consumers in Northern California.\n\nLocal Kitchens operates in a similar manner to cloud and ghost kitchens, which are shared workspaces for restaurants to cook meals, often exclusively for delivery. The company developed a digital format to manage mobile app orders for multiple brands from a single kitchen.\n\nHowever, CEO Goldsmith insists the company is not a ghost kitchen (which is, perhaps, not surprising, given how out-of-favor the category has become). Here\u2019s how he describes the difference: Local Kitchens operates the restaurant locations itself \u2014 there are 12 now. This means the company employs the people cooking the food and works with partner restaurants and chefs to train them on their recipes. It also offers dining room service rather than just delivery to provide a more human connection.\n\nThat model enables the company to achieve 50% more sales per person per hour than traditional restaurants, Goldsmith said.\n\n\u201cOne of the advantages of this model is that we\u2019re more efficient from a sales per labor hour perspective,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cThat means we can really reinvest in hiring great people, paying them and training them well. That\u2019s critical to get food quality in a model like this where you have eight brands coming from one kitchen.\u201d\n\nIn San Francisco, the company is working with local brands, including Sushirrito and Boba Guys, and with nationally recognized chefs like Mason Hereford, founder of New Orleans sandwich shop Turkey and the Wolf. Bon App\u00e9tit named it the \u201cBest New Restaurant in America\u201d in 2017.\n\nSince its Series A in 2021, Local Kitchens grew 5x and achieved unit-level profitability. Plus, 1 in 10 households in the San Francisco Bay Area have tried the service, Goldsmith said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve become a weekly habit, especially for guests who don\u2019t feel like cooking,\u201d he said. \u201cA family or couple can order from Local Kitchens and find something for everyone.\u201d\n\nNot every company in this industry is doing this well. It wasn\u2019t too long ago that the cloud and ghost kitchen concept was flying high, buoyed by the global pandemic when everyone was stuck at home yet wanted food delivered.\n\nIn fact, that industry was doing so well that it was poised to make up more than 20% of the restaurant industry by 2025. Startups also attracted capital from top investors over the years, like SoftBank and Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nBut that\u2019s not happening as planned. After restaurants opened again, the concept became difficult to maintain. Even by big fast-food chains like Wendy\u2019s.\n\nMeanwhile, Kitchen United, which raised some $150 million in venture-backed funding and was touted as a \u201cone-time ghost kitchen leader\u201d by Fast Company, decided to sell assets to Sam Nazarian-led lifestyle hospitality company SBE in March.\n\nLocal Kitchens defying those odds and wanting to expand into new communities in Los Angeles and beyond California made it a good bet for General Catalyst. The firm doubled down on the company, leading the $40 million Series B and a previously unannounced follow-on to its Series A round.\n\nKyle Doherty, managing director at General Catalyst, said ghost kitchens initially \u201cpromised to drive pivotal change in customer value and efficiency.\u201d However, issues like inauthentic menus, poor quality control, questionable preparation methods and unsustainable unit economics prevented certain business models from gaining a strong foothold in the restaurant industry post-COVID.\n\nBy creating what Doherty called \u201ca new category that\u2019s in our view reflective of the ideal dining experience,\u201d Local Kitchens has \u201cthe perfect blend of prioritizing what consumers need and using innovation to fix restaurant challenges and inefficiencies.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven years after food delivery growth proved to be a long-lasting trend, customers are still being forced to sacrifice the factors that make eating out enjoyable, and choose between high-quality food and good service,\u201d Doherty told TechCrunch. \u201cLocal Kitchens is accomplishing what other food delivery models have not been capable of \u2014 meeting customer experience preferences, driving unparalleled efficiency, and creating a solution that delights consumers, chefs and local communities alike.\u201d\n\nGeneral Catalyst was joined by other existing investors Human Capital, Pear VC and Stanley Tang, co-founder of DoorDash, who joins the company\u2019s board of directors. This brings Local Kitchens\u2019 total funding to $75 million.\n\n\u201cStanley has been a friend and a mentor to us,\u201d Goldsmith said. \u201cHe\u2019s also been involved with Local Kitchens since the beginning of the company, and we\u2019re excited to have him officially join the board.\u201d", "authors": "['Christine Hall']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Copy-of-Founder-Pic.jpeg?resize=1200,700", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/local-kitchens-general-catalyst-40m/", "timestamp": "1719367224.971075", "displayed": 0}

It wasn\u2019t too long ago that the cloud and ghost kitchen concept was flying high, buoyed by the global pandemic when everyone was stuck at home yet wanted food delivered.\n\nIn fact, that industry was doing so well that it was poised to make up more than 20% of the restaurant industry by 2025. Startups also attracted capital from top investors over the years, like SoftBank and Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nBut that\u2019s not happening as planned. After restaurants opened again, the concept became difficult to maintain. Even by big fast-food chains like Wendy\u2019s.\n\nMeanwhile, Kitchen United, which raised some $150 million in venture-backed funding and was touted as a \u201cone-time ghost kitchen leader\u201d by Fast Company, decided to sell assets to Sam Nazarian-led lifestyle hospitality company SBE in March.\n\nLocal Kitchens defying those odds and wanting to expand into new communities in Los Angeles and beyond California made it a good bet for General Catalyst. The firm doubled down on the company, leading the $40 million Series B and a previously unannounced follow-on to its Series A round.\n\nKyle Doherty, managing director at General Catalyst, said ghost kitchens initially \u201cpromised to drive pivotal change in customer value and efficiency.\u201d However, issues like inauthentic menus, poor quality control, questionable preparation methods and unsustainable unit economics prevented certain business models from gaining a strong foothold in the restaurant industry post-COVID.\n\nBy creating what Doherty called \u201ca new category that\u2019s in our view reflective of the ideal dining experience,\u201d Local Kitchens has \u201cthe perfect blend of prioritizing what consumers need and using innovation to fix restaurant challenges and inefficiencies.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven years after food delivery growth proved to be a long-lasting trend, customers are still being forced to sacrifice the factors that make eating out enjoyable, and choose between high-quality food and good service,\u201d Doherty told TechCrunch. \u201cLocal Kitchens is accomplishing what other food delivery models have not been capable of \u2014 meeting customer experience preferences, driving unparalleled efficiency, and creating a solution that delights consumers, chefs and local communities alike.\u201d\n\nGeneral Catalyst was joined by other existing investors Human Capital, Pear VC and Stanley Tang, co-founder of DoorDash, who joins the company\u2019s board of directors. This brings Local Kitchens\u2019 total funding to $75 million.\n\n\u201cStanley has been a friend and a mentor to us,\u201d Goldsmith said. \u201cHe\u2019s also been involved with Local Kitchens since the beginning of the company, and we\u2019re excited to have him officially join the board.\u201d", "authors": "['Christine Hall']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Copy-of-Founder-Pic.jpeg?resize=1200,700", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/local-kitchens-general-catalyst-40m/", "timestamp": "1719367227.650205", "displayed": 0}

It plans to deploy AI to help enterprises better understand customer feedback.\n\nProfessional services teams at an enterprise are tasked with delivering projects to clients on time and within budget. However, for such a critical task, these teams do not get unified solutions and often juggle among multiple tools to get their work done. This delays project deliveries and makes clients anxious. Recently, a category called professional services automation (PSA) emerged to serve service teams. Nonetheless, some known PSA solutions still rely on traditional software, resulting in inaccuracy in project health reports and subpar delivery experiences.\n\nEnter Rocketlane. The startup, headquartered in Utah and Chennai, replaces several tools that professional services teams use for client projects, including time tracking, resource management, project accounting and management, document collaboration and communication, with what it calls its all-in-one modern PSA platform.\n\nFounded in April 2020 by second-time entrepreneurs Srikrishnan Ganesan, Vignesh Girishankar and Deepak Bala, Rocketlane initially aimed to support customer onboarding. However, it has broadened its scope and doubled down on addressing the needs of professional services teams.\n\nThe concept of Rocketlane came from the problems the co-founders faced while onboarding their customers in their previously built in-app messaging startup Freshchat, which Freshworks acquired in 2015.\n\n\u201cWe felt the projects that professional services teams were running were causing a lot of anxiety internally and externally \u2026 And the pattern we could see is this is a moment in time when the customer experiences a partnership with the vendor. And so if it goes well, if it\u2019s a happy partnership, then the customer doubles down on that partnership,\u201d Ganesan told TechCrunch.\n\nRocketlane targets mid-market and lower enterprise clients with professional services teams of 150 to 2,000 members. Its customer base includes OpenGov, LivePerson, Fivetran, Personio and Icertis. The startup competes against core PSA platforms such as Kantata and project management tools like Asana and Monday.com by combining both.\n\nThe all-equity Series B funding, co-led by 8VC, Matrix Partners India and Nexus Venture Partners, will enable Rocketlane to enhance its PSA platform.\n\nGanesan said that the startup plans to introduce conversational AI to help professional services teams get signals from client meetings on whether customers want to continue to pay for their projects or could take a back seat. Rocketlane is also introducing AI templates for emails and documents that the services teams use. Additionally, the startup is upgrading the customer portal it offers to enterprises for their clients with a website builder-like experience to make it consistent with their brand.\n\nRocketlane currently has 500 paying customers globally, with 60% of its total revenue coming from the U.S. It plans expansion in the U.S. by hiring more leadership and sales positions. Further, it looks to expand into Europe by hosting a one-day event in September.\n\nThe startup has a headcount of 120 people: 15 in the U.S. and the rest in India.\n\nTo date, Rocketlane raised $45 million, with its Series A round of $18 million coming in January 2022.

The startup, headquartered in Utah and Chennai, replaces several tools that professional services teams use for client projects, including time tracking, resource management, project accounting and management, document collaboration and communication, with what it calls its all-in-one modern PSA platform.\n\nFounded in April 2020 by second-time entrepreneurs Srikrishnan Ganesan, Vignesh Girishankar and Deepak Bala, Rocketlane initially aimed to support customer onboarding. However, it has broadened its scope and doubled down on addressing the needs of professional services teams.\n\nThe concept of Rocketlane came from the problems the co-founders faced while onboarding their customers in their previously built in-app messaging startup Freshchat, which Freshworks acquired in 2015.\n\n\u201cWe felt the projects that professional services teams were running were causing a lot of anxiety internally and externally \u2026 And the pattern we could see is this is a moment in time when the customer experiences a partnership with the vendor. And so if it goes well, if it\u2019s a happy partnership, then the customer doubles down on that partnership,\u201d Ganesan told TechCrunch.\n\nRocketlane targets mid-market and lower enterprise clients with professional services teams of 150 to 2,000 members. Its customer base includes OpenGov, LivePerson, Fivetran, Personio and Icertis. The startup competes against core PSA platforms such as Kantata and project management tools like Asana and Monday.com by combining both.\n\nThe all-equity Series B funding, co-led by 8VC, Matrix Partners India and Nexus Venture Partners, will enable Rocketlane to enhance its PSA platform.\n\nGanesan said that the startup plans to introduce conversational AI to help professional services teams get signals from client meetings on whether customers want to continue to pay for their projects or could take a back seat. Rocketlane is also introducing AI templates for emails and documents that the services teams use. Additionally, the startup is upgrading the customer portal it offers to enterprises for their clients with a website builder-like experience to make it consistent with their brand.\n\nRocketlane currently has 500 paying customers globally, with 60% of its total revenue coming from the U.S. It plans expansion in the U.S. by hiring more leadership and sales positions. Further, it looks to expand into Europe by hosting a one-day event in September.\n\nThe startup has a headcount of 120 people: 15 in the U.S. and the rest in India.\n\nTo date, Rocketlane raised $45 million, with its Series A round of $18 million coming in January 2022. Ganesan said the startup\u2019s valuation grew around 2x the last round, without sharing any specifics. He also mentioned that the startup saw over 3.1x growth in revenues in 2023.", "authors": "['Jagmeet Singh']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/rocketlane-co-founders.jpg?w=1200", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/rocketlane-snags-24m-to-bring-ai-led-experiences-for-professional-services-teams/", "timestamp": "1719367243.976556", "displayed": 0}

It has raised $18 million in a new funding round to expand its presence to more than 40 countries worldwide.\n\nThe Gurugram-based startup works with Indian factories to help them manufacture fashion wear for global brands. It offers ERP (enterprise resource planning) software, which it calls the \u201cbrain of manufacturing,\u201d that tells factories what needs to be produced, how it should be made and when it should be made to let them fully utilize their capacity.\n\nMore than 80,000 small and medium factories in India have a capacity utilization of less than 33%, Zyod co-founder Ankit Jaipuria told TechCrunch. Through its ERP platform, the startup helps factories understand what components \u2014 like fabric \u2014 they need to use to produce clothes for a specific brand. It also explains the pattern in which the fabric should be cut and stitched based on the requirement raised by the brand to get maximum utilization.\n\nFurther, the startup has developed a daily production reporting system to give a day-to-day action plan to factories. This overcomes the challenges that local factories and their labor face in a typical environment where factory owners manage operations through paper and pen or via WhatsApp.\n\n\u201cWe are giving that day-to-day instruction, which earlier was given by a factory owner, and that\u2019s: how it has to be made, when it has to be made, what has to be made \u2014 all of this runs through Zyod, and that\u2019s why I say Zyod acts as a brain of manufacturing, and the factories act as executing arms,\u201d Jaipuria said.\n\nCo-founded in early 2023 by Jaipuria and Ritesh Khandelwal, Zyod currently serves more than 550 customers in over 18 countries, adding about 400 customers in the last two years. The startup initially helped D2C brands with faster launch time and low minimum order quantity. However, in the October quarter, it started onboarding enterprise customers and has since added major brands, including Reliance Industries and Aditya Birla in India. It also counts Japan\u2019s Urban Research, Anthropologie of Pennsylvania, U.K.\u2019s NEXT and Boohoo, and VAN-DOS of Spain among its early clients.\n\nIn January, Zyod launched its mobile app across iOS and Android platforms. It focuses on long-tail customers that want to purchase different styles on the go. The app also helps enterprise clients see their orders. Zyod additionally plans to update the app with new communication methods, including approving orders and communicating with teams through live chat windows.\n\nThe $18 million investment is Zyod\u2019s Series A round led by RTP Global and including participation from existing investors Lightspeed and Alteria Capital and new investors Stride Ventures, Stride One and Trifecta Capital. The money will help the startup grow its presence in the Southern Hemisphere and penetrate markets such as Brazil and Australia. It also looks to enter a few under-tapped countries, including Africa and the Scandinavian part of Europe.\n\n\u201cOnce we have expanded very well into both hemispheres, we can have all-season products consistent for our factories running in India,\u201d Jaipuria said.\n\nZyod has expanded its catalog to 10,000 styles a month from 10 or 20 initially.

{"title": "Emergence thinks it can crack the AI agent code", "text": "Yet another generative AI venture has raised a bundle of money. And, like the others before it, it\u2019s promising the moon.\n\nEmergence, whose co-founders include Satya Nitta, the former head of global AI solutions at IBM\u2019s research division, on Monday emerged from stealth with $97.2 million in funding from Learn Capital plus credit lines totaling more than $100 million. Emergence claims to be building an \u201cagent-based\u201d system that can perform many of the tasks typically handled by knowledge workers, in part by routing these tasks to first- and third-party generative AI models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o.\n\n\u201cAt Emergence, we are working on multiple aspects of the evolving field of generative AI agents,\u201d Nitta, Emergence\u2019s CEO, told TechCrunch. \u201cIn our R&D labs, we are advancing the science of agentic systems and tackling this from a \u2018first principles\u2019 perspective. This includes critical AI tasks such as planning and reasoning as well as self-improvement in agents.\u201d\n\nNitta says that the idea for Emergence came shortly after he co-founded Merlyn Mind, which builds education-oriented virtual assistants. He realized that some of the same technologies developed at Merlyn could be applied to automate workstation software and web apps.\n\nSo Nitta recruited fellow ex-IBMers Ravi Kokku and Sharad Sundararajan to launch Emergence, with the goal of \u201cadvancing the science and development of AI agents,\u201d in Nitta\u2019s words.\n\n\u201cCurrent generative AI models, while powerful in language understanding, still lag in advanced planning and reasoning capabilities necessary for more complex automation tasks which are the provenance of agents,\u201d Nitta said. \u201cThis is what Emergence specializes in.\u201d\n\nEmergence has a very aspirational roadmap that includes a project called Agent E, which seeks to automate tasks like filling out forms, searching for products across online marketplaces and navigating streaming services like Netflix. An early form of Agent E is already available, trained on a mix of synthetic and human-annotated data. But Emergence\u2019s first finished product is what Nitta describes as an \u201corchestrator\u201d agent.\n\nThis orchestrator, open sourced Monday, doesn\u2019t perform any tasks itself. Rather, it functions as a kind of automatic model switcher for workflow automations. Factoring in things like the capabilities of and the cost to use a model (if it\u2019s third party), the orchestrator considers the task to be performed \u2014 for example, writing an email \u2014 then chooses a model from a developer-curated list to complete that task.\n\nAn early version of Emergence\u2019s Agent E project. Image Credits: Emergence\n\n\u201cDevelopers can add appropriate guardrails, use multiple models for their workflows and applications, and seamlessly switch to the latest open source or generalist model on demand without having to worry about issues such as cost, prompt migration or availability,\u201d Nitta said.\n\nEmergence\u2019s orchestrator seems quite similar in concept to AI startup Martian\u2019s model router, which takes in a prompt intended for an AI model and automatically routes it to different models depending on things like uptime and features. Another startup, Credal, provides a more basic model-routing solution driven by hard-coded rules.\n\nNitta doesn\u2019t deny the similarities. But he not-so-subtly suggests that Emergence\u2019s model-routing tech is more reliable than others; he also notes that it offers additional configuration features like a manual model selector, API management and a cost overview dashboard.\n\n\u201cOur orchestrator agent is built with a deep understanding of scalability, robustness and availability that enterprise systems need and is backed by decades of experience that our team possesses in building some of the most scaled AI deployments in the world,\u201d he said.\n\nEmergence intends to monetize the orchestrator with a hosted, available-through-an-API premium version in the coming weeks. But that\u2019s only a slice of the company\u2019s grand plan to build a platform that, among other things, processes claims and documents, manages IT systems, and integrates with customer relationship management systems like Salesforce and Zendesk to triage customer inquiries.\n\nToward this end, Emergence says it\u2019s formed strategic partnerships with Samsung and touch display company Newline Interactive \u2014 both of which are existing Merlyn Mind customers, in what seems unlikely to be a coincidence \u2014 to integrate Emergence\u2019s tech into future products.\n\nAnother screenshot of Emergence\u2019s Agent E in action. Image Credits: Emergence\n\nWhich specific products and when can we expect to see them? Samsung\u2019s WAD interactive displays and Newline\u2019s Q and Q Pro series displays, Nitta said, but he didn\u2019t have an answer to the second question, implying that it\u2019s very early days.\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that AI agents are buzzy right now. Generative AI powerhouses OpenAI and Anthropic are developing task-performing agentic products, as are Big Tech companies, including Google and Amazon.\n\nBut it\u2019s not obvious where Emergence\u2019s differentiation lies, besides the sizable amount of cash out of the starting gate.\n\nTechCrunch recently covered another AI agent startup, Orby, with a similar sales pitch: AI agents trained to work across a range of desktop software. Adept, too, was developing tech along these lines, but despite raising more than $415 million reportedly now finds itself on the brink of a bailout from either Microsoft or Meta.\n\nEmergence is positioning itself as more R&D-heavy than most: the \u201cOpenAI of agents,\u201d if you will, with a research lab dedicated to investigating how agents might plan, reason and self-improve. And it\u2019s drawing from an impressive talent pool; many of its researchers and software engineers hail from Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and the Allen Institute for AI.\n\nNitta says that Emergence\u2019s guiding light will be prioritizing openly available work while building paid services on top of its research, a playbook borrowed from the software-as-a-service sector. Tens of thousands of people are already using early versions of Emergence\u2019s services, he claims.\n\n\u201cOur conviction is that our work becomes foundational to how multiple enterprise workflows get automated in the future,\u201d Nitta said.\n\nColor me skeptical, but I\u2019m not convinced that Emergence\u2019s 50-person team can outgun the rest of the players in the generative AI space \u2014 nor that it\u2019ll solve the overarching technical challenges plaguing generative AI, like hallucinations and the mammoth cost of developing models. Cognition Labs\u2019 Devin, one of the best-performing agents for building and deploying software, only manages to get around a 14% success rate on a benchmark test measuring the ability to resolve issues on GitHub. There\u2019s clearly a lot of work to be done to reach the point where agents can juggle complex processes without oversight.\n\nEmergence has the capital to try \u2014 for now. But it might not in the future as VCs \u2014 and businesses \u2014 express increased skepticism in generative AI tech\u2019s path to ROI.\n\nNitta, projecting the confidence of someone whose startup just raised $100 million, asserted that Emergence is well-positioned for success.\n\n\u201cEmergence is resilient due to its focus on solving fundamental AI infrastructure problems that have a clear and immediate ROI for enterprises,\u201d he said. \u201cOur open-core business model, combined with premium services, ensures a steady revenue stream while fostering a growing community of developers and early adopters.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll see soon enough.", "authors": "['Kyle Wiggers']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nice-A1-Key-Alt-4.jpeg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/24/emergence-thinks-it-can-crack-the-ai-agent-code/", "timestamp": "1719367264.219954", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "Emergence thinks it can crack the AI agent code", "text": "Yet another generative AI venture has raised a bundle of money. And, like the others before it, it\u2019s promising the moon.\n\nEmergence, whose co-founders include Satya Nitta, the former head of global AI solutions at IBM\u2019s research division, on Monday emerged from stealth with $97.2 million in funding from Learn Capital plus credit lines totaling more than $100 million. Emergence claims to be building an \u201cagent-based\u201d system that can perform many of the tasks typically handled by knowledge workers, in part by routing these tasks to first- and third-party generative AI models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o.\n\n\u201cAt Emergence, we are working on multiple aspects of the evolving field of generative AI agents,\u201d Nitta, Emergence\u2019s CEO, told TechCrunch. \u201cIn our R&D labs, we are advancing the science of agentic systems and tackling this from a \u2018first principles\u2019 perspective. This includes critical AI tasks such as planning and reasoning as well as self-improvement in agents.\u201d\n\nNitta says that the idea for Emergence came shortly after he co-founded Merlyn Mind, which builds education-oriented virtual assistants. He realized that some of the same technologies developed at Merlyn could be applied to automate workstation software and web apps.\n\nSo Nitta recruited fellow ex-IBMers Ravi Kokku and Sharad Sundararajan to launch Emergence, with the goal of \u201cadvancing the science and development of AI agents,\u201d in Nitta\u2019s words.\n\n\u201cCurrent generative AI models, while powerful in language understanding, still lag in advanced planning and reasoning capabilities necessary for more complex automation tasks which are the provenance of agents,\u201d Nitta said. \u201cThis is what Emergence specializes in.\u201d\n\nEmergence has a very aspirational roadmap that includes a project called Agent E, which seeks to automate tasks like filling out forms, searching for products across online marketplaces and navigating streaming services like Netflix. An early form of Agent E is already available, trained on a mix of synthetic and human-annotated data. But Emergence\u2019s first finished product is what Nitta describes as an \u201corchestrator\u201d agent.\n\nThis orchestrator, open sourced Monday, doesn\u2019t perform any tasks itself. Rather, it functions as a kind of automatic model switcher for workflow automations. Factoring in things like the capabilities of and the cost to use a model (if it\u2019s third party), the orchestrator considers the task to be performed \u2014 for example, writing an email \u2014 then chooses a model from a developer-curated list to complete that task.\n\nAn early version of Emergence\u2019s Agent E project. Image Credits: Emergence\n\n\u201cDevelopers can add appropriate guardrails, use multiple models for their workflows and applications, and seamlessly switch to the latest open source or generalist model on demand without having to worry about issues such as cost, prompt migration or availability,\u201d Nitta said.\n\nEmergence\u2019s orchestrator seems quite similar in concept to AI startup Martian\u2019s model router, which takes in a prompt intended for an AI model and automatically routes it to different models depending on things like uptime and features. Another startup, Credal, provides a more basic model-routing solution driven by hard-coded rules.\n\nNitta doesn\u2019t deny the similarities. But he not-so-subtly suggests that Emergence\u2019s model-routing tech is more reliable than others; he also notes that it offers additional configuration features like a manual model selector, API management and a cost overview dashboard.\n\n\u201cOur orchestrator agent is built with a deep understanding of scalability, robustness and availability that enterprise systems need and is backed by decades of experience that our team possesses in building some of the most scaled AI deployments in the world,\u201d he said.\n\nEmergence intends to monetize the orchestrator with a hosted, available-through-an-API premium version in the coming weeks. But that\u2019s only a slice of the company\u2019s grand plan to build a platform that, among other things, processes claims and documents, manages IT systems, and integrates with customer relationship management systems like Salesforce and Zendesk to triage customer inquiries.\n\nToward this end, Emergence says it\u2019s formed strategic partnerships with Samsung and touch display company Newline Interactive \u2014 both of which are existing Merlyn Mind customers, in what seems unlikely to be a coincidence \u2014 to integrate Emergence\u2019s tech into future products.\n\nAnother screenshot of Emergence\u2019s Agent E in action. Image Credits: Emergence\n\nWhich specific products and when can we expect to see them? Samsung\u2019s WAD interactive displays and Newline\u2019s Q and Q Pro series displays, Nitta said, but he didn\u2019t have an answer to the second question, implying that it\u2019s very early days.\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that AI agents are buzzy right now. Generative AI powerhouses OpenAI and Anthropic are developing task-performing agentic products, as are Big Tech companies, including Google and Amazon.\n\nBut it\u2019s not obvious where Emergence\u2019s differentiation lies, besides the sizable amount of cash out of the starting gate.\n\nTechCrunch recently covered another AI agent startup, Orby, with a similar sales pitch: AI agents trained to work across a range of desktop software. Adept, too, was developing tech along these lines, but despite raising more than $415 million reportedly now finds itself on the brink of a bailout from either Microsoft or Meta.\n\nEmergence is positioning itself as more R&D-heavy than most: the \u201cOpenAI of agents,\u201d if you will, with a research lab dedicated to investigating how agents might plan, reason and self-improve. And it\u2019s drawing from an impressive talent pool; many of its researchers and software engineers hail from Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and the Allen Institute for AI.\n\nNitta says that Emergence\u2019s guiding light will be prioritizing openly available work while building paid services on top of its research, a playbook borrowed from the software-as-a-service sector. Tens of thousands of people are already using early versions of Emergence\u2019s services, he claims.\n\n\u201cOur conviction is that our work becomes foundational to how multiple enterprise workflows get automated in the future,\u201d Nitta said.\n\nColor me skeptical, but I\u2019m not convinced that Emergence\u2019s 50-person team can outgun the rest of the players in the generative AI space \u2014 nor that it\u2019ll solve the overarching technical challenges plaguing generative AI, like hallucinations and the mammoth cost of developing models. Cognition Labs\u2019 Devin, one of the best-performing agents for building and deploying software, only manages to get around a 14% success rate on a benchmark test measuring the ability to resolve issues on GitHub. There\u2019s clearly a lot of work to be done to reach the point where agents can juggle complex processes without oversight.\n\nEmergence has the capital to try \u2014 for now. But it might not in the future as VCs \u2014 and businesses \u2014 express increased skepticism in generative AI tech\u2019s path to ROI.\n\nNitta, projecting the confidence of someone whose startup just raised $100 million, asserted that Emergence is well-positioned for success.\n\n\u201cEmergence is resilient due to its focus on solving fundamental AI infrastructure problems that have a clear and immediate ROI for enterprises,\u201d he said. \u201cOur open-core business model, combined with premium services, ensures a steady revenue stream while fostering a growing community of developers and early adopters.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll see soon enough.", "authors": "['Kyle Wiggers']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nice-A1-Key-Alt-4.jpeg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/24/emergence-thinks-it-can-crack-the-ai-agent-code/", "timestamp": "1719367266.8599522", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "Silicon Valley leaders are once again declaring \u2018DEI\u2019 bad and \u2018meritocracy\u2019 good \u2014 but they\u2019re wrong", "text": "No, Silicon Valley, a \u2018meritocracy\u2019 is not better than DEI, according to the data\n\nWho\u2019s afraid of the Big Bad DEI? The acronym is near-poisonous now \u2014 a word that creates almost instant tension between those who embrace it and those who want it dead.\n\nA prime example of this divide was the response to startup Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang\u2019s post on X last week. He wrote about moving away from DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) to instead embrace \u201cMEI\u201d \u2014 merit, excellence, and intelligence.\n\n\u201cScale is a meritocracy, and we must always remain one,\u201d Wang wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal whenever we invite someone to join our mission, and those decisions have never been swayed by orthodoxy or virtue signaling or whatever the current thing is.\u201d\n\nToday we\u2019ve formalized an important hiring policy at Scale. We hire for MEI: merit, excellence, and intelligence.\n\n\n\nThis is the email I\u2019ve shared with our @scale_AI team.\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\nMERITOCRACY AT SCALE\n\n\n\nIn the wake of our fundraise, I\u2019ve been getting a lot of questions\u2026 \u2014 Alexandr Wang (@alexandr_wang) June 13, 2024\n\nThe commenters on X \u2014 which included Elon Musk, Palmer Luckey, and Brian Armstrong \u2014 were thrilled. On LinkedIn, however, the startup community gave a less-than-enthusiastic response. Those commenters pointed out that Wang\u2019s post made it seem as if \u201cmeritocracy\u201d was the definitive benchmark to find qualified hiring candidates \u2014 without taking into consideration that the idea of meritocracy is itself subjective. In the days that have followed the post, more and more people have shared their thoughts and what Wang\u2019s comments reveal about the current state of DEI in tech.\n\n\u201cThe post is misguided because people who support the meritocracy argument are ignoring the structural reasons some groups are more likely to outperform others,\u201d Mutale Nkonde, a founder working in AI policy, told TechCrunch. \u201dWe all want the best people for the job, and there is data to prove that diverse teams are more effective.\u201d\n\nEmily Witko, an HR professional at AI startup Hugging Face, told TechCrunch that the post was a \u201cdangerous oversimplification,\u201d but that it received so much attention on X because it \u201copenly expressed sentiments that are not always expressed publicly and the audience there is hungry to attack DEI.\u201d Wang\u2019s MEI thought \u201cmakes it so easy to refute or criticize any conversations regarding the importance of acknowledging underrepresentation in tech,\u201d she continued.\n\nBut Wang is far from the only Silicon Valley insider to attack DEI in recent months. He joins a chorus of those who feel that DEI programs implemented at businesses over the past several years, peaking with the Black Lives Matter movement, caused a backslide in corporate profitability \u2014 and that a return to \u201cmeritocratic principles\u201d is overdue. Indeed, much of the tech industry has worked to dismantle recruitment programs that considered candidates who, under previous hiring regimes, were often overlooked in the hiring process.\n\nSeeking to make a change, in 2020, many organizations and power players came together to promise more of a focus on DEI, which, contrary to the mainstream discussion, is not simply about hiring someone based on the color of their skin but is about ensuring qualified people from all walks of life \u2014 regardless of skin, gender, or ethnic background \u2014 are better represented and included in recruitment funnels. It\u2019s also about taking a look at disparities and pipeline issues, analyzing the reasoning behind why certain candidates are constantly overlooked in a hiring process.\n\nIn 2023, the U.S. data industry saw new women recruit levels drop by two-thirds, from 36% in 2022 to just 12%, according to a report from HR staffing firm Harnham. Meanwhile, the percentage of Black, Indigenous, and professionals of color in VP or above data roles stood at just 38% in 2022.\n\nAlexandr Wang (pictured above) caused a stir on social media when he posted about meritocracy in tech on X. Image Credits: Drew Angerer / Staff / Getty Images\n\nDEI-related job listings have also fallen out of favor, declining 44% in 2023, according to data from the job site Indeed. In the AI industry, a recent Deloitte survey of women found that over half said they ended up leaving at least one employer because of how men and women were treated differently, while 73% considered leaving the tech industry altogether due to unequal pay and an inability to advance in their careers.\n\nYet, for an industry that prides itself on being data-driven, Silicon Valley cannot let the idea of a meritocracy go \u2014 despite all the data and research showing how such thinking is just a belief system and one that can lead to biased outcomes. The idea of going out and hiring \u201cthe best person for the job\u201d without taking into account any human sociology is how pattern-matching occurs \u2014 teams and companies of people who are alike, when the research has long shown that more diverse teams perform better. Moreover, it has only raised suspicions about who the Valley considers excellent and why.\n\nExperts we spoke to said this subjectiveness revealed other issues with Wang\u2019s missive \u2014 mostly that he presents MEI as a revolutionary idea and not one that Silicon Valley and most of corporate America have long embraced. The acronym \u201cMEI\u201d appears to be a scornful nod to DEI, intended to drive home the notion that a company must choose between hiring diverse candidates or candidates that meet certain \u201cobjective\u201d qualifications.\n\nNatalie Sue Johnson, co-founder of the DEI consulting firm Paradigm, told TechCrunch that research has shown meritocracy to be a paradox and that organizations that focus too much on it actually see an increase in bias. \u201cIt frees people up from thinking that they have to try hard to be fair in their decision-making,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey think that meritocracy is inherent, not something that needs to be achieved.\u201d\n\nAs Nkonde mentioned, Johnson noted that Wang\u2019s approach doesn\u2019t acknowledge that underrepresented groups face systemic barriers society is still struggling to address. Ironically, the most meritorious person could be the one who has achieved a skill set for a job despite such barriers that may have influenced their educational background or prevented them from filling their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with the kind of college internships that impresses Silicon Valley.\n\nTreating a person as a faceless, nameless candidate, without understanding their unique experiences, and therefore their employability, is a mistake, Johnson said. \u201cThere is nuance.\u201d\n\nWitko added to that: \u201cA meritocratic system is built on criteria that reflect the status quo, and therefore, it will perpetuate existing inequalities by continuously favoring those who already have advantages.\u201d\n\nTo be somewhat charitable to Wang, given how acidic the term DEI has become, developing a new term that still represents the value of fairness to all candidates, isn\u2019t a terrible idea \u2014 even if \u201cmeritocracy\u201d is misguided.

{"title": "Silicon Valley leaders are once again declaring \u2018DEI\u2019 bad and \u2018meritocracy\u2019 good \u2014 but they\u2019re wrong", "text": "No, Silicon Valley, a \u2018meritocracy\u2019 is not better than DEI, according to the data\n\nWho\u2019s afraid of the Big Bad DEI? The acronym is near-poisonous now \u2014 a word that creates almost instant tension between those who embrace it and those who want it dead.\n\nA prime example of this divide was the response to startup Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang\u2019s post on X last week. He wrote about moving away from DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) to instead embrace \u201cMEI\u201d \u2014 merit, excellence, and intelligence.\n\n\u201cScale is a meritocracy, and we must always remain one,\u201d Wang wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal whenever we invite someone to join our mission, and those decisions have never been swayed by orthodoxy or virtue signaling or whatever the current thing is.\u201d\n\nToday we\u2019ve formalized an important hiring policy at Scale. We hire for MEI: merit, excellence, and intelligence.\n\n\n\nThis is the email I\u2019ve shared with our @scale_AI team.\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\nMERITOCRACY AT SCALE\n\n\n\nIn the wake of our fundraise, I\u2019ve been getting a lot of questions\u2026 \u2014 Alexandr Wang (@alexandr_wang) June 13, 2024\n\nThe commenters on X \u2014 which included Elon Musk, Palmer Luckey, and Brian Armstrong \u2014 were thrilled. On LinkedIn, however, the startup community gave a less-than-enthusiastic response. Those commenters pointed out that Wang\u2019s post made it seem as if \u201cmeritocracy\u201d was the definitive benchmark to find qualified hiring candidates \u2014 without taking into consideration that the idea of meritocracy is itself subjective. In the days that have followed the post, more and more people have shared their thoughts and what Wang\u2019s comments reveal about the current state of DEI in tech.\n\n\u201cThe post is misguided because people who support the meritocracy argument are ignoring the structural reasons some groups are more likely to outperform others,\u201d Mutale Nkonde, a founder working in AI policy, told TechCrunch. \u201dWe all want the best people for the job, and there is data to prove that diverse teams are more effective.\u201d\n\nEmily Witko, an HR professional at AI startup Hugging Face, told TechCrunch that the post was a \u201cdangerous oversimplification,\u201d but that it received so much attention on X because it \u201copenly expressed sentiments that are not always expressed publicly and the audience there is hungry to attack DEI.\u201d Wang\u2019s MEI thought \u201cmakes it so easy to refute or criticize any conversations regarding the importance of acknowledging underrepresentation in tech,\u201d she continued.\n\nBut Wang is far from the only Silicon Valley insider to attack DEI in recent months. He joins a chorus of those who feel that DEI programs implemented at businesses over the past several years, peaking with the Black Lives Matter movement, caused a backslide in corporate profitability \u2014 and that a return to \u201cmeritocratic principles\u201d is overdue. Indeed, much of the tech industry has worked to dismantle recruitment programs that considered candidates who, under previous hiring regimes, were often overlooked in the hiring process.\n\nSeeking to make a change, in 2020, many organizations and power players came together to promise more of a focus on DEI, which, contrary to the mainstream discussion, is not simply about hiring someone based on the color of their skin but is about ensuring qualified people from all walks of life \u2014 regardless of skin, gender, or ethnic background \u2014 are better represented and included in recruitment funnels. It\u2019s also about taking a look at disparities and pipeline issues, analyzing the reasoning behind why certain candidates are constantly overlooked in a hiring process.\n\nIn 2023, the U.S. data industry saw new women recruit levels drop by two-thirds, from 36% in 2022 to just 12%, according to a report from HR staffing firm Harnham. Meanwhile, the percentage of Black, Indigenous, and professionals of color in VP or above data roles stood at just 38% in 2022.\n\nAlexandr Wang (pictured above) caused a stir on social media when he posted about meritocracy in tech on X. Image Credits: Drew Angerer / Staff / Getty Images\n\nDEI-related job listings have also fallen out of favor, declining 44% in 2023, according to data from the job site Indeed. In the AI industry, a recent Deloitte survey of women found that over half said they ended up leaving at least one employer because of how men and women were treated differently, while 73% considered leaving the tech industry altogether due to unequal pay and an inability to advance in their careers.\n\nYet, for an industry that prides itself on being data-driven, Silicon Valley cannot let the idea of a meritocracy go \u2014 despite all the data and research showing how such thinking is just a belief system and one that can lead to biased outcomes. The idea of going out and hiring \u201cthe best person for the job\u201d without taking into account any human sociology is how pattern-matching occurs \u2014 teams and companies of people who are alike, when the research has long shown that more diverse teams perform better. Moreover, it has only raised suspicions about who the Valley considers excellent and why.\n\nExperts we spoke to said this subjectiveness revealed other issues with Wang\u2019s missive \u2014 mostly that he presents MEI as a revolutionary idea and not one that Silicon Valley and most of corporate America have long embraced. The acronym \u201cMEI\u201d appears to be a scornful nod to DEI, intended to drive home the notion that a company must choose between hiring diverse candidates or candidates that meet certain \u201cobjective\u201d qualifications.\n\nNatalie Sue Johnson, co-founder of the DEI consulting firm Paradigm, told TechCrunch that research has shown meritocracy to be a paradox and that organizations that focus too much on it actually see an increase in bias. \u201cIt frees people up from thinking that they have to try hard to be fair in their decision-making,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey think that meritocracy is inherent, not something that needs to be achieved.\u201d\n\nAs Nkonde mentioned, Johnson noted that Wang\u2019s approach doesn\u2019t acknowledge that underrepresented groups face systemic barriers society is still struggling to address. Ironically, the most meritorious person could be the one who has achieved a skill set for a job despite such barriers that may have influenced their educational background or prevented them from filling their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with the kind of college internships that impresses Silicon Valley.\n\nTreating a person as a faceless, nameless candidate, without understanding their unique experiences, and therefore their employability, is a mistake, Johnson said. \u201cThere is nuance.\u201d\n\nWitko added to that: \u201cA meritocratic system is built on criteria that reflect the status quo, and therefore, it will perpetuate existing inequalities by continuously favoring those who already have advantages.\u201d\n\nTo be somewhat charitable to Wang, given how acidic the term DEI has become, developing a new term that still represents the value of fairness to all candidates, isn\u2019t a terrible idea \u2014 even if \u201cmeritocracy\u201d is misguided. And his post suggests that Scale AI\u2019s values could align with the spirit of diversity, equity, and inclusion even if he might not realize it, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cCasting a wide net for talent and making objective hiring decisions that do not disadvantage candidates based on identity is exactly what diversity, equity, and inclusion work seeks to do,\u201d she explained.\n\nBut again, where Wang undermines this is endorsing the mistaken belief that meritocracy will produce outcomes based on one\u2019s abilities and merits alone.\n\nPerhaps it is all a paradox.

Fitzgerald will head off to Duke in the fall and Van Landschoot will move near the university but is putting his college plans on hold to be a full-time startup founder.\n\nThe money was raised while they were still in high school after a prototype for their idea garnered a lot of interest among the large Boulder community of AI enthusiasts.\n\nAPIGen is working on a platform that will build custom APIs from natural language prompts. It will be able to, for instance, allow an e-commerce business to simply ask for an API that connects its web front end to its database, and the platform will deliver it.\n\nBy API, the founders don\u2019t just mean a standard \u201capplication programming interface\u201d that allows applications to exchange data or perform some other simple workflow function. They want APIGen to create complex custom APIs that can do multiple or serial tasks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually generating the code for the APIs so that you can have business logic, actual custom functionalities within those APIs as well,\u201d Van Landschoot told TechCrunch.\n\nIn addition to web apps and databases, Fitzgerald says IoT devices are one of his startup\u2019s target areas. He offers the example of a customer asking for an API that instructs a drone to fly around the perimeter of an area, capture images and allow another application to interface with the result. Another example is an API that uses face recognition for building security. Once a database of photos of verified employee faces is created, the user could ask APIGen for an API that lets a smartlock\u2019s door camera check the face of everyone who arrives against that database before unlocking the door.\n\n\u201cAPIs at the end of the day, can be as simple or as complex as you make them to be,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cThey can range from just new connectors that take one entry of data, one row of data from a table of a database, to entire back ends. And that\u2019s really what we\u2019re trying to target there, for entire web apps for entire IoT applications.\u201d\n\nThe teens met on their school\u2019s debate team and bonded over their love of coding. Their first project together was a chatbot that would allow people to chat with data. They soon realized that it wasn\u2019t an original idea. Still, while building that app, they learned that their tech relied on APIs and that \u201cmaking APIs was kind of a pain,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cThey were hard to design.\u201d\n\nSo they focused on that. Once they crafted an alpha version of their idea, a demo-level tool, they began to show it around to the programmers in their circle to get feedback. They knew people in their local tech industry. Van Landschoot\u2019s dad works in cybersecurity IT, and Fitzgerald landed a summer internship at SoftBank through a connection with a friend\u2019s dad.\n\nAnd then they started sending cold messages to VCs on LinkedIn and to anyone else they thought might respond.\n\n\u201cWe asked people to destroy this pitch deck,\u201d Fitzgerald said.\n\nPhil Broenniman (left), Ankur Ahuja (right), Varana Capital Image Credits: Varana Capital\n\nA VC is so impressed, he offers to invest\n\nOne of the people who got the message \u2014 and had heard about the founders through other connections in Denver/Boulder\u2019s tight-knit startup community \u2014 was Philip Broenniman, founder of Denver\u2019s Varana Capital. Varana began as a family office for Broenniman and a partner 13 years ago, and has since expanded into a firm with institutional LP money and $400 million in AUM, he told TechCrunch\n\nBroenniman and Varana COO Ankur Ahuja agreed to meet with the teens. \u201cWe went into the meeting thinking we were going to provide some fatherly, avuncular advice; provide some words of wisdom,\u201d Broenniman told TechCrunch. \u201cWe walked out after two hours of their presentation thinking that this was the best presentation we had heard in the last five years. We were blown away by the cogent insights these two 18-year-olds gave.\u201d\n\nWith Fitzgerald dressed in his best sweater and Van Landschoot in a debate-team-style collared shirt, they leaned into their debate training and pitched their company, their vision, the potential market and themselves.\n\nRather than feedback on the pitch, \u201cAt the end of the meeting, they mentioned that they were actually interested,\u201d Fitzgerald said of the Varana partners. Broenniman asked the teens how much money they were looking for.\n\nVarana did its diligence looking into the potential of the API market, which has created multibillion dollars\u2019 worth of successes (MuleSoft bought by Salesforce, Apigee bought by Google, to name just two). And it looked at the founders\u2019 backgrounds: Fitzgerald graduated as valedictorian of a top-ranked high school in Boulder, which has a highly ranked public education system; Van Landschoot was such a gifted programmer that he had been tutoring college computer science students since he was 14.\n\nThe Varana partners scheduled a second meeting for the founders to demo their tech to make sure the teens weren\u2019t just \u201cgood at talking but not delivering and doing stuff,\u201d as Van Landschoot described.\n\nThe teens were nervous, they confessed, but the demo went well and the VC offered a term sheet: $250,000 of pre-seed money with another $250,000 in a SAFE, which is a note that converts to equity if the startup raises later. The VC also provided office space.\n\nWhile they were pitching to the VCs, Fitzgerald learned about Boulder\u2019s active AI Meetup that has 1,400 members, organized by a dad of one of Fitzgerald\u2019s tennis team teammates. Boulder has a famously close and cozy startup community and, along with nearby Denver, hosts office outposts for Amazon, IBM, Google, Microsoft and many others.\n\nThe teens joined the group and demoed their product, and the local AI enthusiasts rallied behind them and their idea.\n\nAPIGen is obviously very early. And it isn\u2019t the only one working on automating APIs. Giant tech companies like Salesforce\u2019s MuleSoft and established startups like RapidAPI are already working on this market, as are most of the cloud giants.\n\nAPIGen also doesn\u2019t yet have its minimum viable product built, though it\u2019s getting closer with a beta version that will be released this month. \u201cWe\u2019ve already had some interest from businesses, but obviously we\u2019re still pre-MVP at this stage, and just cranking, trying to get it out as soon as possible,\u201d Fitzgerald said.\n\nStill, Broenniman, who takes board seats with investments, is in for the ride. He points to how the young founders have already built a community of eager supporters.\n\n\u201cAPIGen may be the vehicle into which we\u2019re making an investment, but we\u2019re creating partnership with Christopher and Nicholas,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a $7 billion-plus market.

The company is currently focused on growth, Xu said, but has plans for how to monetize in the future.\n\n\u201cMonday to Friday, 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. is the game,\u201d Xu said. \u201cWhen we started, I was so scared that it would be quiet on the weekends, but on Monday, people just come back.

The trajectory of this space reminds me a lot of the crypto world. While very different, they are both investing areas that had their 15 minutes of fame, but as they faded from the mainstream, they still kept dedicated and growing communities of people interested in their approach.\n\nStill, AfterHour is an especially smart idea because, as with crypto, there is much money to be made here \u2014 and just as much to lose. Such platforms can\u2019t guarantee their users will find financial success, but that doesn\u2019t mean average people should be fully locked out of the stock markets, which companies like Robinhood, and more recently Destiney Tech 100, have worked to democratize.\n\n\u201cThe big misconception in the valley was that retail trading was a fad in 2021, referencing the stimulus check,\u201d Xu said. \u201cIt\u2019s only growing.

Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday.\n\nElon Musk just convinced Tesla shareholders to approve his $56 billion pay package, making him the highest-paid CEO in history \u2014 assuming he can dodge a Delaware judge\u2019s disapproval. And where better to stage this circus than Texas, home of big everything, including egos? Shareholders erupted in applause at Tesla\u2019s Texas gigafactory when the vote results were announced. Meanwhile, Musk juggles more companies than a clown with chainsaws and faces two new lawsuits (being sued just once per week is for wimps). Oh, and forget about any fancy ESG initiatives; those got shot down faster than you can say \u201ccorporate responsibility.\u201d Who needs sustainability when you\u2019ve got Elon dancing onstage with 0.7 Twitter\u2019s worth of cash in a suitcase?\n\nMost interesting startup stories from the week\n\nIt seems Henrik Fisker\u2019s knack for designing cars is only matched by his talent for driving companies into bankruptcy. Despite aiming to be the Apple of EVs (with Magna playing Foxconn), the much-touted Ocean SUV sank faster than the Titanic with software glitches, recalls, and lemon lawsuits galore. Now filing for Chapter 11 in Delaware, Fisker has gone from dreams of revolutionizing the auto industry to just trying not to get stuck with a $500 million bill. This marks Fisker\u2019s second go of bankrupting an eponymous company. Can he make it to three? Stay tuned.\n\nYeah, saw that one coming : Ever feel like your subscription services are plotting against you?

Image Credits: Adobe\n\nTrend of the week: All eyes on AI\n\nApple has finally thrown its hat into the AI icon circus, joining the likes of Google and OpenAI in a desperate bid to depict AI with a logo that makes any sense at all. Spoiler alert: They\u2019re as clueless as everyone else. Apple\u2019s new visual for \u201cIntelligence\u201d is essentially a psychedelic circle \u2014 wait, no \u2014 a lopsided infinity symbol? Actually, it\u2019s New Siri. Or maybe it\u2019s when your phone edges glow like an alien spaceship landing. The real takeaway here? No one knows what AI should look like, but let\u2019s slap on some friendly pastel colors and call it innovation.\n\nMeanwhile, Ilya Sutskever, the AI brainiac who last month decided OpenAI wasn\u2019t exciting enough anymore, has started his own shindig called Safe Superintelligence Inc. (SSI) with a couple of other ex-OpenAI pals. After a dramatic exit from OpenAI (presumably over how to avoid Skynet taking over), Sutskever is doubling down on making sure super-smart AI doesn\u2019t become our overlord anytime soon. SSI\u2019s mission? To balance mind-blowing AI advancements with safety measures so we don\u2019t end up starring in our very own \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d episode.\n\nSure, that seems AI-y, doesn\u2019t it?

{"title": "Khosla-backed Marble, built by former Headway founders, offers affordable group therapy for teens", "text": "Rates of depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts are surging among U.S. teens.\n\nA recent report from the Center of Disease Control found that nearly one in three girls have seriously considered suicide, and a significant number, 13% have actually attempted it.\n\nPsychologists have various theories about what\u2019s causing adolescent mental health crises.\n\nSome blame the increased use of smartphones and social media, while others believe that the isolation during the pandemic has played a significant role.\n\nWhile the primary drivers of teen psychological difficulties are not well understood, the bigger challenge now is finding ways to solve the growing problem, given a nationwide shortage of mental health professionals.\n\nJake Sussman, who was one of the four co-founders of unicorn-size mental health network Headway, believes his new startup can help address the deepening crisis by offering online group therapy for children in grades five through 12.\n\nAfter leaving Headway two years ago, Sussman decided to try something entirely different. He became a fifth-grade English teacher at a charter school in Brooklyn. That experience not only gave him an opportunity to teach kids how to write essays but also gave him a front-row seat to why the mental health care for children is currently broken.\n\nSussman\u2019s school had one counselor, but despite that person\u2019s best effort, they often couldn\u2019t arrange timely help for students, he said.\n\n\u201c[Counselors] are not clinicians. They have massive caseloads,\u201d Sussman said. \u201cThe best they can do is give families physical PDFs of clinics that all have long wait lists.\u201d\n\nHe shared the story of Jamelia, an orphan who became depressed after her best friend left the school.

{"title": "Khosla-backed Marble, built by former Headway founders, offers affordable group therapy for teens", "text": "Rates of depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts are surging among U.S. teens.\n\nA recent report from the Center of Disease Control found that nearly one in three girls have seriously considered suicide, and a significant number, 13% have actually attempted it.\n\nPsychologists have various theories about what\u2019s causing adolescent mental health crises.\n\nSome blame the increased use of smartphones and social media, while others believe that the isolation during the pandemic has played a significant role.\n\nWhile the primary drivers of teen psychological difficulties are not well understood, the bigger challenge now is finding ways to solve the growing problem, given a nationwide shortage of mental health professionals.\n\nJake Sussman, who was one of the four co-founders of unicorn-size mental health network Headway, believes his new startup can help address the deepening crisis by offering online group therapy for children in grades five through 12.\n\nAfter leaving Headway two years ago, Sussman decided to try something entirely different. He became a fifth-grade English teacher at a charter school in Brooklyn. That experience not only gave him an opportunity to teach kids how to write essays but also gave him a front-row seat to why the mental health care for children is currently broken.\n\nSussman\u2019s school had one counselor, but despite that person\u2019s best effort, they often couldn\u2019t arrange timely help for students, he said.\n\n\u201c[Counselors] are not clinicians. They have massive caseloads,\u201d Sussman said. \u201cThe best they can do is give families physical PDFs of clinics that all have long wait lists.\u201d\n\nHe shared the story of Jamelia, an orphan who became depressed after her best friend left the school. Because Jamelia was covered by Medicaid, she had to wait three months to see a therapist.\n\nSussman realized that one way to solve the mental health professional shortage is to offer help in a group setting.\n\n\u201cGroup care has been around for a long time,\u201d Sussman said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been studied rigorously.

{"title": "Apple\u2019s App Store breaches EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act", "text": "A few months after opening a non-compliance case on Apple and the Digital Markets Act (DMA), the European Commission has shared its preliminary findings with Apple. And the bottom line is that the current App Store rules are in breach of the DMA. Confirmed violations of the DMA can lead to fines of up to 10% of global annual turnover.\n\n\u201c\u2018Act different\u2019 should be their new slogan,\u201d the EU\u2019s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, wrote on X. \u201cFor too long, Apple has been squeezing out innovative companies \u2014 denying consumers new opportunities & choices.\u201d\n\nIn this particular case, the European Commission believes third-party developers should be able to inform customers of alternative purchasing possibilities \u2014 free of charge.\n\nFor instance, developers who have released apps on the App Store can\u2019t advertise different prices or alternative distribution channels in their apps. While Apple now allows developers to include a link to their site, the European Commission believes there are too many restrictions with this link-out mechanism.\n\nEven if developers redirect users to their websites and handle transactions on their websites, they have to report transactions to Apple and pay a commission. Apple only waives a 3% payment processing fee for web purchases.\n\n\u201cApple has made a number of changes to comply with the DMA in response to feedback from developers and the European Commission,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe are confident our plan complies with the law, and estimate more than 99% of developers would pay the same or less in fees to Apple under the new business terms we created.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these preliminary findings, the European Commission is opening a third non-compliance investigation into Apple\u2019s new contractual terms for EU developers. This time, the Commission is going to focus on Apple\u2019s controversial Core Technology Fee (CTF) and alternative app marketplaces.\n\nEuropean developers can remain on the standard business terms or choose new business terms that allow them to distribute their apps outside of the App Store. However, these new terms lead to a \u20ac0.50 fee per installed app after one million downloads.\n\nThe company has already adjusted the CTF so that it doesn\u2019t apply to free non-commercial apps. There\u2019s also a three-year transition period for small developers that release a hit app and get more than one million downloads for the first time. But that doesn\u2019t change much in the long term. With this new formal investigation, the EC will determine whether the CTF effectively complies with the DMA.\n\nIf you\u2019ve tried to install a third-party app store in the EU, such as the AltStore, Setapp Mobile or Aptoide, you may have noticed that it requires quite a few taps. You first get an error in your web browser. You have to open the Settings app, accept app installations from this site, go back to your web browser, download the alternative store again, and accept popups about the risks involved with a third-party app store. The EC will examine this \u201cmulti-step user journey\u201d and its compliance with the DMA rules.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that Apple designed its new business model to discourage app developers and end users from taking advantage of the opportunities afforded to them by the DMA,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, the Commission EVP in charge of competition policy, said in a speech.\n\n\u201cThe letter of the DMA is clear: Gatekeepers have to allow for alternative app stores to establish themselves on their platform, and for consumers to be fully informed about the offers available to them so that they can freely choose where they want to source their apps, and at what conditions,\u201d she added.\n\nAs for today\u2019s preliminary findings, Apple can now respond to the European Commission in writing. The final decision is due one year after the opening of the formal investigation, which means that Apple can negotiate with the EU and adjust its business terms once again to avoid a hefty fine.", "authors": "['Romain Dillet']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2112138706.jpg?resize=1200,795", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/24/apples-app-store-breaches-eus-digital-markets-act/", "timestamp": "1719367342.2849028", "displayed": 0}
{"title": "Silicon Valley leaders are once again declaring \u2018DEI\u2019 bad and \u2018meritocracy\u2019 good \u2014 but they\u2019re wrong", "text": "No, Silicon Valley, a \u2018meritocracy\u2019 is not better than DEI, according to the data\n\nWho\u2019s afraid of the Big Bad DEI? The acronym is near-poisonous now \u2014 a word that creates almost instant tension between those who embrace it and those who want it dead.\n\nA prime example of this divide was the response to startup Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang\u2019s post on X last week. He wrote about moving away from DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) to instead embrace \u201cMEI\u201d \u2014 merit, excellence, and intelligence.\n\n\u201cScale is a meritocracy, and we must always remain one,\u201d Wang wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal whenever we invite someone to join our mission, and those decisions have never been swayed by orthodoxy or virtue signaling or whatever the current thing is.\u201d\n\nToday we\u2019ve formalized an important hiring policy at Scale. We hire for MEI: merit, excellence, and intelligence.\n\n\n\nThis is the email I\u2019ve shared with our @scale_AI team.\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\nMERITOCRACY AT SCALE\n\n\n\nIn the wake of our fundraise, I\u2019ve been getting a lot of questions\u2026 \u2014 Alexandr Wang (@alexandr_wang) June 13, 2024\n\nThe commenters on X \u2014 which included Elon Musk, Palmer Luckey, and Brian Armstrong \u2014 were thrilled. On LinkedIn, however, the startup community gave a less-than-enthusiastic response. Those commenters pointed out that Wang\u2019s post made it seem as if \u201cmeritocracy\u201d was the definitive benchmark to find qualified hiring candidates \u2014 without taking into consideration that the idea of meritocracy is itself subjective. In the days that have followed the post, more and more people have shared their thoughts and what Wang\u2019s comments reveal about the current state of DEI in tech.\n\n\u201cThe post is misguided because people who support the meritocracy argument are ignoring the structural reasons some groups are more likely to outperform others,\u201d Mutale Nkonde, a founder working in AI policy, told TechCrunch. \u201dWe all want the best people for the job, and there is data to prove that diverse teams are more effective.\u201d\n\nEmily Witko, an HR professional at AI startup Hugging Face, told TechCrunch that the post was a \u201cdangerous oversimplification,\u201d but that it received so much attention on X because it \u201copenly expressed sentiments that are not always expressed publicly and the audience there is hungry to attack DEI.\u201d Wang\u2019s MEI thought \u201cmakes it so easy to refute or criticize any conversations regarding the importance of acknowledging underrepresentation in tech,\u201d she continued.\n\nBut Wang is far from the only Silicon Valley insider to attack DEI in recent months. He joins a chorus of those who feel that DEI programs implemented at businesses over the past several years, peaking with the Black Lives Matter movement, caused a backslide in corporate profitability \u2014 and that a return to \u201cmeritocratic principles\u201d is overdue. Indeed, much of the tech industry has worked to dismantle recruitment programs that considered candidates who, under previous hiring regimes, were often overlooked in the hiring process.\n\nSeeking to make a change, in 2020, many organizations and power players came together to promise more of a focus on DEI, which, contrary to the mainstream discussion, is not simply about hiring someone based on the color of their skin but is about ensuring qualified people from all walks of life \u2014 regardless of skin, gender, or ethnic background \u2014 are better represented and included in recruitment funnels. It\u2019s also about taking a look at disparities and pipeline issues, analyzing the reasoning behind why certain candidates are constantly overlooked in a hiring process.\n\nIn 2023, the U.S. data industry saw new women recruit levels drop by two-thirds, from 36% in 2022 to just 12%, according to a report from HR staffing firm Harnham. Meanwhile, the percentage of Black, Indigenous, and professionals of color in VP or above data roles stood at just 38% in 2022.\n\nAlexandr Wang (pictured above) caused a stir on social media when he posted about meritocracy in tech on X. Image Credits: Drew Angerer / Staff / Getty Images\n\nDEI-related job listings have also fallen out of favor, declining 44% in 2023, according to data from the job site Indeed. In the AI industry, a recent Deloitte survey of women found that over half said they ended up leaving at least one employer because of how men and women were treated differently, while 73% considered leaving the tech industry altogether due to unequal pay and an inability to advance in their careers.\n\nYet, for an industry that prides itself on being data-driven, Silicon Valley cannot let the idea of a meritocracy go \u2014 despite all the data and research showing how such thinking is just a belief system and one that can lead to biased outcomes. The idea of going out and hiring \u201cthe best person for the job\u201d without taking into account any human sociology is how pattern-matching occurs \u2014 teams and companies of people who are alike, when the research has long shown that more diverse teams perform better. Moreover, it has only raised suspicions about who the Valley considers excellent and why.\n\nExperts we spoke to said this subjectiveness revealed other issues with Wang\u2019s missive \u2014 mostly that he presents MEI as a revolutionary idea and not one that Silicon Valley and most of corporate America have long embraced. The acronym \u201cMEI\u201d appears to be a scornful nod to DEI, intended to drive home the notion that a company must choose between hiring diverse candidates or candidates that meet certain \u201cobjective\u201d qualifications.\n\nNatalie Sue Johnson, co-founder of the DEI consulting firm Paradigm, told TechCrunch that research has shown meritocracy to be a paradox and that organizations that focus too much on it actually see an increase in bias. \u201cIt frees people up from thinking that they have to try hard to be fair in their decision-making,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey think that meritocracy is inherent, not something that needs to be achieved.\u201d\n\nAs Nkonde mentioned, Johnson noted that Wang\u2019s approach doesn\u2019t acknowledge that underrepresented groups face systemic barriers society is still struggling to address. Ironically, the most meritorious person could be the one who has achieved a skill set for a job despite such barriers that may have influenced their educational background or prevented them from filling their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with the kind of college internships that impresses Silicon Valley.\n\nTreating a person as a faceless, nameless candidate, without understanding their unique experiences, and therefore their employability, is a mistake, Johnson said. \u201cThere is nuance.\u201d\n\nWitko added to that: \u201cA meritocratic system is built on criteria that reflect the status quo, and therefore, it will perpetuate existing inequalities by continuously favoring those who already have advantages.\u201d\n\nTo be somewhat charitable to Wang, given how acidic the term DEI has become, developing a new term that still represents the value of fairness to all candidates, isn\u2019t a terrible idea \u2014 even if \u201cmeritocracy\u201d is misguided. And his post suggests that Scale AI\u2019s values could align with the spirit of diversity, equity, and inclusion even if he might not realize it, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cCasting a wide net for talent and making objective hiring decisions that do not disadvantage candidates based on identity is exactly what diversity, equity, and inclusion work seeks to do,\u201d she explained.\n\nBut again, where Wang undermines this is endorsing the mistaken belief that meritocracy will produce outcomes based on one\u2019s abilities and merits alone.\n\nPerhaps it is all a paradox. If one looks at Scale AI\u2019s treatment of its data annotators \u2014 many of whom live in economically depressed countries and scrape by on little pay \u2014 it suggests the company has scant real interest in disrupting the status quo.\n\nScale AI\u2019s annotators work on tasks for multiple eight-hour workdays \u2014 no breaks \u2014 for pay ranging as low as $10 (per the Verge and NY Mag). It\u2019s on the backs of these annotators that Scale AI has built a business worth over $13 billion and with more than $1.6 billion in cash in the bank.\n\nWhen asked for comment on the allegations made in the Verge and NY Mag piece, a spokesperson pointed to this blog post, in which it described its human annotator jobs as \u201cgig work.\u201d The spokesperson didn\u2019t address TechCrunch\u2019s request for clarification on Scale AI\u2019s MEI policy.\n\nJohnson said Wang\u2019s post is a great example of the box many leaders and companies find themselves trapped in.\n\nShe pondered, can they trust that having meritocratic ideals is enough to lead to truly meritocratic outcomes, and promote diversity?\n\n\u201cOr,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cdo they acknowledge that ideals are not enough, and to truly build more diverse workforces where everyone has the same access to opportunities and can do their best work requires intention?\u201d", "authors": "['Dominic-Madori Davis', 'Kyle Wiggers']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DEI-big-bad-wolf.jpg?resize=1200,645", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/23/silicon-valley-leaders-are-once-again-declaring-dei-bad-and-meritocracy-good-but-theyre-wrong/", "timestamp": "1719367343.979248", "displayed": 0}

{"title": "iOS 18 could \u2018sherlock\u2019 $400M in app revenue", "text": "Apple\u2019s practice of leveraging ideas from its third-party developer community to become new iOS and Mac features and apps has a hefty price tag, a new report indicates. With the release of iOS 18 later this fall, Apple\u2019s changes may affect apps that today have an estimated $393 million in revenue and have been downloaded roughly 58 million times over the past year, according to an analysis by app intelligence firm Appfigures.\n\nEvery June at Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference, the iPhone maker teases the upcoming releases of its software and operating systems, which often include features previously only available through third-party apps. The practice is so common now it\u2019s even been given a name: \u201csherlocking\u201d \u2014 a reference to a 1990s search app for Mac that borrowed features from a third-party app known as Watson. Now when Apple launches a new feature that was before the domain of a third-party app, it\u2019s said to have \u201csherlocked\u201d the app.\n\nIn earlier years, sherlocking apps made some sense. After all, did the iPhone\u2019s flashlight really need to be a third-party offering, or would it be better as a built-in function? Plus, Apple has been able to launch features that made its software better adapted to consumers\u2019 wants and needs by looking at what\u2019s popular among the third-party developer community.\n\nOf course, this practice also raises the question as to whether Apple is leveraging proprietary data to make its determinations about what to build next, and whether the apps it competes with are being offered an even playing field. For example, before Apple launched its own parental controls system, it shut down many third-party apps that had built businesses in this space by saying their solutions were now noncompliant with its rules and policies. The apps weren\u2019t offered access to a developer API for managing Apple\u2019s built-in parental controls for years, prompting an antitrust investigation.\n\nIn more recent years, Apple has \u201csherlocked\u201d third parties with launches of features like Continuity Camera, medication tracking, sleep tracking and mood tracking, as well as apps like Freeform and Journal. This year, it turned its attention to password managers, call recording and transcription apps, those for making custom emoji, AI-powered writing tools and math helpers, trail apps and more.\n\nIn an analysis of third-party apps that generated more than 1,000 downloads per year, Appfigures discovered several genres that had found themselves in Apple\u2019s crosshairs in 2024.\n\nIn terms of worldwide gross revenue, these categories have generated significant income over the past 12 months, with the trail app category making the most at $307 million per year, led by market leader and 2023 Apple \u201cApp of the Year\u201d AllTrails. Grammar helper apps, like Grammarly and others, also generated $35.7 million, while math helpers and password managers earned $23.4 million and $20.3 million, respectively. Apps for making custom emoji generated $7 million, too.\n\nImage Credits: Appfigures\n\nOf these, trail apps accounted for the vast majority of \u201cpotentially sherlocked\u201d revenue, or 78%, noted Appfigures, as well as 40% of downloads of sherlocked apps. In May 2024, they accounted for an estimated $28.8 million in gross consumer spending and 2.5 million downloads, to give you an idea of scale.\n\nMany of these app categories were growing quickly, with math solvers having seen revenue growth of 43% year-over-year followed by grammar helpers (+40%), password managers (+38%) and trail apps (+28%). Emoji-making apps, however, were seeing declines at -17% year-over-year.\n\nImage Credits: Appfigures\n\nBy downloads, grammar helpers had seen 9.4 million installs over the past 12 months, followed by emoji makers (10.6 million), math-solving apps (9.5 million) and password managers (457,000 installs).\n\nAlthough these apps certainly have dedicated user bases that may not immediately choose to switch to a first-party offering, Apple\u2019s ability to offer similar functionality built-in could be detrimental to their potential growth. Casual users may be satisfied by Apple\u2019s \u201cgood enough\u201d solutions and won\u2019t seek out alternatives.\n\nHowever, apps that continue to develop new features and add enhancements beyond what Apple includes while also taking advantage of other new ways to reach users, like through Apple\u2019s improved Siri, may have a better shot than others.", "authors": "['Sarah Perez']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/app-store-2024-v1.jpg?resize=1200,675", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/18/ios-18-could-sherlock-400m-in-app-revenue/", "timestamp": "1719367346.9252532", "displayed": 0}

The goal is to have the new tool in place and ready to use by 2025.\n\nOpenAI explores allowing AI porn\n\nIn a new peek behind the curtain of its AI\u2019s secret instructions, OpenAI also released a new NSFW policy. Though it\u2019s intended to start a conversation about how it might allow explicit images and text in its AI products, it raises questions about whether OpenAI \u2014 or any generative AI vendor \u2014 can be trusted to handle sensitive content ethically.\n\nOpenAI and Stack Overflow announce partnership\n\nIn a new partnership, OpenAI will get access to developer platform Stack Overflow\u2019s API and will get feedback from developers to improve the performance of their AI models. In return, OpenAI will include attributions to Stack Overflow in ChatGPT.

You won\u2019t be able to save or share chats, use custom instructions, or other features associated with a persistent account. This version of ChatGPT will have \u201cslightly more restrictive content policies,\u201d according to OpenAI. When TechCrunch asked for more details, however, the response was unclear:\n\n\u201cThe signed out experience will benefit from the existing safety mitigations that are already built into the model, such as refusing to generate harmful content. In addition to these existing mitigations, we are also implementing additional safeguards specifically designed to address other forms of content that may be inappropriate for a signed out experience,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\nMarch 2024\n\nOpenAI\u2019s chatbot store is filling up with spam\n\nTechCrunch found that the OpenAI\u2019s GPT Store is flooded with bizarre, potentially copyright-infringing GPTs. A cursory search pulls up GPTs that claim to generate art in the style of Disney and Marvel properties, but serve as little more than funnels to third-party paid services and advertise themselves as being able to bypass AI content detection tools.\n\nThe New York Times responds to OpenAI\u2019s claims that it \u201chacked\u201d ChatGPT for its copyright lawsuit\n\nIn a court filing opposing OpenAI\u2019s motion to dismiss The New York Times\u2019 lawsuit alleging copyright infringement, the newspaper asserted that \u201cOpenAI\u2019s attention-grabbing claim that The Times \u2018hacked\u2019 its products is as irrelevant as it is false.\u201d The New York Times also claimed that some users of ChatGPT used the tool to bypass its paywalls.\n\nOpenAI VP doesn\u2019t say whether artists should be paid for training data\n\nAt a SXSW 2024 panel, Peter Deng, OpenAI\u2019s VP of consumer product dodged a question on whether artists whose work was used to train generative AI models should be compensated. While OpenAI lets artists \u201copt out\u201d of and remove their work from the datasets that the company uses to train its image-generating models, some artists have described the tool as onerous.\n\nA new report estimates that ChatGPT uses more than half a million kilowatt-hours of electricity per day\n\nChatGPT\u2019s environmental impact appears to be massive. According to a report from The New Yorker, ChatGPT uses an estimated 17,000 times the amount of electricity than the average U.S. household to respond to roughly 200 million requests each day.\n\nChatGPT can now read its answers aloud\n\nOpenAI released a new Read Aloud feature for the web version of ChatGPT as well as the iOS and Android apps.

How does it work?\n\nChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.\n\nWhen did ChatGPT get released?\n\nNovember 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.\n\nWhat is the latest version of ChatGPT?\n\nBoth the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.\n\nCan I use ChatGPT for free?\n\nThere is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.\n\nWho uses ChatGPT?\n\nAnyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.\n\nWhat companies use ChatGPT?\n\nMultiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.\n\nMost recently, Microsoft announced at it\u2019s 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.\n\nWhat does GPT mean in ChatGPT?\n\nGPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.\n\nWhat is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?\n\nA chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they\u2019ll give canned responses to questions.\n\nChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.\n\nCan ChatGPT write essays?\n\nYes.\n\nCan ChatGPT commit libel?\n\nDue to the nature of how these models work, they don\u2019t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That\u2019s a problem when you\u2019re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn\u2019t commit, that may well at this point be libel.\n\nWe will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.\n\nDoes ChatGPT have an app?\n\nYes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.\n\nWhat is the ChatGPT character limit?\n\nIt\u2019s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.\n\nDoes ChatGPT have an API?\n\nYes, it was released March 1, 2023.\n\nWhat are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?\n\nEveryday examples include programing, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.\n\nWhat are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?\n\nAdvanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.\n\nHow good is ChatGPT at writing code?\n\nIt depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can\u2019t necessarily program an entire app\u2019s worth of code. That\u2019s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness \u2014 in other words, the generated code isn\u2019t always appropriate for the specific context in which it\u2019s being used.\n\nCan you save a ChatGPT chat?\n\nYes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.\n\nAre there alternatives to ChatGPT?\n\nYes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google\u2019s Gemini and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.\n\nHow does ChatGPT handle data privacy?\n\nOpenAI has said that individuals in \u201ccertain jurisdictions\u201d (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression \u201cin accordance with applicable laws\u201d.\n\nThe web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled \u201cOpenAI Personal Data Removal Request\u201d.\n\nIn its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on \u201clegitimate interest\u201d (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out \u2014 when it writes: \u201cSee here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.\u201d\n\nWhat controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?\n\nRecently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI\u2019s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.\n\nAn Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT\u2019s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.\n\nCNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.\n\nSeveral major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.\n\nThere have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.\n\nWhere can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?\n\nSeveral marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.\n\nCan ChatGPT be detected?\n\nPoorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they\u2019re inconsistent at best.\n\nAre ChatGPT chats public?\n\nNo. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users\u2019 conversations to other people on the service.\n\nWhat lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?\n\nNone specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.\n\nAre there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?\n\nYes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.", "authors": "['Kyle Wiggers', 'Cody Corrall', 'Alyssa Stringer']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1462188043.jpg?resize=1200,798", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/17/chatgpt-everything-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot/", "timestamp": "1719367352.4658701", "displayed": 0}
{"title": "Perplexity Is a Bullshit Machine", "text": "Considering Perplexity\u2019s bold ambition and the investment it\u2019s taken from Jeff Bezos\u2019 family fund, Nvidia, and famed investor Balaji Srinivasan, among others, it\u2019s surprisingly unclear what the AI search startup actually is.\n\nEarlier this year, speaking to WIRED, Aravind Srinivas, Perplexity\u2019s CEO, described his product\u2014a chatbot that gives natural-language answers to prompts and can, the company says, access the internet in real time\u2014as an \u201canswer engine.\u201d A few weeks later, shortly before a funding round valuing the company at a billion dollars was announced, he told Forbes, \u201cIt\u2019s almost like Wikipedia and ChatGPT had a kid.\u201d More recently, after Forbes accused Perplexity of plagiarizing its content, Srinivas told the AP it was a mere \u201caggregator of information.\u201d\n\nThe Perplexity chatbot itself is more specific. Prompted to describe what Perplexity is, it provides text that reads, \u201cPerplexity AI is an AI-powered search engine that combines features of traditional search engines and chatbots. It provides concise, real-time answers to user queries by pulling information from recent articles and indexing the web daily.\u201d\n\nA WIRED analysis and one carried out by developer Robb Knight suggest that Perplexity is able to achieve this partly through apparently ignoring a widely accepted web standard known as the Robots Exclusion Protocol to surreptitiously scrape areas of websites that operators do not want accessed by bots, despite claiming that it won\u2019t. WIRED observed a machine tied to Perplexity\u2014more specifically, one on an Amazon server and almost certainly operated by Perplexity\u2014doing this on WIRED.com and across other Cond\u00e9 Nast publications.\n\nThe WIRED analysis also demonstrates that, despite claims that Perplexity\u2019s tools provide \u201cinstant, reliable answers to any question with complete sources and citations included,\u201d doing away with the need to \u201cclick on different links,\u201d its chatbot, which is capable of accurately summarizing journalistic work with appropriate credit, is also prone to bullshitting, in the technical sense of the word.\n\nWIRED provided the Perplexity chatbot with the headlines of dozens of articles published on our website this year, as well as prompts about the subjects of WIRED reporting. The results showed the chatbot at times closely paraphrasing WIRED stories, and at times summarizing stories inaccurately and with minimal attribution.

According to server logs, that same IP visited properties belonging to Cond\u00e9 Nast, the media company that owns WIRED, at least 822 times in the past three months\u2014likely a significant undercount, because the company retains only a small portion of its records.\n\nWe also reported that the chatbot was bullshitting, in the technical sense.

{"title": "Microsoft\u2019s Mustafa Suleyman says he loves Sam Altman, believes he\u2019s sincere about AI safety", "text": "In an interview at the Aspen Ideas Festival on Tuesday, Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, made it very clear that he admires OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\nCNBC\u2019s Andrew Ross Sorkin asked what the plan will be when Microsoft\u2019s enormous AI future isn\u2019t so closely dependent on OpenAI, using a metaphor of winning a bicycling race. But Suleyman sidestepped.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t buy the metaphor that there is a finish line. This is another false frame,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to stop framing everything as a ferocious race.\u201d\n\nHe then proceeded to toe the Microsoft corporate line about his company\u2019s arrangement with OpenAI, in which it invested a reported $10 billion through some combination of cash and cloud credits. The deal gives Microsoft a big stake in OpenAI\u2019s for-profit business, and allows it to embed its AI models into Microsoft wares and sell its tech to Microsoft cloud customers. Some reports indicate that Microsoft may also be entitled to some OpenAI payments.\n\n\u201cIt is true that we have ferocious competition with them,\u201d Suleyman said about OpenAI. \u201cThey are an independent company. We don\u2019t own or control them. We don\u2019t even have any board members. So they do entirely their own thing. But we have a deep partnership. I\u2019m very good friends with Sam, have huge respect and, trust and faith in what they\u2019ve done. And that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to roll for many, many years to come,\u201d Suleyman said.\n\nThis close/distant relationship is important for Suleyman to profess. Microsoft\u2019s investors and enterprise customers appreciate the close relationship. But regulators did get curious and in April, the EU agreed that its investment was not a true takeover. Should that change, in all likelihood so would the regulatory involvement.\n\nSuleyman says he trusts Altman on AI safety\n\nIn a sense, Suleyman was the Sam Altman of AI before OpenAI. He has spent most of his career in competition with OpenAI, and is known for his own ego.\n\nSuleyman was the founder of AI pioneer DeepMind and sold it to Google in 2014. He was reportedly put on administrative leave following allegations of bullying employees, as Bloomberg reported in 2019, then moved to other Google roles before leaving the company in 2022 to join Greylock Partners as a venture partner. A few months later, he and Greylock\u2019s Reid Hoffman, a Microsoft board member, launched Inflection AI to build its own LLM chatbot, among other goals.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella tried but failed to hire Sam Altman last fall, when OpenAI fired him and then quickly reinstated him. After that, Microsoft hired Suleyman and much of Inflection in March, leaving a shell of a company and a big check. In his new role at Microsoft, Suleyman has been auditing OpenAI code, Semafor reported earlier this month. As one of OpenAI\u2019s previous big rivals, he\u2019s now getting to dive deep inside the crown-jewel frenemy competitor.\n\nThere\u2019s yet another wrinkle to all of this.

{"title": "Microsoft\u2019s Mustafa Suleyman says he loves Sam Altman, believes he\u2019s sincere about AI safety", "text": "In an interview at the Aspen Ideas Festival on Tuesday, Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, made it very clear that he admires OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\nCNBC\u2019s Andrew Ross Sorkin asked what the plan will be when Microsoft\u2019s enormous AI future isn\u2019t so closely dependent on OpenAI, using a metaphor of winning a bicycling race. But Suleyman sidestepped.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t buy the metaphor that there is a finish line. This is another false frame,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to stop framing everything as a ferocious race.\u201d\n\nHe then proceeded to toe the Microsoft corporate line about his company\u2019s arrangement with OpenAI, in which it invested a reported $10 billion through some combination of cash and cloud credits. The deal gives Microsoft a big stake in OpenAI\u2019s for-profit business, and allows it to embed its AI models into Microsoft wares and sell its tech to Microsoft cloud customers. Some reports indicate that Microsoft may also be entitled to some OpenAI payments.\n\n\u201cIt is true that we have ferocious competition with them,\u201d Suleyman said about OpenAI. \u201cThey are an independent company. We don\u2019t own or control them. We don\u2019t even have any board members. So they do entirely their own thing. But we have a deep partnership. I\u2019m very good friends with Sam, have huge respect and, trust and faith in what they\u2019ve done. And that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to roll for many, many years to come,\u201d Suleyman said.\n\nThis close/distant relationship is important for Suleyman to profess. Microsoft\u2019s investors and enterprise customers appreciate the close relationship. But regulators did get curious and in April, the EU agreed that its investment was not a true takeover. Should that change, in all likelihood so would the regulatory involvement.\n\nSuleyman says he trusts Altman on AI safety\n\nIn a sense, Suleyman was the Sam Altman of AI before OpenAI. He has spent most of his career in competition with OpenAI, and is known for his own ego.\n\nSuleyman was the founder of AI pioneer DeepMind and sold it to Google in 2014. He was reportedly put on administrative leave following allegations of bullying employees, as Bloomberg reported in 2019, then moved to other Google roles before leaving the company in 2022 to join Greylock Partners as a venture partner. A few months later, he and Greylock\u2019s Reid Hoffman, a Microsoft board member, launched Inflection AI to build its own LLM chatbot, among other goals.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella tried but failed to hire Sam Altman last fall, when OpenAI fired him and then quickly reinstated him. After that, Microsoft hired Suleyman and much of Inflection in March, leaving a shell of a company and a big check. In his new role at Microsoft, Suleyman has been auditing OpenAI code, Semafor reported earlier this month. As one of OpenAI\u2019s previous big rivals, he\u2019s now getting to dive deep inside the crown-jewel frenemy competitor.\n\nThere\u2019s yet another wrinkle to all of this. OpenAI was founded with a premise of doing AI safety research, to stop a one-day evil AI from destroying humankind. In 2023, when he was still an OpenAI competitor, Suleyman released a book called \u201cThe Coming Wave: Technology, Power and the 21st Century\u2019s Greatest Dilemma\u201d with researcher Michael Bhaskar.

But giving them actual, living skin that can be manipulated into horrifying, slimy expressions? That\u2019s new.\n\nThe new work, published in the journal Cell Reports Physical Science, is very much just an experiment. This will not be the face of your next smart home hub or vacuum.\n\nBut it may well be that the ingenious machinery produced by billions of years of evolution may be better in some situations than artificial skin (also very much in development) or simpler surfaces. This brings up several questions \u2014 many, in fact, but only one is really the topic of the paper, as is proper in scientific inquiry.\n\nTo wit: How would such a living tissue surface, whatever its advantages and disadvantages, attach to the mechanical foundation of a robot\u2019s limb or \u201cface\u201d?\n\nIn humans and other animals, there is a network of ligaments that anchors the skin to underlying muscle and tissue. This works pretty well, I\u2019ve found. And the researchers at the University of Tokyo and Harvard wanted to test whether they could create a version of this that let living skin both cling closely to an artificial substrate, and also be manipulated in various directions without tearing or unintended distortion.\n\nHow did their \u201cdermis equivalent\u201d turn out? I\u2019ll let you be the judge:\n\nImage Credits: University of Tokyo\n\nAh, nightmare fuel. But you can\u2019t accuse it of being anything less than well-moisturized.\n\nOf course it\u2019s horrifying now, but it\u2019s not intended to be realistic or beautiful \u2014 just to illustrate a potential method for attachment of living tissue to robotic undercarriage.\n\nYes, that is in fact exactly what a Terminator T-100 model has, but let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. Skin-covered robots could do all kinds of useful stuff in addition to infiltrating the past to destroy humanity\u2019s future.\n\nCultured skin, as they put it, can heal itself, carry biological sensors like our own to provide sensitive touch, and could also have benefits in medical or human interaction contexts.\n\nBut only if it can stay alive on there and also be moved around in the same ways our own skin is during everyday use.

{"title": "Fearless Fund\u2019s founder has resigned, and it\u2019s a sad reflection on the VC world for Black women", "text": "On Monday, Fearless Fund\u2019s co-founder Ayana Parsons announced that she was stepping down from her leadership role from the firm. She will no longer be its general partner and COO but will be off \u201cenjoying island life\u201d with her family, she said in a LinkedIn post. She co-founded the fund in 2019 with partner Arian Simone, who remains its CEO.\n\nFearless Fund was founded with a mission to provide venture capital financing, grants and financial education to startups founded by Black women. That\u2019s a demographic that is both particularly underserved and promising. Less than 1% of all VC dollars in 2023 went to Black-founded startups, which amounts to around $661 million out of $136 billion, according to Crunchbase data.\n\nSo Fearless Fund is doing exactly what venture capitalists are supposed to do: find an overlooked area (in Silicon Valley they might call it taking a \u201ccontrarian view\u201d) and invest. The fund has so far invested $26 million into over 40 companies that include Slutty Vegan, The Lip Bar, Partake Foods, and Live Tinted, Atlanta Daily World reports.\n\nThe money invested and granted is from private limited partners. The LPs who supported the fund want to support this thesis. The companies receiving money are still private startups. Since so little classic VC funding is going to these businesses, the community is building their own rails. Everyone in this ecosystem is OK with this.\n\nStill, it is being sued by a politically conservative group called the American Alliance for Equal Rights (AAER) over its charitable grants program. AAER is challenging the fund\u2019s right to provide $20,000 in small business grants to Black women, claiming the program violates the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which bans the use of race in contracts.\n\nAAER was founded by Edward Blum, an activist who helped successfully overturn affirmative action in universities and is now conducting several other lawsuits in similar veins (e.g., the AAER is currently suing the Smithsonian Institute\u2019s Latino Museum Studies Program for hiring Latino interns).\n\nThe case is not going particularly well for Fearless Fund. As TechCrunch recently reported, earlier this month an appeals court ruled against Fearless. It upheld a preliminary injunction that prevents the firm from making grants to Black women business owners. The firm told TechCrunch at that time it is weighing its options on how to proceed.\n\nLast year, when the case made national news, numerous founders and investors told TechCrunch about the infuriating irony of using the Civil Rights Act of 1866 to protest the firm\u2019s program, as it was initially put into place to help the formerly enslaved and is now being used against the community it sought to help.\n\nIn the months that followed, the frustration of this case within the community has not lessened. Earlier on Monday, Parsons had an emotional moment onstage at the ForbesBLK Summit in Atlanta. She was joined by political leader Stacey Abrams and the chief diversity officer of Congress, Dr. Sesha Joi Moon.\n\n\u201cAnytime you are surrounded by Black women, they are going to pour into you,\u2019\u2019 Parsons said, according to Forbes. \u201cSo, when I walked on this stage, these eyes were watering because they understood the heavy burden that is on all of us in this country.\u2019\u2019\n\nAfter announcing her resignation, Parsons told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and her spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the lawsuit against Fearless was not a motivating factor. But she did not otherwise explain her decision to leave. She also remains an investor in the fund. \u201cAs co-founder, Ayana is still an investor and she has always had multiple ventures centered around inclusion leadership and development, venture capital, and entrepreneurship. Fearless Fund is merely one avenue in her pursuit to be an advocate for the marginalized,\u201d her spokesperson said.\n\nParsons said in her LinkedIn post that she founded the firm \u201cto help change the game for women of color entrepreneurs. And my rationale was simple: women of color are the most founded yet the least funded. They are starting businesses at a faster rate than any other demographic yet lack access to the capital, resources, education and networks needed to scale their businesses.\u201d\n\nShe also promised not to give up on her goal. \u201cI remain steadfast in my support of and commitment to the advancement of women of color,\u201d she said in an emailed statement, mentioning that she\u2019ll soon be publishing a book, too.\n\nStill, as we previously pointed out, the sad fact is that big names in the tech ecosystem have not exactly come out swinging in support. CEO Simone told Inc. earlier this year that the fund had lost nearly all its partnerships aside from two, JPMorgan and Costco. Even Mastercard, who sponsored the now-contested Strivers Grant, has publicly never commented on the lawsuit.\n\nIndeed, support for anything considered DEI has done a complete pendulum swing in tech in 2024, from its height in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd. Currently, it has become more in vogue to publicly pan DEI and praise the so-called meritocracy.\n\nThis story was updated to include statements from Parsons and her public relations representative.", "authors": "['Julie Bort', 'Dominic-Madori Davis']", "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Kk3VUxfA-e1687456679564.jpg?resize=1200,717", "keywords": "[]", "summary": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/fearless-fund-founder-resigned-vc-venture-capital-startups-black-women/", "timestamp": "1719367384.3995352", "displayed": 0}

OpenAI\u2019s popular AI chatbot is available to all macOS users, the company announced on Tuesday. The app was first announced ahead of Apple\u2019s WWDC 2024 in June, where the companies jointly announced integrations between OpenAI\u2019s chatbot and Apple\u2019s operating systems for iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\nOn the latter platform, users can quickly call up ChatGPT by using the keyboard combination of Option + Space after installing the new ChatGPT app.\n\nThe ChatGPT desktop app for macOS is now available for all users.\n\n\n\nGet faster access to ChatGPT to chat about email, screenshots, and anything on your screen with the Option + Space shortcut: https://t.co/2rEx3PmMqg pic.twitter.com/x9sT8AnjDm \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) June 25, 2024\n\nThis makes access to the AI chatbot something that will immediately feel familiar to macOS users who regularly use other keyboard shortcuts like Command + Space to pop up a search bar to access Spotlight Search. But instead of more traditional search, they\u2019ll have access to a wider world of knowledge, only one button away. Once launched, ChatGPT appears as a chat interface overlaid on top of the screen.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s launch of the macOS app was a bit overshadowed at the time of the original announcement, as it arrived alongside GPT-4o, its flagship generative AI model that promises more advanced intelligence, including the ability to handle not only text and speech but also video. (Its multimodal capabilities and ability to understand media give the AI model its name; the \u201co\u201d stands for \u201comni.\u201d)\n\nChatGPT\u2019s desktop app was announced in the same press release, as a new app for both free and paid users. The company noted at the time that it could be called up with the simple keyboard shortcut and users could also take and discuss screenshots directly in the app. Users can upload files and other photos via the macOS app, too, as well as speak to ChatGPT from their desktop and search through their past conversations.\n\nThe app had been slowly rolling out to Mac users, starting with Plus subscribers, but today the company announced in a post on X that it\u2019s now available to everyone.\n\nThis isn\u2019t OpenAI\u2019s only integration with Apple devices. At WWDC, the companies announced a more expansive deal that will also see Apple customers gaining access to ChatGPT from their iPhones and iPads, including through Siri and within other areas that could be aided by AI, like Writing Tools.
