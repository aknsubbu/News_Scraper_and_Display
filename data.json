        "title": "Confluent acquires streaming data startup WarpStream",
        "text": "Streaming data and Kafka specialist Confluent on Monday announced that it has acquired WarpStream, a Kafka-compatible streaming data solution. Confluent plans to use WarpStream\u2019s cloud-native solution to fill out its portfolio by offering a new service (Confluent WarpStream) that can sit in between its fully managed Confluent Cloud and self-managed Confluent Platform.\n\nAs Confluent co-founder and CEO Jay Kreps told me, he thinks that what sits in between those two existing models is what he calls the \u201cbring your own cloud\u201d (BYOC) model.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a set of people who want some self-managed piece of software. They\u2019re going to go around themselves,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a set of people who want a fully managed cloud. But in some of these organizations, there\u2019s a set of use cases that either have requirements around the data in their environment not being able to leave or just need a fair amount of customization that leaves them doing everything themselves, which is not ideal. So this kind of \u2018bring your own cloud\u2019 is like a nice middle position where you can have something that\u2019s like a cloud offering, but it could be in your environment with a fair amount of control.\u201d\n\nImage Credits: Confluent\n\nWarpStream, Kreps said, built the right product for this market, and while Confluent could\u2019ve tried to adapt one of its products for these users, he didn\u2019t think that this approach would work well. \u201cWe feel this kind of completes the set of offerings. And this has been one of our beliefs for streaming: Since customers need it across such a broad set of use cases, you have to have the full portfolio of offerings if you really want to get all the streams of data and actually make it useful for customers,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also noted that nobody wants to adopt a new protocol for different data streaming use cases. The market, for the most part, has standardized on Kafka, even if the underlying technology continues to evolve. That\u2019s true for WarpStream as well, which Kreps noted has done a good job establishing itself with users in the observability, logging and IoT spaces.\n\nImage Credits: Confluent\n\nConfluent also hopes that WarpStream will offer some of the customers who are using and managing their own open source Kafka systems an easy on-ramp onto its platforms.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited that the leader in the data streaming space has acquired WarpStream to offer next-gen BYOC to customers,\u201d said Richard Artoul, co-founder and CEO, WarpStream. \u201cTogether with Confluent, we will continue to ensure that Kafka-compatible data streaming is accessible to every organization.\u201d\n\nWarpStream launched just over a year ago and had a team of 13 at the time of the acquisition. In Monday\u2019s announcement, Artoul describes how Kreps reached out to him shortly after the company launched. \u201cOver the next few months we met with more people at Confluent to determine if there was a path forward for WarpStream to exist under the Confluent umbrella, and today we\u2019re happy to announce that we\u2019ve found one,\u201d he writes.\n\nClearly, there was a path forward, and while the two companies did not disclose the price of the acquisition, it\u2019s worth noting that WarpStream announced a $20 million funding round led by Greylock and Amplify Partners earlier this year. \u201cIt was a good deal for all involved,\u201d Kreps said.",

        "title": "Climate change was a lot less prominent in this year\u2019s iPhone event",
        "text": "Last year, Apple couldn\u2019t say enough about the reduced climate impact of its products, going so far as hiring Octavia Spencer to play Mother Nature in a highly produced, five-minute promo spot. This year? Apple spent just a few minutes, total, on the subject.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the company is backsliding on its prior commitments \u2014 there was nothing in the keynote to suggest that \u2014 but it does show just how hard meaningful progress on carbon emissions can be, even for one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies.\n\nThe Apple Watch once again led climate news at this year\u2019s event. Previously, only the aluminum and Ultra models were claimed as carbon neutral; this year, the higher end versions, now made with a recycled titanium case instead of stainless steel, qualify.\n\n\u201cAny Apple Watch in any finish can be carbon neutral,\u201d Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s COO, said in the pre-recorded video. Note the use of the qualifier \u201ccan be\u201d: To be carbon neutral, users have to select a qualifying band, which is denoted on the website by a little green flower and some accompanying text. The cheapest bands, the fluoroelastomer sport bands, don\u2019t make the cut.\n\nEven the term \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d comes with a slew of caveats. Where Apple can\u2019t eliminate the use of fossil fuels, most prominently in its materials supply chain, the company buys carbon credits to make up the difference. Problem is, the market for carbon credits has been plagued by lax enforcement and scandal. Apple may very well do extra diligence to vet the credits it buys, but the system could use some work.\n\nPerhaps the most glaring omission was anything significant regarding climate progress for the iPhone. Sure, the enclosure now has 85% recycled content in the base model, the iPhone Pro has a 100% recycled aluminum chassis, and all iPhones come in 100% fiber-based, plastic-free packaging, but that\u2019s about it for news.\n\nIf you dig deeper into the environmental product report, Apple claims to have made some progress on the iPhone 16 Plus\u2019s climate impact, dropping 1 kg of carbon emissions from its life cycle compared with the previous generation. The vanilla iPhone 16 is unchanged relative to the 15.\n\nIn some ways, the dichotomy between the Apple Watch and the iPhone lines isn\u2019t surprising. Pick up any iPhone from the last few years, and it\u2019s pretty obvious that Apple isn\u2019t in the mood to overturn the cart when it comes to its flagship product line. In fact, there\u2019s a case to be made that Apple is taking a sensible approach by prioritizing the Watch over the iPhone.\n\nCompared with the iPhone, the Apple Watch remains a niche product that uses far fewer materials. It\u2019s far easier to coerce those suppliers to use renewable or low-carbon electricity. Eventually, lessons learned in building the Watch in that fashion could bubble up to the iPhone and the Mac. Apple doesn\u2019t appear to have committed to that path yet, but if the company is serious, it\u2019s a trend worth watching.",

        "title": "Why Apple added yet another button to the iPhone 16",
        "text": "Apple giveth and Apple taketh away \u2014 particularly when it comes to ports and buttons. The company has long taken a \u201cless is more\u201d approach to any detail that might disrupt its devices\u2019 feng shui. The company is feeling a lot more bullish about buttons these days. After introducing the Action Button on the Apple Watch Ultra, the company added the feature to the iPhone 15 last year. With another new iPhone comes another new iPhone button: Camera Control, which was announced at Apple\u2019s \u201cGlowtime\u201d event on Monday.\n\nThe feature harkens back to the bygone days of devoted camera buttons, which have almost entirely fallen out of favor on smartphones. For some, the quick, successive addition of two new buttons may feel like a step back.\n\nFor Apple, it\u2019s part of a feature ebb and flow that\u2019s not entirely uncommon in hardware. Ports and buttons come and go with every passing year.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine Apple adding Camera Control were Apple Intelligence not already on the docket. While camera features have always been an essential selling point for handset upgrades, in the long run, the driving force behind the button is something else altogether. As Software Engineering SVP and parkour enthusiast Craig Federighi noted, the forthcoming Visual Intelligence feature is \u201cenabled by Camera Control.\u201d\n\nHowever, much like other Apple Intelligence features, it won\u2019t launch alongside the iPhone 16 line later this month. With the feature MIA, the company is really leaning into its camera functionality in the meantime. Whether the button will ultimately be regarded as a camera- or Visual Intelligence-first feature ultimately comes down to the success of the latter and what Apple can do to distinguish it from the already ubiquitous Google Lens.\n\nApple offered time with the feature after the keynote, at least the camera aspect. Visual Intelligence won\u2019t launch until sometime later this year. As I got in closer to take a picture of the feature, I fumbled with my own phone, to which an Apple rep helpfully suggested my life would be improved with Camera Control. Fair enough.\n\nLike any other new feature, Camera Control takes a bit to master. The trickiest part is determining how much pressure to apply in order to toggle between features. That, however, is what makes it unique versus earlier camera buttons. It\u2019s more than just a way to open the camera app and take a shot. It also lets you navigate within the app itself.\n\nThis is particularly important in the wake of the iPhone 15\u2019s Action Button. Camera was, after all, one of the available options for the button. From a hardware perspective, the capacitive Camera Control button offers a much broader range of options than does the Action Button.\n\nCamera Control will be available across the iPhone 16 line when it launches later this month.",

Just after midnight on Saturday, Boeing\u2019s Starliner capsule returned from the International Space Station, touching down at White Sands Space Harbor, New Mexico.\n\nThe capsule returned autonomously to Earth without its two crew members, NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who will remain aboard the station until next February. The space agency determined late last month that the pair will make their journey back to Earth on board a SpaceX Dragon capsule, after Starliner experienced technical issues early in the mission.\n\nAt a post-flight press conference on Saturday, NASA\u2019s commercial crew program manager Steve Stich called the flight \u201cdarn near flawless.\u201d He added that the successful mission provoked mixed feelings among staff.\n\n\u201cFrom a human perspective, all of us feel happy about the successful landing, but then there\u2019s a piece of us, all of us, that we wish it would have been the way we had planned it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had planned to have the mission land with Butch and Suni on board.\u201d\n\nJust a little piece of non-public info in this story: By now, you\u2019ve probably heard that the first launch of Blue Origin\u2019s massive New Glenn rocket will not be for NASA. That rocket had been scheduled to launch two spacecraft to Mars for NASA during an eight-day window that opens on October 13. But NASA announced on Friday that it was pushing the mission, called ESCAPADE, to spring 2025, citing potential cost and technical issues with de-fueling the two satellites.\n\nWhat I\u2019m hearing is that there was an ATP (authority-to-proceed) meeting to go/no-go fueling the spacecraft the day before NASA formally postponed the mission. While this decision doubtless comes down to the readiness of the launch vehicle, fueling the spacecraft is a critical juncture. It makes sense that they chose to just delay rather than incur the risks \u2014 technical, financial, etc. \u2014 of having to de-fuel them.\n\nThis week in space history\n\nThis week, we\u2019re remembering the tragedy of the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York City. Did you know: There was only a single American off-world when the attacks happened? NASA astronaut Frank Culbertson was on board the International Space Station at the time, and as soon as he learned about the attacks, he immediately went to capture some images of the site from space.\n\n\u201cThe smoke seemed to have an odd bloom to it at the base of the column that was streaming south of the city. After reading one of the news articles we just received, I believe we were looking at NY around the time of, or shortly after, the collapse of the second tower. How horrible\u2026\u201d \u2013 Frank Culbertson",

        "text": "The newspaper business has been in the middle of a long and slow decline thanks to the rise of the internet. Now some new research out of the U.K. lays bare how TV news is facing a similar fate.\n\nOnline platforms have now overtaken TV for the first time as the most popular resource for news among adult consumers, at 71% versus 70%, according to new research from U.K. communications regulator Ofcom.\n\nThis is a significant shift. Not only has TV dominated news for more than 60 years (a period when it overtook newspapers in popularity for news; that was the first blow for broadsheets), but also as online platforms replace broadcasters (and newspapers), the news they carry comes from a much wider set of sources. That\u2019s both a blessing for having more viewpoints and a curse for being significantly harder to vet for accuracy \u2014 and consumers are concerned that this will only get worse with the growth of AI.\n\nOfcom\u2019s larger conclusions may not be a surprise: Newspapers have been in trouble for decades; TV has faced pressure from streaming and online media in other categories like entertainment for years; and AI has a lot to answer for in areas like deepfakes and misinformation. But the research is significant because it gives statistics to how usage is shifting, and Ofcom said it will use the conclusions to help determine what to focus its regulation on in the years ahead.\n\n\u201cTelevision has dominated people\u2019s news habits since the \u201960s, and it still commands really high trust,\u201d said Yih-Choung Teh, Ofcom\u2019s group director for strategy and research, in a statement. \u201cBut we\u2019re witnessing a generational shift to online news, which is often seen as less reliable \u2014 together with growing fears about misinformation and deepfake content. Ofcom wants to secure high-quality news for the next generation, so we\u2019re kicking off a review of the public service media that help underpin the U.K.\u2019s democracy and public debate.\u201d\n\nOfcom has been running annual surveys on news consumption since 2017. This year it canvassed over 5,000 adults both online and face-to-face.\n\nFace the news\n\nEven as online news as a broader category continues to have a disruptive force in the media market, getting online if you\u2019re a publisher is not exactly a panacea. Online news outlets are also seeing their audiences get eroded by newer kids on the block: Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and X/Twitter all make the list of top 10 news sources in the survey.\n\nImage Credits: Ofcom\n\nSome of this is a little ironic. There\u2019s been a rising controversy of fake news created and disseminated on platforms like Facebook, YouTube, X/Twitter and more over the last decade, and regulators and lawmakers have definitely taken notice. At the same time, and perhaps related to that heat, Facebook has moved to de-emphasize news on its platform, killing its own Facebook News effort earlier this year.\n\nYet news continues to be the powerful heartbeat of how people engage on these platforms. Some 30% of respondents said that they got their news from Facebook, putting it on par with the broadcaster ITV. Google-owned YouTube saw its share spike 12 percentage points to 19%.\n\nTikTok did not make it into the top 10 \u2014 yet? \u2014 but it\u2019s growing fast. Around 11% of adults said that it\u2019s a source for news, compared to just 1% in 2020.\n\nUsers between the ages of 12 and 15 have embraced news on TikTok in a big way. The ByteDance-owned short video platform was named by 30% of younger respondents as their go-to for news, with 12% describing it as their main source of news.\n\nSome 27% said they used YouTube for news, while Facebook and Instagram each registered with 21% of respondents. Snapchat and WhatsApp came in at 16%, with X/Twitter at 10%. (Interestingly, BBC continues to be a source, too: 36% said that they continue to use it for news, but it\u2019s the only one that stood out.)\n\nThe U.K. findings appear to largely mirror trends that are playing out in the U.S. Pew Research earlier this year found that about half of TikTok\u2019s users under the age of 30 are getting politics and news content from the video app.\n\nDon\u2019t trust the process\n\nThat trend should not be received without alarm bells. The rise of internet and user-generated content go hand in hand with a faster and looser idea of what constitutes news \u2014 and how that can be exploited.\n\nElection cycles continue to be the most acute examples of that. During the U.K. General Election earlier this year, Ofcom said that 60% of respondents in its survey recalled seeing false or misleading information, with 10% saying they saw this kind of content \u201cseveral times a day.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, 57% of respondents said they were worried about getting conned by deepfake content, with 27% saying they had already encountered some.\n\nTo be fair, as you can see from the table below, TV, newspapers and radio all still have a lot to do to gain more trust from consumers, too. The bigger effort should be to ensure that news does not simply become a race to the bottom.",

        "title": "Heart disease is the world\u2019s biggest killer \u2014 this Cambridge Uni spinout is using AI to find new treatments",
        "text": "While artificial intelligence (AI) promises to transform all manner of industries, the biggest game-changing breakthroughs in this new era of data-infused machine intelligence arguably lies in the field of drug discovery. By analyzing vast amounts of biological data, AI can help researchers predict how different chemical compounds will interact with specific targets in the body, accelerating the discovery of promising drug candidates.\n\nIt\u2019s against this backdrop that Cambridge University spinout CardiaTec is striving to tackle cardiovascular diseases (CVD). To bolster its efforts, the company today said it has raised $6.5 million in a seed round of funding.\n\nCVDs are the preeminent cause of death globally, resulting in 17.9 million deaths each year, according to The World Health Organization (WHO). At the top of the list is ischaemic heart disease (coronary heart disease), responsible for 13% of the world\u2019s total deaths.\n\nFounded in 2021, CardiaTec is the handiwork of biotech and bioengineering graduates Raphael Peralta (CEO) and Thelma Zablocki (COO). They\u2019re supported by their third co-founder and CTO, Namshik Han, a lecturer in AI drug discovery at the University of Cambridge, where Peralta and Zablocki studied for an MPhil in Bioscience Enterprise. Han, who has a background in machine learning, computational biology, cancer genomics, and cancer epigenomics, is also head of AI at the university\u2019s Milner Therapeutics Institute, which forges close ties with industry, including pharmaceutical companies.\n\n\u201cHe (Han) is an academic who sits on the border with industry, so he understands that translational perspective,\u201d Peralta told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cWe came together with the opportunity to use Namshik\u2019s work, but within the cardiovascular space.\u201d\n\nCardiaTec is tackling the crux of the problem: The average expense of progressing a drug candidate from discovery through launch is around $2.2 billion, and that cost is driven substantively by the fact that 90% of potential candidates fail in the process, according to Deloitte. CardiaTec is setting out to \u201cdecode\u201d the biology of CVDs.\n\nTo do this, the company has struck partnerships with 65 hospitals across the U.K. and the U.S., which are providing human heart tissue as part of the company\u2019s broader data collection efforts, which will help it build what it calls the \u201clargest human heart tissue-multi-omics dataset,\u201d spanning a broad gamut of biological information from across molecular biology. By doing this, CardiaTec hopes to identify novel, targeted therapeutics.\n\n\u201cHistorically, it\u2019s been very difficult to access human tissue, especially those of deceased people because of matters related to consent, ethics, and logistics,\u201d Peralta said. \u201cNow the infrastructure in hospitals is much more embedded, and we can actually begin to get access to these human tissues and generate data.\u201d\n\nIn the context of cardiovascular disease, this means that CardiaTec can compare healthy artery tissue with that of an artery where plaque buildup has led to a heart attack, and generate the data its computational models need further downstream. Such computational approaches, involving a vast amount of different \u201cmulti-omics\u201d data types, are capable of aggregating and analyzing data at a scale humans simply can\u2019t match.\n\n\u201cWe can now look not just in genetics, but we can look at genetics, epigenetics, gene expression, protein function, all in a single model,\u201d Peralta said. \u201cSo we have a much more in depth understanding of the mechanisms that are driving disease.\u201d\n\nCardiaTec co-founder and CEO Raphael Peralta Image Credits: CardiaTec (opens in a new window)\n\nHeart of the problem\n\nWhile drugs made with help from AI have yet to make it to market, the early promise has created a wave of excitement and a swathe of startups have raised bucketloads of cash in the process. In the past few months alone, we\u2019ve seen the likes of Xaira emerge from stealth with $1 billion in funding, while Sam Altman-backed Formation Bio raised $372 million. In the U.K., meanwhile, Healx has nabbed $47 million to identify new drugs for rare diseases.\n\nHeavily VC-backed pharmaceutical startup Insilico Medicine recently claimed a world\u2019s first when it announced that it had identified a new drug candidate for a rare lung disease called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. AI played a pivotal role not only in designing the drug\u2019s chemical structure, but in figuring out which part of a cell it should be targeting. The drug was initially tested in animals, and is currently in \u201cPhase II\u201d trials in the U.S. and China, where it\u2019s hoped it will generate the evidence needed to establish its efficacy in treating humans.\n\nElsewhere, AI is being used to help discover everything from new antibiotics for tackling superbugs, to drugs for treating obsessive compulsive order (OCD).\n\nCiting data from peer-reviewed journal Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, Peralta said one of CardiaTec\u2019s main differentiators is that its focus lies squarely on cardiovascular disease, which only 3% of active AI-first companies are targeting.\n\n\u201cThe majority of companies who are applying AI in therapeutic discovery are in oncology, followed by central nervous systems and neurogenic diseases, respiratory and infectious diseases, and then way at the bottom of the list is cardiovascular diseases,\u201d Peralta said. \u201cCardiovascular disease is the world\u2019s leading global cause of death \u2014 not a lot of people know that, but there\u2019s a big unmet need that hasn\u2019t been captured in pharma.\u201d\n\nCardiaTec had previously raised $1.8 million in pre-seed funding, and with this fresh $6.5 million in cash, the company is well-financed to extend its proprietary data gathering efforts, wet lab validation of its therapeutic targets model, and bolster its eight-person team in Cambridge. The next step is to start identifying and testing actual drug candidates, which \u2014 in the grand scheme of drug R&D \u2014 is likely to be several years away.\n\nCardiaTec\u2019s seed round was led by Montage Ventures, with participation from Continuum Health Ventures, Laidlaw Ventures, Apex Ventures, and a number of angel investors.",

        "title": "What is Apple Intelligence, when is it coming and who will get it?",
        "text": "After months of speculation, Apple Intelligence took center stage at WWDC 2024 in June. The platform was announced in the wake of a torrent of generative AI news from companies like Google and Open AI, causing concern that the famously tight-lipped tech giant had missed the boat on the latest tech craze.\n\nContrary to such speculation, however, Apple had a team in place, working on what proved to be a very Apple approach to artificial intelligence. There was still pizzazz amid the demos \u2014 Apple always loves to put on a show \u2014 but Apple Intelligence is ultimately a very pragmatic take on the category.\n\nApple Intelligence (yes, AI for short) isn\u2019t a standalone feature. Rather, it\u2019s about integrating into existing offerings. While it is a branding exercise in a very real sense, the large language model (LLM) driven technology will operate behind the scenes. As far as the consumer is concerned, the technology will mostly present itself in the form of new features for existing apps.\n\nWe learned more during the Apple\u2019s iPhone 16 event, which was held on September 9. During the event, Apple touted a number of AI-powered features coming to their devices, from translation on the Apple Watch Series 10, visual search on iPhones and a number of tweaks to Siri\u2019s capabilities. Apple also revealed that Intelligence would launch in beta this fall in the U.S. in English, with a wider international rollout with additional languages planned through the end of this year into 2025.\n\nWhat is Apple Intelligence?\n\nImage Credits: Apple\n\nCupertino marketing executives have branded Apple Intelligence: \u201cAI for the rest of us.\u201d The platform is designed to leverage the things that generative AI already does well, like text and image generation, to improve upon existing features. Like other platforms including ChatGPT and Google Gemini, Apple Intelligence was trained on large information models. These systems use deep learning to form connections, whether it be text, images, video or music.\n\nThe text offering, powered by LLM, presents itself as Writing Tools. The feature is available across various Apple apps, including Mail, Messages, Pages and Notifications. It can be used to provide summaries of long text, proofread and even write messages for you, using content and tone prompts.\n\nImage generation has been integrated as well, in similar fashion \u2014 albeit a bit less seamlessly. Users can prompt Apple Intelligence to generate custom emojis (Genmojis) in an Apple house style. Image Playground, meanwhile, is a standalone image generation app that utilizes prompts to create visual content than can be used in Messages, Keynote or shared via social media.\n\nApple Intelligence also marks a long-awaited face-lift for Siri. The smart assistant was early to the game, but has mostly been neglected for the past several years. Siri is integrated much more deeply into Apple\u2019s operating systems; for instance, instead of the familiar icon, users will see a glowing light around the edge of their iPhone screen when it\u2019s doing its thing.\n\nMore important, new Siri works across apps. That means, for example, that you can ask Siri to edit a photo and then insert it directly into a text message. It\u2019s a frictionless experience the assistant had previously lacked. Onscreen awareness means Siri uses the context of the content you\u2019re currently engaged with to provide an appropriate answer.\n\nWho gets Apple Intelligence and when?\n\nImage Credits: Darrell Etherington\n\nIt\u2019s too early to speak to the efficacy of any of the above features. While the latest batch of Apple operating systems hit public beta in July, Apple Intelligence isn\u2019t yet fully baked. It\u2019s clear, however, that Apple was pressed to talk it up in June both to bely concern that it didn\u2019t have a generative AI plan and to offer a head start for developers.\n\nWhile we saw demos at WWDC, we\u2019re going to have to wait until the fall to get our hands on a beta of Apple Intelligence. The first release will come in October in the U.S., solely with support for English. In December, localized English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the U.K. will launch, and sometime in 2025 Apple planns to roll out Chinese, French, Japanese and Spanish language compatibility. As it happens, fall is also when the public versions of iOS/iPadOS 18 and Mac Sequoia will hit the App Store. The offering will be free to use, so long as you have one of the following pieces of hardware:\n\niPhone 15 Pro Max (A17 Pro)\n\niPhone 15 Pro (A17 Pro)\n\niPad Pro (M1 and later)\n\niPad Air (M1 and later)\n\nMacBook Air (M1 and later)\n\nMacBook Pro (M1 and later)\n\niMac (M1 and later)\n\nMac mini (M1 and later)\n\nMac Studio (M1 Max and later)\n\nMac Pro (M2 Ultra)\n\nNotably, only the Pro versions of the iPhone 15 are getting access, owing to shortcomings on the standard model\u2019s chipset. Presumably, however, the whole iPhone 16 line will be able to run Apple Intelligence when it arrives.\n\nPrivate Cloud Compute\n\nImage Credits: Apple\n\nApple has taken a small-model, bespoke approach to training. Rather than relying on the kind of kitchen sink approach that fuels platforms like GPT and Gemini, the company has compiled datasets in-house for specific tasks like, say, composing an email. The biggest benefit of this approach is that many of these tasks become far less resource intensive and can be performed on-device.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t apply to everything, however. More complex queries will utilize the new Private Cloud Compute offering. The company now operates remote servers running on Apple Silicon, which it claims allows it to offer the same level of privacy as its consumer devices. Whether an action is being performed locally or via the cloud will be invisible to the user, unless their device is offline, at which point remote queries will toss up an error.\n\nApple Intelligence with third-party apps\n\nImage Credits: Didem Mente/Anadolu Agency / Getty Images\n\nA lot was made about Apple\u2019s pending partnership with OpenAI ahead of WWDC. Ultimately, however, it turned out that the deal was less about powering Apple Intelligence and more about offering an alternative platform for those things it\u2019s not really built for. It\u2019s a tacit acknowledgement that building a small-model system has its limitation.\n\nApple Intelligence is free. So, too, is access to ChatGPT. However, those with paid accounts to the latter will have access to premium features free users don\u2019t. This will, presumably, be a big driver to the already thriving generative AI platform.\n\nWe know for sure that Apple plans to partner with additional generative AI services. The company all but said that Google Gemini is next on that list.",

        "title": "Miami-based AI bookkeeping startup Finally has raised another big round: $200M in equity and debt",
        "text": "The SMB-focused bookkeeping, accounting and finance startup Finally has raised $50 million in a Series B round of funding and secured a $150 million credit line, TechCrunch is the first to report.\n\nThe financing comes just seven months after the fintech company announced it had raised $10 million in funding, and brings Miami-based Finally\u2019s total raised since its 2018 inception to $305 million in debt ($235 million in credit facilities) and equity ($74 million).\n\nFelix Rodriguez came up with the idea for Finally after seeing his Dominican Republican-born family start their own businesses in the United States. He\u2019d also experienced his own challenges firsthand when starting his own companies, and concluded that not all small businesses were on a level playing field when it came to bookkeeping and working capital.\n\nSo in 2018, after also having worked as a network engineer, Rodriguez and his wife, Glennys Rodriguez, began helping small and mid-sized businesses manage their finances. The couple then teamed up with Edwin Mejia to start Finally. The company\u2019s offering has evolved over time and today, finally offers AI-powered bookkeeping as well as accounting and financial services. It also offers a corporate card with insights into spending and last year, it added an artificial intelligence-powered ledger that offered business banking functions.\n\nIn some respects, Finally competes with the likes of Brex and Ramp as it offers expense management and a corporate card. But the company maintains it\u2019s \u201ca multi-product platform\u201d that, for example, also offers payroll processing.\n\n\u201cFinally is especially useful for SMB owners that don\u2019t have time to learn 20 different apps for their bookkeeping and finance functions,\u201d Felix Rodriguez said. \u201cSMB owners have many priorities and often limited time. But one of the most important parts of running a business is understanding financial metrics, including cash burn and cash flow.\u201d\n\nSince announcing its $95 million Series A in March of 2022, Finally says it has seen annual revenue growth of 300%, although it declined to reveal hard figures. The company serves over 1,500 business in the United States, and makes money through a combination of SaaS subscription fees, interchange fees and interest income.\n\nFinally also declined to share its valuation, saying only the Series B was \u201can up round.\u201d\n\nPeakSpan provided the equity portion of the raise while Encina is offering the $150 million credit facility. The company plans to deepen its investment in sales and marketing and add new features such as a module for global hiring in its hiring product and more support for payments on the finance side.\n\nIt also plans to keep hiring. Presently, Finally has more than 220 employees, up from 95 this time last year. Among its hires this year was the appointment of Roy Duvall, former CTO at Calendly, to serve as its chief technology officer.\n\nJack Freeman, partner at PeakSpan Capital, said his firm had been evaluating the bookkeeping automation space for \u201cseveral years\u201d prior to meeting Rodriguez. The firm also provided capital in Finally\u2019s $10 million raise earlier this year.\n\n\u201cWe immediately fell in love with his \u2018all-in-one\u2019 vision,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cWhile other spend management software providers are focused on building out software features, Finally understands intuitively that software is only as valuable as the data you can feed it.\u201d\n\nFinally, he said, ingests data, integrates with other software and offers embedded credit products alongside software products in an effort to serve as a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for an SMB.\n\nFinally is not the only startup in this space to raise a significant amount as of late. In June, AccountsIQ, a Dublin-founded accounting technology company, raised \u20ac60 million (about $65 million) to build \u201cthe finance function of the future\u201d for midsized companies: cloud-based, automated services boosted by AI to help accounting departments work faster and more intelligently. And Pennylane, another accounting startup that focuses on the SMB market, raised $40 million at a valuation of over $1 billion in February.\n\nWant more fintech news in your inbox?

        "title": "iPhone 16, Apple Intelligence, AirPods 4 and more: Everything revealed at Apple Event 2024",
        "text": "Apple\u2019s biggest event of the year has arrived, and with it, the iPhone 16 lineup and a slew of AI-related updates for iOS 18. Apple Intelligence was the star of the Apple event this year, like it was at WWDC in June, and Apple\u2019s lineup of announcements echoed many of the anticipated hardware reveals, including the new iPhone 16, AirPods 4, the Apple Watch Series 10 and more. Broadcasting live from its headquarters in Cupertino, Apple\u2019s \u201cGlowtime\u201d event kicked off at 10 a.m. PT, and you can watch the recording of the full Apple event here.\n\nWhether Monday\u2019s reveals end up inspiring or delaying a \u201csupercycle\u201d of customers adopting the new iPhone 16 lineup remains to be seen, but Apple\u2019s focus on AI as a core part of its sales pitch moving forward is clear. We\u2019ll keep this post updated as reports emerge from the demo rooms and briefings following the event.\n\niPhone 16\n\nImage Credits: Apple\n\nAs no surprise, the iPhone 16 \u201chas been designed for Apple Intelligence from the ground up,\u201d in the words of CEO Tim Cook, and the tweaked designs and new colors were revealed at the Apple event. The new iPhone 16 lineup comes with a camera control along the side, which allows for physical interactions to access camera features, along with the new A18 chip that Apple claims makes the iPhone 16 up to 30% faster than the iPhone 15. The iPhone 16 starts at $799 for the 128GB model, with the 16 Plus starting at $899 with the same amount of storage. Catch up on our ongoing iPhone 16 updates here.\n\nAnd for a rundown on what distinguishes the new iPhone 16 lineup, you can head right here.\n\nHands-on with the iPhone 16\u2019s camera button\n\nImage Credits: Brian Heater\n\nIn the words of our editor Brian Heater, Apple is \u201cfeeling a lot more bullish about buttons these days.\u201d And after the Apple event broadcast concluded, he got the chance to see that the Camera Control button actually adds to the iPhone experience, at least for a brief demo.\n\n\u201cLike any other new feature, Camera Control takes a bit to master. The trickiest part is determining how much pressure to apply in order to toggle between features. That, however, is what makes it unique versus earlier camera buttons. It\u2019s more than just a way to open the camera app and take a shot. It also lets you navigate within the app itself,\u201d he wrote, and you can check out his full hands-on with the iPhone 16\u2019s biggest physical change right here.\n\nApple Intelligence\n\nImage Credits: Apple\n\nFirst revealed at WWDC, Apple Intelligence is mostly being presented as a more private large language model operating behind the scenes to improve existing apps and features. Retreading many of its WWDC reveals, Apple touted Intelligence\u2019s ability to survey inboxes, with summaries surfacing for emails, and notifications altered to provide summaries as well with priority notifications elevated to the top of their stacks. Claiming \u201ca new era for Siri,\u201d Apple boasted that its Intelligence upgrades allow Siri to understand requests that are less than eloquently delivered, walk users through specific tasks within the iPhone and gain on-screen awareness of actions taking place on the phone.\n\nApple Intelligence is launching as a beta in the U.S. in the fall, with localized English coming to several markets in December. Additional languages like Chinese, French, Japanese and Spanish are targeted for 2025.\n\nApple also detailed visual search, which is powered by Apple Intelligence, which combines the functions of a reverse image search with text recognition to add the details of an event to your calendar from a photo, or pull information about a restaurant directly from a photo of it.\n\nUltimately, one of the biggest questions coming out of Apple\u2019s claims about Intelligence\u2019s potential to improve user experiences across multiple product lines is simple: Is Siri actually useful now?\n\niOS 18 launching September 16\n\nImage Credits: Apple\n\nWe already got a first impression of iOS 18 through its beta release earlier this year, though its initial rollout without Apple Intelligence\u2019s features wasn\u2019t particularly impressive. As mentioned above, a lot of the most anticipated AI features will be coming later in 2024, but iOS 18 still has other messaging and control center updates you can run through in detail here ahead of its newly announced launch date of September 16, with all iPhones, including and after the iPhone XR and SE (second gen), eligible for the update. You can get a more detailed rundown on your device\u2019s iOS 18 compatibility here.\n\nCamera controls on the iPhone 16\n\nImage Credits: Apple\n\nOne of the biggest physical updates to the iPhone 16 lineup comes in the form of the camera control button. The camera control responds to clicks and different physical gestures, with light presses showing clean previews while a hard click can take a photo. Trailing a finger along the button lets dials and settings to be changed. Read the full rundown on what the camera control can be used for here.\n\niPhone 16 Pro, Pro Max\n\nImage Credits: Apple\n\nApple\u2019s more premium iPhone models come with expected screen changes, with the screen taking up 6.3 inches on the Pro, 6.9 inches on the Pro Max for the biggest screens on an iPhone yet. The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max have a new A18 Pro chip, an upgraded camera with faster shutter speeds, the ability to capture 4K video at 120 fps and other changes you can run through here. The iPhone 16 Pro stars at $999 and the 16 Pro Max starts at $1,119 with both up for preorder Friday and launching in stores September 20.\n\nApple Watch Series 10\n\nImage Credits: Apple\n\nApple kicked things off with reveals on the Watch for the line\u2019s 10th anniversary, rolling out a series of updates within the Apple Watch Series 10 line, including a tweaked design with more rounded corners and an updated aspect ratio, with Apple\u2019s first wide-angle OLED screens. The Series 10\u2019s display is up to 40% brighter when viewed at an angle and is the thinnest Apple Watch yet at 9.7mm and up to 10% lighter than the previous models. Unsurprisingly, AI featured in the Apple Watch Series 10 reveal, with a new photos watch face using AI to curate the photos shown on the display, and translation tools using machine learning to improve output.\n\nApple Watches are also getting an update to detect sleep apnea, which is pending FDA clearance. The feature will come to both the Series 10 and Series 9 watches. The Apple Watch Series 10 will start at $399, and it launches September 20.\n\nRead more on the Apple Watch Series 10 here.\n\nApple Watch Ultra\n\nImage Credits: Apple\n\nApple has long touted the Ultra as a device for fitness aficionados, boasting custom workouts, running track detection, bike rides as live activities and so on. And after a lead-up to a reveal, Apple dropped that there won\u2019t be an Apple Watch Ultra 3 yet, instead announcing a new satin black color for the Ultra 2.\n\nAirPods 4\n\nImage Credits: Apple\n\nApple claims the new AirPods 4 are the \u201cmost comfortable AirPods ever,\u201d with a new A2 chip under the tweaked design. Personalized Spatial Audio is coming to the AirPods 4, along with the addition of machine learning for Siri to pick up head shakes and nods as responses to prompts. The new AirPods 4 will also be available September 20, starting at $129 with active noise cancellation added for the $179 tier. Get the full rundown on the AirPods updates here.\n\nAirPods Pro 2\n\nImage Credits: Apple\n\nThree points were highlighted for AirPods Pro 2 updates: prevention, awareness and assistance. For prevention, hearing protection will be added and on by default for passive noise reduction, managed through machine learning. For awareness, Apple is adding a \u201cclinically validated\u201d hearing test that owners can take at any time.\n\nAnd then for assistance, hearing aid features are launching for those whose hearing tests identify them as potentially benefiting from hearing assistance features. Apple claims that they expect clearance from the FDA on these features \u201csoon,\u201d with updates expected to come to iOS in the fall.\n\nAirPods Max\n\nImage Credits: Apple\n\nA series of incremental updates came to AirPods Max during the Apple Event, with USB-C added in, and a series of new colors coming to the updated headphones September 20 for the same price of $549. Get the full rundown here.\n\nCheaper iPhones (in India)\n\nApple readies first retail store in India Image Credits: Apple\n\nThe iPhone 16 lineup pricing is familiar for those following Apple in the states, but in India, Apple fans will be able to benefit from a discount from the iPhone 15 lineup of about 15,000 rupees, which is roughly $178, The price comes after India lowered import duties on electronics, and amid Apple\u2019s expansion of local manufacturing, which had earlier spurred a discount for the 15 models in the country.\n\nVoice Memos with background music\n\nImage Credits: Apple\n\nApple showed off a new feature for the Voice Memos app, which allows vocal tracks to be layered on top of pre-recorded music or instrumentals. Read more here.\n\nNew macOS Sequoia launching September 16\n\nImage Credits: Apple\n\nIn an untraditionally swift launch for its macOS updates, Apple announced that the update first showcased at WWDC 2024 will launch in a week, with a series of updates built upon Apple Intelligence that you can run through here.",

The test, which has users tap on their smartphone\u2019s screen after they hear a series of tones at different volumes and frequencies, builds on learnings from Apple\u2019s hearing studies, and was developed using \u201clarge-scale real-world data,\u201d Apple says.\n\nAfter taking a hearing test, you\u2019ll get results in a personalized hearing profile (which the aforementioned hearing aid feature uses).

It also applies a personalized hearing profile (more on that below) to music, movies and phone calls across devices.\n\nApple says this will allow wearers to better hear their surroundings and engage in conversations.\n\nImage Credits: Apple\n\nIn a related announcement, Apple previewed a five-minute certified hearing test coming to iOS 18 and AirPods Pro 2 that\u2019ll allow users to check their current hearing health. The test, which has users tap on their smartphone\u2019s screen after they hear a series of tones at different volumes and frequencies, builds on learnings from Apple\u2019s hearing studies, and was developed using \u201clarge-scale real-world data,\u201d Apple says.\n\nAfter taking a hearing test, you\u2019ll get results in a personalized hearing profile (which the aforementioned hearing aid feature uses). The results will be stored in Apple\u2019s Health app, where they can optionally be shared with a healthcare provider.\n\nThe hearing profile can be applied in tandem with a feature called Media Assist to boost certain parts of speech on a phone call or instruments within a soundtrack. Apple claims that users with little-to-no hearing loss can still benefit from the adjustments at individual frequencies.\n\nBoth the hearing aid feature for AirPods Pro 2 and the hearing test for iOS 18 will launch this fall via a software update in over 100 countries and regions.",
