        "title": "From their experiences at Uber and PayPal, Palm founders want to make moving cash easier for big companies",
        "text": "At Uber, Gurjit Pannu remembers moving billions in cash across bank accounts globally, realizing almost immediately the importance of effective cash flow management.\n\nChristian Sobkowski, meanwhile, recalls his days working in financial services, most notably at PayPal, where helped expand the company\u2019s business across Europe.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder then, that the two decided to come together as co-CEOs, pairing their financial backgrounds to create a company that, in hindsight, would have made Pannu\u2019s former day job much easier.\n\n\u201cWith Treasury teams deciding how the largest corporations move cash around the world, it became obvious that guiding those money flows was worthy of bringing the best talent to re-think how it\u2019s done,\u201d Sobkowski told TechCrunch.\n\nThe result is Palm, launched in 2023 with the goal of making cash management for enterprise treasury teams easier. Today, it\u2019s announcing a $6.1 million seed round led by Speeinvest and Target Global. The company has built all-in-one platform to let businesses move money between hundreds of bank accounts and subsidiaries in a more efficient way.\n\nPalm\u2019s platform lets businesses move money between hundreds of bank accounts and subsidiaries in a more efficient way. It tracks daily money movement, and the setup process takes weeks rather than months like traditional treasurer systems, the founders claim. It also has an automated feature that provides tailored cash forecasting in a way that the company says outperforms human models at least 75% of the time.\n\n\u201cAlthough we had a treasury management system, all of the forecasting and money movements were managed in spreadsheets because the systems we used weren\u2019t reliable enough to build the process around,\u201d Pannu recalled of his time at Uber. \u201cThey required tons of workarounds and costly customization to meet our requirements. With an ever-evolving business, we couldn\u2019t invest the time [or] money to customizing a process within the tool that would later become redundant.\u201d\n\nFor many companies, Pannu says the executive of payments is quite straightforward \u2014 but the friction and decision-making leading up to making such decisions is \u201carduous.\u201d\n\n\u201cTreasury teams must retrieve balances across hundreds of accounts, understand the funding need on these accounts, determine when the payment is required to ensure it gets there on time and determine the correct commercial instrument is being designated for the movement,\u201d Pannu mapped out. \u201cTeams must also have the funds follow an intricate map across entity structures to ensure compliance.\u201d\n\nIn other words \u2014 it\u2019s a lot of work that perhaps could use some automation.\n\nPalm has clients listed on the NASDAQ and NYSE but declined to share their names. Palm plans to use the fundraise to expand its team, especially within product and engineering. The company\u2019s closed beta is also now accepting new customers. The company\u2019s beta ends at the end of this year.",

        "title": "Bluesky continues to soar, adding 2M more new users in a matter of days",
        "text": "Social networking startup Bluesky continues to benefit from X\u2019s shutdown in Brazil, having now added more than 2 million new users over the past four days, up from just half a million as of Friday. This rapid growth led some users to encounter the occasional error that would state there were \u201cNot Enough Resources\u201d to handle requests, as Bluesky engineers scrambled to keep the servers stable under the influx of new sign-ups.\n\nAs new users downloaded the app, Bluesky jumped to becoming the No. 1 app in Brazil over the weekend, ahead of Meta\u2019s X competitor, Instagram Threads. According to app intelligence firm Appfigures, Bluesky\u2019s total downloads soared by 10,584% this weekend compared to last, and its downloads in Brazil were up by a whopping 1,018,952%. The growth seems to be having a halo effect, as downloads outside Brazil also rose by 584%, the firm noted. In part, this is due to Bluesky receiving downloads in 22 countries where it had barely seen any traction before.\n\nIn terms of absolute downloads, countries that saw the most installs outside Brazil included the U.S., Portugal, the U.K., Canada and Spain. Those with the most download growth, however, were Portugal, Chile, Argentina, Colombia and Romania. Most of the latter group jumped from single-digit growth to growth in the thousands.\n\nBluesky\u2019s newcomers have actively engaged on the platform, too, driving up other key metrics.\n\nAs one Bluesky engineer remarked, the number of likes on the social network grew to 104.6 million over the past four-day period, up from just 13 million when compared with a similar period just a week ago. Follows also grew from 1.4 million to 100.8 million while reposts grew from 1.3 million to 11 million.\n\nAs of Monday, Bluesky said it had added 2.11 million users during the past four days, up from 26,000 users it had added in the week-ago period. In addition, the company noted it had seen \u201csignificantly more than a 100% [daily active users] increase.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Bluesky told TechCrunch the number is now 2.4 million and continues to grow \u201cby the minute.\u201d\n\nBluesky\u2019s appeal to those forced to leave X may have to do with how closely the user experience resembles that of the now Elon Musk-owned app, formerly known as Twitter. Once incubated within Twitter, Bluesky spun out as a separate company and raised its own funding, but still retains much of Twitter\u2019s look and feel.\n\nLike X, Bluesky offers features like likes, reposts, quote posts, lists, direct messages, search tools and user profiles, but it also improves on X\u2019s capabilities in other ways. As a decentralized social network, users can set up their own instances (servers that run Bluesky and connect to others over the AT Protocol), customize their feeds, subscribe to third-party moderation services and create and share \u201cstarter packs\u201d that link to curated sets of recommended users to follow. In a coming update, Bluesky also plans to add support for video, the company says.\n\nAnother factor to consider here is how Bluesky\u2019s approach to content and moderation differs from Threads.\n\nEven when it was Twitter, X has long been known as a hotbed for breaking news and political debates. Threads has taken the opposite approach, saying it would not default to recommending political content on its platform. Instead, Threads wants to make itself palatable to brands and influencers, similar to Instagram, as it intends to eventually monetize via ads.\n\nGiven that X\u2019s ban in Brazil is tied to politics \u2014 the country wanted control over what could be said on the platform \u2014 it\u2019s likely that some Brazilians opting for Bluesky wanted to join a network that was not centralized and as easily controlled. On platforms like X, moderation decisions are left up to the site\u2019s owners, but on decentralized networks, the users are in charge.\n\nThat flexibility, combined with Bluesky\u2019s ease of use, could make the network a bigger draw than others.\n\nFor instance, though Mastodon offers its own decentralized network, the recent user growth driven by Brazil was on a much smaller scale. On Saturday, Mastodon founder and CEO Eugen Rochko said the service had seen 4,200 signups from Brazil, up from 152 signups on August 28, for instance. That could speak to the fact that Brazilians want more than decentralization: They also want a place that more closely resembles Twitter/X.\n\nMeta has not yet commented on how large an increase it\u2019s seen on Threads driven by Brazilians leaving X, but as a network that already has over 200 million monthly active users, even the addition of thousands or millions would not be as noticeable a gain, compared with the much smaller Bluesky. Still, it\u2019s also possible that Brazilians wanted to move to a place that was separate from friends, family and creators \u2014 one that defaulted to public postings and felt more like Twitter once did. Bluesky\u2019s culture, which tends toward s***posting and memes, has the sort of chaotic energy of an early Twitter.\n\nX is said to have had north of 20 million users in Brazil, which means there\u2019s plenty of growth to be captured all around.\n\nUpdated 9/3/24, 3:15 p.m. ET with the most recent numbers from Bluesky (2.4 million).",

        "title": "Snap CEO says the company is testing a \u2018simplified\u2019 Snapchat",
        "text": "Snap is testing a \u201csimplified version of Snapchat,\u201d CEO Evan Spiegel wrote in a letter to employees published on Snap\u2019s website Tuesday. The CEO says the simplified version aims to improve the platform\u2019s accessibility and usability. For those that remember Snapchat\u2019s 2018 redesign, this news may do little to stoke confidence.\n\nSpiegel attempted to rally employee spirits with his letter on Tuesday after a depressing year for the company\u2019s stock price, which has fallen nearly 50% in 2024.\n\n\u201cInvestors are concerned that we aren\u2019t growing faster,\u201d said Spiegel in the letter.\n\nThe \u201csimplified\u201d Snapchat may be an attempt to capture older users, who are historically perplexed by the app\u2019s not-so-intuitive design. Snapchat does a lot better at attracting younger audiences, who seem to just get the app. But this isn\u2019t the first time Snapchat has tried to reconcile these issues.\n\nYou might remember Snap\u2019s 2017 earnings call when Spiegel admitted that he\u2019s heard, \u201cSnapchat is difficult to understand or hard to use,\u201d particularly for older folks. Months later, Snap pushed out a major redesign to reclaim those users, jamming Stories between private messages, among other changes that ended up infuriating more users than it attracted.\n\nA 2018 Change.org petition to \u201cremove the new Snapchat update\u201d received 1.2 million signatories, while celebrity influencers like Kylie Jenner, Chrissy Teigen and Marques Brownlee expressed their frustration. But even worse, the redesign cratered the platform\u2019s ad views and revenue, alienating its younger userbase while failing in its bid to attract older folks. By May of 2018, Snap was scrambling to roll back some of the changes.\n\nSpiegel writes in Tuesday\u2019s letter that early tests of the simplified redesign have been \u201cdirectionally positive,\u201d though the CEO notes \u201cwe will be thoughtful and deliberate about making a change of this magnitude.\u201d He\u2019s almost definitely alluding to the 2018 redesign failure, which I\u2019m sure no one at Snap has forgotten about.\n\nThe announcement of a new, simplified version of Snapchat was tucked into Spiegel\u2019s broader musings about Snap\u2019s business strategy. He claimed that Snap\u2019s venture into augmented reality glasses \u2014 which it calls Spectacles \u2014 would yield a market with no competitors. Perhaps he\u2019s pretending that Meta\u2019s AR glasses, Meta Ray-Bans, simply don\u2019t exist?\n\nIn an effort to stimulate Snapchat\u2019s struggling ad division, Spiegel also announced new placements for ads, called Sponsored Snaps and Promoted Places. The former allows advertisers to send Snapchats directly to users\u2019 chat inboxes, and the latter lets advertisers promote destinations on Snap Map.",

        "title": "Canva has increased prices for its Teams product",
        "text": "Canva, the design platform, is increasing prices steeply for some customers. And it\u2019s blaming the move in part on generative AI.\n\nIn the U.S., some Canva Teams subscribers on older pricing plans are seeing the sticker price for a five-person plan jump from $119.99 per year to $500 per year (with a 40% discount for the first 12 months). In Australia, meanwhile, the flat $39.99 AUS (about $26) per-month fee for up to five users has been raised to $13.50 AUS for each user.\n\nOn an individual user basis, Canva Teams prices are now $100 per person, or $10 a month per person, with a minimum of three people required for a Teams plan. Those prices were quietly changed earlier this year for new customers, but now the company is changing the price for customers who\u2019d previously paid a lower price.\n\nThe price changes don\u2019t apply to Canva\u2019s Pro or Enterprise tiers.\n\nIn a statement to TechCrunch, a Canva spokesperson confirmed the new price points and pointed to the company\u2019s growing suite of generative AI tools \u2014 including Magic Studio \u2014 as a reason for the adjustments. They also noted that some of Canva\u2019s customers had been locked into lower prices that Canva no longer offers; Canva quietly changed its Teams pricing earlier this year to $10 per month for each user.\n\n\u201cOur original pricing reflected the early stage of this product and has remained unchanged for the last four years,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe\u2019re now updating the price for customers on this older plan to reflect our expanded product experience.\u201d\n\nCanva price increase is one of the biggest increases I have ever seen YoY. pic.twitter.com/8MOEYMcRm3 \u2014 Will Sanders (@wlsndrs) August 30, 2024\n\nCanva\u2019s price hikes, which come as the company readies for an IPO, haven\u2019t been well received, unsurprisingly. Users took particular issue with the fact that Canva communicated the changes through customer emails instead of publicly, as it has in the past.\n\nThe new pricing is a departure from Canva\u2019s roots as an affordable alternative to design software like Adobe\u2019s. It may also be a reflection of the startup growing too quickly, too fast; in March, Canva acquired U.K.-based graphic design software firm Serif for ~$380 million and just in August bought generative AI image company Leonardo.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misstated the Canva Teams price for Australian customers. It is $13.50 per user per month, with a three-user minimum.",

        "title": "Apple Event 2024: iPhone 16, Apple Intelligence and all the other expected \u2018Glowtime\u2019 reveals",
        "text": "Sometimes a headline is enough. Apple will reveal the iPhone 16 at its September 9 \u201cIt\u2019s Glowtime\u201d event; this much we can tell you for certain. But Apple doesn\u2019t invite us to fly across the country for a single product \u2014 not to mention booking a hotel room on the 49ers opening day. Football aside, the timing of the annual event is important, as it\u2019s one last major opportunity to announce a bunch of hardware ahead of the holidays.\n\nThe livestream kicks off on Monday at 10 a.m. PT. The invites dropped last week with the \u201cGlowtime\u201d tag line and a color scheme to match. Apple loves to sprinkle small hints into these graphics, and this one appears more on the nose than most.\n\nApple Intelligence and Siri\n\nBack at WWDC in June, Apple finally revealed its approach to generative AI. The offering is an extremely Apple approach, right down to the name \u2014 Apple Intelligence \u2014 which happily hijacks the familiar AI initialism. The \u201csmall model\u201d method is emblematic of the company in the sense that it\u2019s trained on limited data relevant to improving the user experience.\n\nThat\u2019s a marked difference between it and much larger \u201cblack box\u201d models like OpenAI\u2019s and Google\u2019s Gemini. The efficacy of the approach remains to be seen, as we wait for Apple Intelligence\u2019s wider release. It will almost certainly be a work in progress, as \u2014 at the very least \u2014 all of generative AI is, at the end of the day.\n\nThe answer for how this all ties into \u201cGlowtime\u201d can be found in Siri. In June, Apple announced a much-needed glow up for the O.G. smart assistant. Along with generative AI models and better app integration, the company revealed an updated interface. Gone is the familiar colorful Siri circle, swapped out for a glowing border that surrounds the display when Siri is listening/processing.\n\nOut of every iPhone ever launched, two models will be able to run Apple Intelligence: the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. According to the company, that\u2019s due to limitations with older chips. Given that non-Pro iPhone 15 models are effectively running the iPhone 14 Pro\u2019s chipset, Apple can credibly make the argument that only one of its chips so far was built with Apple Intelligence in mind. You can decide for yourself whether you think the exclusion of the iPhone 15 is entirely a hardware matter.\n\nWith all of this in mind, next week\u2019s event is the perfect chance to announce that Apple Intelligence will be available across the new iPhone line.\n\niPhone 16, 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max\n\nImage Credits: Stanislav Kogiku / SOPA Images / LightRocket / Getty Images\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to feature the thinnest bezels on a smartphone \ud83d\udd25 pic.twitter.com/rK9LEugcb1 \u2014 Apple Hub (@theapplehub) September 1, 2024\n\nWe\u2019re heading toward the promise of true edge-to-edge displays millimeter by millimeter. According to one recent leak, the iPhone 16 Pro Max may get an even larger display, courtesy of smaller bezels, moving from 1.5mm to 1.4mm. So, what\u2019s a few fractions of a millimeter between friends? A lot when you\u2019re talking about a total size of under 2mm, turns out.\n\nThat will reportedly bump the Pro Max\u2019s screen size from 6.69 to 6.86 inches, without increasing the device\u2019s overall footprint by some unwieldy amount. The iPhone 15 Pro Max is already a big phone. The iPhone 16 Pro, meanwhile, is said to be making the leap from 6.12 to 6.27 inches.\n\nCamera improvements are a no-brainer for annual updates. The most interesting of the bunch is a new glass molded lens that is thinner and lighter, while dramatically increasing optical zoom capabilities. Optical zoom capabilities are worth paying attention to, as they don\u2019t suffer from the same sort of image degradation issues as their digital counterpart.\n\nLeaked dummy models from early in the year give us a rough idea of each model\u2019s design. Most notable on the 16 and 16 Plus are the shift from a diagonal to vertical camera setup. The models, which are designed for third parties to get a jumpstart on accessories, feature the addition of a new \u201cCapture\u201d button across the line. The new feature is designed to provide quick access to different camera capabilities.\n\nThe most welcome change, however, may be bigger batteries. Screen and camera improvements are all well and good, but battery life remains a struggle. This particular report could use more substantiating, so take that with an even larger grain of salt than usual. Additional reports, meanwhile, have pointed to Apple making battery replacements more accessible for users. Given that the company has begun offering home repair options as more governments and localities pass right to repair laws, this one certainly tracks.\n\nThe Pro models are also expected to gain Wi-Fi 7, which would be a big boon for the latest wireless standard.\n\nApple Watch Series 10/Ultra 3\n\nImage Credits: Apple\n\nAs hard as it is to believe, the Apple Watch turns 10 this year. They grow up so quickly. Apple made a big splash with the iPhone X, so it follows that it\u2019d have something similar planned for the Apple Watch Series 10 (Series X?). Earlier rumors pointing to a significant redesign have cooled in recent months, making way for a familiar design with a larger display, bumping up to 45mm and 49mm models. The new watch should also be slimmer than its predecessor \u2014 something especially important when discussing a watch.\n\nLike the iPhone 16, the Apple Watch Series 10 and Ultra 3 should get a new processor \u2014 the S10, one imagines. That could mean that additional AI functionality isn\u2019t far out. A glucose monitor is the most exciting rumored addition. Sleep apnea detection is also rumored for the device, but as Bloomberg notes, Apple\u2019s legal woes with Masimo may well trip up that feature.\n\nA long-awaited update to the budget Apple Watch SE with a plastic body could also appear next week.\n\nAirPods 4\n\nImage Credits: Apple\n\nStay with me on this one. Apple is reportedly announcing two versions of the AirPods 4 next week. The cheaper model will replace the still-available AirPods 2, and the more premium version will replace the AirPods 3. Still with me? The more premium model is set to blur the line between it and the AirPods Pro, by adding Active Noise Cancelation and Find My features. All of the models should also finally ditch Lightning for USB-C, as the company transitions its products to comply with EU mandates.\n\nSo, how will Apple maintain a clear line between the mid-tier and Pro pods? We\u2019ll have to wait on the answer to that one, as we\u2019re not expecting new AirPods Pro next week. We may, however, finally get the over-ear AirPods Max 2, four years after the original.\n\nNew Macs\n\nImage Credits: Brian Heater\n\nThis one is a big maybe. Recent reporting suggests that Apple will hold off on announcing M4 macs until November. Supply chain issues have been dictating the Mac\u2019s release calendar ever since the pandemic. A big, USB-A-less version of the Mac Mini is said to be arriving before end of year, along with a new iMac and MacBook Pro.\n\nGlow with the flow\n\nImage Credits: Apple\n\nHere\u2019s what we can say for sure: Apple\u2019s Glowtime event is scheduled for Monday, September 9 at 10 a.m. PT. As always, we\u2019ll be there, bringing it to you live.",

        "text": "Prevention is better than cure, as the saying goes. Today, a splashy startup that has taken that concept to heart \u2014 literally and figuratively \u2014 is expanding.\n\nNeko Health was co-founded by Spotify\u2019s Daniel Ek and Hjalmar Nilsonne with a mission to improve preventative healthcare with annual full body scans and AI-powered insights that can detect conditions like heart disease and skin cancer. Now, the Swedish company is launching in London, its first city outside of its home market.\n\nFor \u00a3299 and an hour of your time, the company runs a series of scans and tests that it says creates \u201cmillions\u201d of datapoints that help determine your state of health across a range of cardiovascular, metabolic, and other conditions. An in-person meeting with a doctor to discuss the data is included in the session. Those interested in getting in line for a visit can sign up here.\n\nThe company is coming to the U.K. on the heels of a strong start in Stockholm, where it has opened two clinics in its first year of operation. To date, it has scanned 2,707 people, and while 78.5% of them were found to have no health issues, results for some 14.1% of visitors raised issues that required further medical treatment. Some 1%, it said, were identified to have \u201csevere\u201d cardiovascular, metabolic, or cancerous conditions. Of that group, none were aware of their conditions prior to visiting Neko, the company said.\n\nNeko is Japanese for \u201ccat\u201d and Nilsonne tells me that it\u2019s a reference to cats having nine lives, or more specifically a lot of lucky breaks. \u201cThat\u2019s how we would hope that our system feels for our users,\u201d he said.\n\nA visit to the Neko clinic\n\nDespite the participation of a major tech figure like Ek, the company\u2019s ethos is actually very understated. As a result, it sometimes gets in its own way.\n\nWhen I visited the London clinic to go through the testing process to write this article, it took me a few trips up and down a London street to realise that I had walked straight past the Neko clinic, which was marked only by its logo \u2014 an N sliced and shifted through its waistline \u2014 at the top of a glass doorway. The rest of the operation is below ground level, making the street-level lobby look more like a discreet entry to a fancy apartment block rather than a health center.\n\nOnce you enter the building and descend the stairs, you enter an equally sparse lobby with pared-down furniture, muted colours and lighting, and low-volume, soothing electronic music piped throughout. The concept is somewhere between elegant day spa and futuristic medical clinic.\n\nOnce there, you\u2019re funnelled through their system. An assistant takes a few notes about you before leading you into a room where you strip down to your underpants, a robe, and slippers. A second assistant then measures your height and weight before moving you to a cylindrical chamber that feels like a cross between a tanning booth and a security scanner at an airport.\n\nThe chamber itself is fitted with 70 sensors, including dozens of volumetric and other cameras, to produce a composite picture of you with 50 million data points. From there, you move to an examination bed, where you have another two scans, measurements of your eye pressure and blood pressure, and a grip test. Finally, the the clinician draws a blood sample.\n\nThe blood sample is the only invasive test that Neko carries out, and altogether the experience takes under an hour. Soon after, you change and are taken to a separate consultation room where a doctor goes through your data.\n\nNeko\u2019s focus is on risks and proactive prevention rather than existing conditions. Data points are grouped and presented along the lines of different potential problems you might encounter related to them \u2014 among them skin cancer (my moles were counted and it seems that I have many more than the average person), high blood pressure, and metabolic syndrome (a group of conditions that can lead to illnesses such as heart disease, stroke, and diabetes).\n\nIf the data reveals problems, you\u2019re referred for more diagnostics and channeled to doctors for further examinations.\n\nUnlikely beginnings\n\nNilsonne tells me that Ek first approached him to chat about healthcare over a Twitter direct message.\n\nThe year was 2018, and Nilsonne\u2019s company at the time \u2014 an AI-powered,smart home energy monitoring startup \u2014 was running out of money and winding down after failing to find product-market fit with the big energy companies it expected to be its customers.\n\n\u201cThen out of nowhere, I get a direct message on Twitter from Daniel.\u201d Ek had just taken audio streaming platform Spotify through an IPO and was a newly minted billionaire looking for another thorny problem to solve, something that would have \u201ca positive contribution to the world,\u201d in Nilsonne\u2019s words. He\u2019d gotten it into his head that he wanted to reinvent healthcare, just as he\u2019d reinvented recorded music consumption with Spotify.\n\n\u201cSo he reached out to me. We didn\u2019t know each other, but he was aware of what I had been doing, working with hardware and software and AI.\u201d\n\nEk offered to fund a startup with Nilsonne at the head on the spot, but Nilsonne at first rejected him. Neither of them have a medical background. But Nilsonne does come from a family of doctors so it\u2019s in his consciousness, and Ek was obsessed, so the two kept talking, and they could see something starting to take shape.\n\nWearables like Fitbits and Apple Watches, Nilsonne said, have led to an \u201cincredible explosion of abundance of high-quality health information.\u201d Combining that with AI and the ability to draw \u201csensible conclusions\u201d from all this data, \u201cit was very clear that we could create a different healthcare system.\u201d Thus began five years of building prototypes for the physical clinics and their component hardware, as well as the software to analyse the data.\n\nNeko itself, plus its co-founders Nilsonne and Ek, come from an unlikely location. Sweden is home to one of the world\u2019s most famous socialised medicine programs. You might assume that the existence of free, and good, healthcare would make a paid service like Neko a hard-sell to consumers. But so far at least, the opposite has been true.\n\nWhen the company last year announced a $60 million funding round, it had a waiting list of \u201cthousands\u201d lined up to get scans. Now that list is up to 22,000.\n\nYes, some of that might be down to Neko being the latest project from one of Sweden\u2019s most famous living entrepreneurs (who is also one of Neko\u2019s major investors by way of his investment vehicle, Prima Materia). But Nilsonne believes Neko is addressing an important gap that will give the startup staying power.\n\nThe majority of healthcare services, including those in Sweden and the U.K., are focused on treating conditions rather than preventative care. But because our populations are aging, the number of conditions that need treatment are rapidly increasing, and that\u2019s putting the whole system under pressure \u201cin an unsustainable way,\u201d Nilsonne said, explaining that 75% of healthcare costs go towards chronic diseases.\n\n\u201cOur hypothesis is that prevention and early detection could to be the things that would solve a lot of these problems. Most chronic conditions are fully preventable, or you can delay them by decades if you have effective early interventions. But of course, in our system, you basically show up when you already have the disease, and then it\u2019s too late to reverse them, and there are a lot of costs associated with it.\u201d (It is far from being the only startup focusing on preventative healthcare technology. Zoi in France and Germany\u2019s Aware are two in Europe;\n\nIn the U.K., the NHS does offer a Health Check that covers many of the same areas that Neko does, although as Nilsonne points out, it\u2019s less frequent.\n\n\u201cThe NHS health check is available only once every five years to individuals aged 44 to 74,\u201d he points out. \u201cIt offers a much narrower range of tests and does not include a consultation with a doctor to discuss the results. We know from our data that chronic diseases are increasingly appearing in individuals under 44\u201d \u2014 which also happens to be the average age of a Neko customer \u2014 \u201cTherefore, it\u2019s crucial to adopt a proactive approach to health to identify potential issues early, take corrective action, and monitor progress over time.\u201d",
